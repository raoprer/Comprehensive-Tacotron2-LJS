p304_219|p304|It isn't a happy memory.
p304_027|p304|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p304_033|p304|They agree to meet.
p304_190|p304|I saw the whole thing.
p304_184|p304|An announcement is expected today on their future.
p304_153|p304|You need a trademark.
p304_147|p304|They were due to have begun today.
p304_392|p304|That's the way things are heading.
p304_386|p304|Many other areas are coming up.
p304_351|p304|It is no place for a poet.
p304_345|p304|Things start to talk to each other.
p304_423|p304|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p304_379|p304|Motorists will welcome this.
p304_378|p304|Well, what can you do?
p304_344|p304|What do we do for an encore?
p304_422|p304|I will go out with him any time.
p304_350|p304|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p304_387|p304|But it's a subtle process.
p304_393|p304|Hard it will be.
p304_146|p304|This is a total mystery.
p304_152|p304|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p304_185|p304|There were so many characters among them.
p304_191|p304|There is a demand for another hospice.
p304_032|p304|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p304_026|p304|Who cares about that?
p304_218|p304|That is why it is so lyrical.
p304_230|p304|That could run into millions.
p304_224|p304|He was correct in everything he did.
p304_232|p304|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
p304_226|p304|I never agreed with that.
p304_030|p304|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p304_024|p304|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p304_018|p304|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p304_187|p304|We could not get any possession.
p304_193|p304|Then they were awarded a penalty.
p304_144|p304|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p304_150|p304|It will be easier for us.
p304_178|p304|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p304_385|p304|Clubs can only do so much.
p304_391|p304|I don't care to recall it.
p304_420|p304|That, though, was then.
p304_346|p304|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p304_352|p304|There is room for me.
p304_408|p304|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p304_409|p304|We are not too surprised.
p304_353|p304|My life is in the ballet.
p304_421|p304|People should not become complacent.
p304_347|p304|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p304_390|p304|Changes need to be made.
p304_384|p304|I didn't know where they were.
p304_179|p304|The real world is full of competing causes.
p304_151|p304|I'm pleased for him.
p304_145|p304|You have to think not.
p304_192|p304|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p304_186|p304|Or is it the European approach?
p304_019|p304|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p304_025|p304|So we will cut their numbers.
p304_031|p304|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p304_227|p304|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p304_233|p304|I'm really excited about the album.
p304_237|p304|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p304_223|p304|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p304_009|p304|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p304_035|p304|But there was a heavy price to pay.
p304_021|p304|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p304_182|p304|These are terrible offences.
p304_196|p304|I see that any day now.
p304_169|p304|He asked me how they were doing.
p304_141|p304|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p304_155|p304|Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
p304_380|p304|It is not the message alone.
p304_394|p304|He just attracted people.
p304_419|p304|I can understand why they have gone.
p304_343|p304|There wasn't anything in it.
p304_357|p304|These will take a little time to develop.
p304_356|p304|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p304_342|p304|It's all about money, money, money.
p304_424|p304|Public safety is paramount.
p304_418|p304|We would all have liked to run.
p304_395|p304|It was better than a soap opera.
p304_381|p304|She failed to win any of them.
p304_154|p304|This is our Olympics.
p304_140|p304|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p304_168|p304|It is a symbolic concert.
p304_197|p304|But who knows?
p304_183|p304|This is it finally finished.
p304_020|p304|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p304_034|p304|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p304_008|p304|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p304_222|p304|We have a team to reach the final.
p304_236|p304|You can't have it both ways.
p304_208|p304|Some examples are presented in detail.
p304_220|p304|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p304_234|p304|We were desperate to get the game on.
p304_022|p304|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p304_036|p304|The most important thing was to win today.
p304_195|p304|They will have five minutes to decide.
p304_181|p304|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p304_156|p304|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p304_142|p304|That's a pretty good percentage.
p304_397|p304|You must be ready to play anyone.
p304_383|p304|I think we're going to make it.
p304_368|p304|My neighbours are horrified.
p304_354|p304|For next season, we have time to restructure.
p304_340|p304|They should be looking at his victims.
p304_341|p304|There were many positives for this club.
p304_355|p304|The truth, of course, is very different.
p304_369|p304|He had no problem with alcohol.
p304_382|p304|He is at war with his knee.
p304_396|p304|I doubt it would be genuine.
p304_143|p304|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p304_157|p304|My goal was very important to the team.
p304_180|p304|They've got to decide to do that.
p304_194|p304|Journalists should make him.
p304_037|p304|We have a strong team at the moment.
p304_023|p304|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p304_235|p304|But there is a possible place.
p304_221|p304|Who would be a referee?
p304_209|p304|You cannot understand it until you experience it.
p304_285|p304|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p304_291|p304|You are not going in blind.
p304_246|p304|He can perform well under pressure.
p304_252|p304|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p304_087|p304|He was determined to write a novel.
p304_093|p304|But we are losing that connection.
p304_044|p304|Scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304_050|p304|His father said, My son was lucky.
p304_078|p304|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304_130|p304|You would be a fool not to listen.
p304_124|p304|But he admits he is deeply upset.
p304_118|p304|How can we ignore it?
p304_332|p304|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p304_326|p304|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p304_327|p304|You are a gambling man.
p304_333|p304|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p304_119|p304|It's totally double standards.
p304_125|p304|We told them in August.
p304_131|p304|No other offers apply.
p304_079|p304|Could it be?
p304_051|p304|But they also came with a downside.
p304_045|p304|I was doing a charity concert.
p304_092|p304|It was one he was born to play.
p304_086|p304|I have a theory.
p304_253|p304|He wouldn't have played in all three.
p304_247|p304|I've enjoyed the whole experience.
p304_290|p304|He is keen to stay in public service.
p304_284|p304|He called for a public inquiry.
p304_292|p304|You had to go and see him.
p304_286|p304|I played badly, but it happens.
p304_251|p304|They have the cash to do that.
p304_245|p304|We want to learn lessons from that.
p304_279|p304|We are not asking for the moon.
p304_090|p304|They've got their own agenda.
p304_084|p304|Nor should there have been.
p304_053|p304|Are you listening, All Saints?
p304_047|p304|It is not about changing our image.
p304_127|p304|That could be at least five years away.
p304_133|p304|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p304_325|p304|I hope he has learned from it.
p304_331|p304|Our strategy is straightforward.
p304_319|p304|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p304_318|p304|I don't understand it.
p304_330|p304|The matter will come up again.
p304_324|p304|We are all ecstatic.
p304_132|p304|Have you noticed?
p304_126|p304|We are going to have a parade.
p304_046|p304|You have to have a sense of humour.
p304_052|p304|She was only doing her job.
p304_085|p304|Smoking is also very important.
p304_091|p304|This commitment should be built upon.
p304_278|p304|It is my fault.
p304_244|p304|Now it has become a big picture.
p304_250|p304|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p304_287|p304|I have got a wife to feed.
p304_293|p304|She says she has grown up.
p304_297|p304|What will they called?
p304_283|p304|Teachers have been given the offer.
p304_268|p304|We then went to see the headmaster.
p304_254|p304|And that includes the Barnett formula.
p304_240|p304|They also have good neighbours.
p304_095|p304|I am about protecting the state pension.
p304_081|p304|They had failed to explode.
p304_056|p304|I'm very angry about it.
p304_042|p304|It was an ambush.
p304_122|p304|We are taking the back seat on this.
p304_136|p304|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p304_308|p304|We are the gateway to justice.
p304_320|p304|He was rejected because he had retired.
p304_334|p304|They were unable to revive him.
p304_335|p304|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p304_321|p304|And then we got off the plane.
p304_309|p304|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
p304_137|p304|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p304_123|p304|It was a privilege to work for him.
p304_043|p304|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p304_057|p304|I have great respect for all my players.
p304_080|p304|It is bad news for us and England.
p304_094|p304|He was jailed for five years.
p304_241|p304|We are now open.
p304_255|p304|It is a great shame.
p304_269|p304|I needed a little man in the crowd.
p304_282|p304|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p304_296|p304|It makes no sense.
p304_280|p304|That used to be another thing of mine.
p304_294|p304|He met his wife and married in England.
p304_243|p304|There is no pressure from anyone now.
p304_257|p304|The council has been open and transparent.
p304_082|p304|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p304_096|p304|We will look into it.
p304_069|p304|We have avoided that at least.
p304_041|p304|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p304_055|p304|I guess it is down to focus.
p304_109|p304|I can't believe it's all gone.
p304_135|p304|It was a takeover.
p304_121|p304|It's something he works hard at achieving.
p304_337|p304|It is not for me, though.
p304_323|p304|I am totally surprised.
p304_322|p304|I think it is wide open.
p304_336|p304|Yes, it was too short a night.
p304_120|p304|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p304_134|p304|The Lobby is not failing.
p304_108|p304|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
p304_054|p304|And then came the seventies.
p304_040|p304|He is dying from cancer.
p304_068|p304|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p304_097|p304|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p304_083|p304|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p304_256|p304|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p304_242|p304|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p304_295|p304|But it could have been written for her.
p304_281|p304|At the election we will oppose the euro.
p304_298|p304|We come here in peace, for peace.
p304_267|p304|I can certainly see much better.
p304_273|p304|It was a very difficult period.
p304_065|p304|If you can get away with it, you do it.
p304_071|p304|I do not believe they are.
p304_059|p304|For a moment it was all about her.
p304_111|p304|We will meet again.
p304_105|p304|He did not know his daughter.
p304_139|p304|But we have to plan for the future.
p304_313|p304|It added to the reverence.
p304_307|p304|At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
p304_306|p304|He is married, with two children.
p304_312|p304|The working families tax credit is far better.
p304_138|p304|How many cases have there been?
p304_104|p304|Four people died instantly.
p304_110|p304|I am just going to go for it.
p304_058|p304|His track record is not promising.
p304_070|p304|I love a clever reader.
p304_064|p304|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p304_272|p304|People were actually not on his side.
p304_266|p304|The look on his face was something special.
p304_299|p304|He will feel the pain again.
p304_270|p304|It would then be up to the judge.
p304_264|p304|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p304_258|p304|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p304_099|p304|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p304_072|p304|That is completely against Islam.
p304_066|p304|First is open defiance.
p304_106|p304|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
p304_112|p304|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p304_304|p304|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p304_310|p304|We understand the changes in the world.
p304_338|p304|It really was my favourite.
p304_339|p304|That is why this action has been taken.
p304_311|p304|It is a potential factor.
p304_305|p304|I can't say that this is very usual.
p304_113|p304|Part of the complex is historic.
p304_107|p304|Our children are the future of our society.
p304_067|p304|You probably have never seen them before.
p304_073|p304|Clearly, there will have to be changes.
p304_098|p304|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p304_259|p304|I felt he was excellent.
p304_265|p304|He has changed the country itself.
p304_271|p304|Are we going to stay up?
p304_249|p304|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p304_275|p304|It used to be less than five minutes.
p304_261|p304|The results are sometimes contentious.
p304_088|p304|So is there anything left to say?
p304_077|p304|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p304_063|p304|No details were disclosed.
p304_103|p304|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
p304_117|p304|This is not about revenge.
p304_329|p304|The search has been called off.
p304_301|p304|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p304_315|p304|It's to do with context.
p304_314|p304|It is too early to say.
p304_300|p304|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p304_328|p304|Who honestly expected anything else?
p304_116|p304|Among them are many criminals.
p304_102|p304|There, you were just a body.
p304_062|p304|They don't know how to do it.
p304_076|p304|But, of course, it isn't.
p304_089|p304|My back is feeling really good.
p304_260|p304|It was a policy they were against.
p304_274|p304|It's all going to clear the debt.
p304_248|p304|He was totally without that form of fear.
p304_289|p304|What are the barriers?
p304_262|p304|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
p304_276|p304|It was by the numbers.
p304_048|p304|We are waiting for advice on the film.
p304_060|p304|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p304_074|p304|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p304_128|p304|That is my role.
p304_114|p304|We need to chat.
p304_100|p304|Did you get the script?
p304_316|p304|David Trimble has sold out.
p304_302|p304|Is Saddam a threat?
p304_303|p304|The jury is still out.
p304_317|p304|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p304_101|p304|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
p304_115|p304|Justice was not seen today.
p304_129|p304|Everyone can be bought.
p304_075|p304|I will wait until later.
p304_061|p304|Trading Places was too obvious.
p304_049|p304|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p304_277|p304|My Dad is a hero.
p304_263|p304|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p304_288|p304|I lost my head.
p304_204|p304|We should not worry about other players.
p304_210|p304|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p304_238|p304|But they will need to play to score.
p304_006|p304|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p304_012|p304|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p304_199|p304|That would be unlawful.
p304_172|p304|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
p304_166|p304|What has changed?
p304_416|p304|He took over our lives.
p304_370|p304|This was a very tragic accident.
p304_364|p304|That's how she wants to remember him.
p304_402|p304|His body was never found.
p304_358|p304|This is not a birthday party.
p304_359|p304|Darren is very, very good.
p304_365|p304|There was no disruption to services.
p304_403|p304|Just get on with your job.
p304_417|p304|I would think they are just behind them.
p304_371|p304|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p304_167|p304|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
p304_198|p304|He was tough and relentless.
p304_013|p304|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p304_007|p304|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p304_239|p304|He is a joy to watch.
p304_211|p304|I sincerely hope that will not change.
p304_205|p304|Ownership was the game.
p304_213|p304|It was total confusion.
p304_207|p304|I love the moment of being first.
p304_011|p304|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p304_005|p304|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p304_039|p304|The butcher is very good.
p304_165|p304|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p304_171|p304|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p304_159|p304|This is not a Scottish problem.
p304_398|p304|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p304_401|p304|We need to tighten up.
p304_367|p304|It was a discussion paper.
p304_373|p304|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p304_415|p304|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p304_372|p304|It is the voice of the survivors.
p304_414|p304|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p304_400|p304|It is the worst of both worlds.
p304_366|p304|We talk about effective military action.
p304_399|p304|It seems a waste of talents.
p304_158|p304|There are plenty examples.
p304_170|p304|They would have looked out for each other.
p304_164|p304|And there is no cause for it.
p304_038|p304|At half-time you have?
p304_004|p304|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p304_010|p304|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p304_206|p304|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p304_212|p304|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p304_216|p304|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p304_202|p304|That is no use.
p304_028|p304|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p304_014|p304|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p304_148|p304|Do not listen to them.
p304_160|p304|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p304_174|p304|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p304_389|p304|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p304_362|p304|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p304_404|p304|We expect a full house on the night.
p304_410|p304|They are not a set of options.
p304_376|p304|They say they feel different.
p304_411|p304|But it was money well spent.
p304_377|p304|We are in the hat.
p304_363|p304|She is still very poorly.
p304_405|p304|He said it was his greatest work.
p304_388|p304|But let's not go down that road.
p304_175|p304|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p304_161|p304|I have worked with him on projects.
p304_149|p304|So what makes it so special?
p304_001|p304|Please call Stella.
p304_015|p304|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p304_029|p304|I know my job.
p304_203|p304|They will want to perform well.
p304_217|p304|Such actions are rarely popular.
p304_229|p304|But he insisted that victory was possible.
p304_201|p304|The same goes for McKenna.
p304_215|p304|Pupils will be the losers.
p304_003|p304|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p304_017|p304|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p304_188|p304|Did you see that?
p304_177|p304|Nelson does not disappoint.
p304_163|p304|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p304_349|p304|That is a lot of writing.
p304_375|p304|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p304_413|p304|Which is worse?
p304_407|p304|They are different types.
p304_361|p304|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p304_406|p304|The baby deserves the credit.
p304_360|p304|It's a drop in the bucket.
p304_374|p304|I wish him well.
p304_412|p304|They would never let him go.
p304_348|p304|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p304_162|p304|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p304_176|p304|The result today is an impasse.
p304_189|p304|The cost of war is more than that.
p304_016|p304|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p304_002|p304|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p304_214|p304|I have learned from him.
p304_200|p304|This guy is amazing.
p304_228|p304|I don't think it is vital.
p303_098|p303|She is on a life support machine.
p303_265|p303|I've seen some of the submissions.
p303_271|p303|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p303_259|p303|Do you think you have a shot?
p303_311|p303|That was moving the goalposts.
p303_305|p303|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p303_339|p303|Some of his family still live there.
p303_113|p303|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p303_107|p303|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p303_106|p303|The luxury has been well used.
p303_112|p303|Tell you the team he picked?
p303_338|p303|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p303_304|p303|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p303_310|p303|The crowd was awesome.
p303_258|p303|They have a very good method of working.
p303_270|p303|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p303_264|p303|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p303_099|p303|Their vision was not impeded.
p303_072|p303|What do they pay to join the club?
p303_066|p303|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p303_070|p303|Repayment is not part of the game.
p303_064|p303|Seven children had lost both parents.
p303_058|p303|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p303_272|p303|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p303_266|p303|There is no such thing.
p303_299|p303|And he had much need.
p303_306|p303|Some have other commitments.
p303_312|p303|We have the location, which is assured.
p303_104|p303|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p303_110|p303|There was no time scale.
p303_138|p303|It could have been a hammering by now.
p303_139|p303|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p303_111|p303|Only the scale of change differed.
p303_105|p303|Referees are easy targets.
p303_313|p303|Rapid revision was required.
p303_307|p303|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p303_298|p303|I felt the head was very like me.
p303_267|p303|I feel very strongly about that.
p303_273|p303|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
p303_059|p303|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p303_065|p303|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p303_071|p303|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p303_049|p303|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p303_075|p303|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p303_061|p303|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p303_277|p303|Last year, however, was a different story.
p303_263|p303|We've had great things in the past.
p303_288|p303|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p303_317|p303|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p303_129|p303|We have great team spirit.
p303_101|p303|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p303_115|p303|I'd like to take the plunge.
p303_114|p303|The cold war is over.
p303_100|p303|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p303_128|p303|A lot of people were in tears.
p303_316|p303|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p303_302|p303|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p303_289|p303|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p303_262|p303|She may even appear in some more films.
p303_276|p303|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p303_060|p303|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p303_074|p303|We are now in a safe place.
p303_048|p303|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p303_062|p303|Don't say you have not been warned.
p303_076|p303|It will be very useful for us.
p303_089|p303|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p303_248|p303|It is the end of an era.
p303_260|p303|I believe we have a good chance.
p303_274|p303|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p303_328|p303|Who is going to be penalised?
p303_314|p303|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p303_300|p303|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p303_116|p303|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p303_102|p303|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p303_103|p303|He went to see what he could learn.
p303_117|p303|And it's more subversive.
p303_301|p303|This can only help us go forward.
p303_315|p303|We couldn't go very fast.
p303_329|p303|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p303_275|p303|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p303_261|p303|Things were not easy from the outset.
p303_249|p303|We can just get on with our game.
p303_088|p303|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p303_077|p303|He was obviously very genuine.
p303_063|p303|That is a mark of what you are.
p303_004|p303|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p303_010|p303|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p303_038|p303|It was a crucial moment.
p303_206|p303|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p303_212|p303|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p303_170|p303|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p303_164|p303|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p303_158|p303|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p303_159|p303|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p303_165|p303|It is quite an eye opener.
p303_171|p303|It's just that we see different things.
p303_213|p303|They should also have the right to vote.
p303_207|p303|The line-up is a tasty one.
p303_039|p303|We gave everything we had.
p303_011|p303|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p303_005|p303|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p303_013|p303|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p303_007|p303|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p303_211|p303|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p303_205|p303|I'm going with all three.
p303_239|p303|I think in three dimensions.
p303_167|p303|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p303_173|p303|We're all family men with children.
p303_198|p303|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p303_199|p303|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p303_172|p303|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p303_166|p303|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p303_238|p303|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p303_204|p303|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p303_210|p303|He had taken everything from me.
p303_006|p303|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p303_012|p303|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p303_016|p303|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p303_002|p303|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p303_228|p303|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p303_214|p303|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p303_200|p303|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p303_348|p303|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p303_162|p303|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p303_176|p303|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p303_189|p303|It is simple and easy to use.
p303_188|p303|Glasgow then took control.
p303_177|p303|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p303_163|p303|It's now down in black and white.
p303_349|p303|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p303_201|p303|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p303_215|p303|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p303_229|p303|But there has never been the time, she said.
p303_003|p303|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p303_017|p303|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p303_029|p303|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p303_001|p303|Please call Stella.
p303_015|p303|The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p303_203|p303|You can be sure we will have problems.
p303_217|p303|They had given up on him.
p303_149|p303|I expected these kind of questions.
p303_175|p303|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p303_161|p303|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p303_160|p303|They were both delightful to work with.
p303_174|p303|I think we showed that after half time.
p303_148|p303|All kinds of things occur.
p303_216|p303|People are so negative about the whole business.
p303_202|p303|I am not a happy man.
p303_014|p303|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p303_028|p303|That is just a load of baloney.
p303_025|p303|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p303_031|p303|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p303_019|p303|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p303_227|p303|It's been a long, long journey.
p303_233|p303|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p303_353|p303|This represents a tough game for us.
p303_347|p303|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p303_151|p303|It is always the same, isn't it?
p303_145|p303|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p303_179|p303|One person was believed to have been hit.
p303_192|p303|I think we finished fifth.
p303_186|p303|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p303_187|p303|Our people should be immune.
p303_193|p303|It was not a foul.
p303_178|p303|You let a lot of people down.
p303_144|p303|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p303_150|p303|It was fit for royalty.
p303_346|p303|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p303_352|p303|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p303_232|p303|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p303_226|p303|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p303_018|p303|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p303_030|p303|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p303_024|p303|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p303_032|p303|The feeling is marvellous.
p303_026|p303|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p303_230|p303|This could be one such case, he declared.
p303_224|p303|I was living with my mum.
p303_218|p303|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p303_344|p303|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p303_350|p303|People tended to stay there for some time.
p303_146|p303|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p303_152|p303|Who would take it now, after all this?
p303_185|p303|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p303_191|p303|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p303_190|p303|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p303_184|p303|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p303_153|p303|I felt really good until Friday.
p303_147|p303|I always knew she was funny.
p303_351|p303|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p303_345|p303|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p303_219|p303|It has made me feel good.
p303_225|p303|It did my image a lot of good!
p303_231|p303|I fell in love with ballet.
p303_027|p303|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p303_033|p303|I think they should have more respect.
p303_037|p303|Others may be trying to catch up.
p303_023|p303|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p303_209|p303|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p303_235|p303|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p303_221|p303|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p303_341|p303|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p303_143|p303|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p303_157|p303|There is precious little middle ground.
p303_180|p303|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p303_194|p303|We know them as mobile telephones.
p303_195|p303|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p303_181|p303|We aren't going to play better.
p303_156|p303|Equity declined to comment.
p303_142|p303|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p303_340|p303|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p303_220|p303|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p303_234|p303|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p303_208|p303|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p303_022|p303|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p303_036|p303|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p303_008|p303|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p303_020|p303|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p303_034|p303|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p303_222|p303|She has now been registered as disabled.
p303_236|p303|We're still talking with a few people.
p303_342|p303|I get to work with very good people.
p303_168|p303|Can they be serious?
p303_154|p303|That gives us something to kick against.
p303_140|p303|I played really well on the back nine.
p303_197|p303|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p303_183|p303|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p303_182|p303|They just would not have run away.
p303_196|p303|I don't know exactly what happened.
p303_141|p303|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p303_155|p303|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p303_169|p303|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p303_343|p303|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p303_237|p303|But one shouldn't go by that.
p303_223|p303|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p303_035|p303|They are interior designers and architects.
p303_021|p303|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p303_009|p303|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p303_046|p303|I did not want any damage to us.
p303_052|p303|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p303_085|p303|We really need research to help with that.
p303_091|p303|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p303_244|p303|All were later allowed home.
p303_250|p303|But first it goes out on TV.
p303_278|p303|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p303_287|p303|There is no smoking gun.
p303_293|p303|I felt under no pressure today.
p303_330|p303|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p303_324|p303|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p303_318|p303|We have grown up in Britain.
p303_132|p303|They should take their mobile phones.
p303_126|p303|Will they ever reopen?
p303_127|p303|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p303_133|p303|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p303_319|p303|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p303_325|p303|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p303_331|p303|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p303_292|p303|I have been coming here for nine years.
p303_286|p303|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p303_279|p303|I bought a car at auction.
p303_251|p303|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p303_245|p303|She has a wonderful mind.
p303_090|p303|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p303_084|p303|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p303_053|p303|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p303_047|p303|It was an easy decision to come here.
p303_051|p303|This guy is never going to give up.
p303_045|p303|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p303_079|p303|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p303_092|p303|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p303_086|p303|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p303_253|p303|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p303_247|p303|We're into that build-up now.
p303_290|p303|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p303_284|p303|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p303_327|p303|They will want to watch a winning team.
p303_333|p303|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p303_125|p303|I asked why he had come.
p303_131|p303|He loves the big occasions.
p303_119|p303|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p303_118|p303|We are losing this war.
p303_130|p303|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p303_124|p303|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p303_332|p303|I have a theory.
p303_326|p303|What is the truth about the cow?
p303_285|p303|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p303_291|p303|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p303_246|p303|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p303_252|p303|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p303_087|p303|There were no passengers on board.
p303_093|p303|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p303_078|p303|We just try to make great records.
p303_044|p303|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p303_050|p303|I saw them not long after it happened.
p303_068|p303|Some people still think she should be English.
p303_054|p303|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p303_040|p303|I let go the telephone and ran.
p303_097|p303|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p303_083|p303|His parenthood is called into question.
p303_256|p303|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p303_242|p303|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p303_295|p303|And that was the adults.
p303_281|p303|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p303_322|p303|It is too early to speculate.
p303_336|p303|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p303_108|p303|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p303_120|p303|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p303_134|p303|We have big ideas.
p303_135|p303|I first met him last summer.
p303_121|p303|They will know they deserve to be there.
p303_109|p303|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p303_337|p303|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p303_323|p303|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p303_280|p303|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p303_294|p303|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p303_243|p303|How can they engage with the work?
p303_257|p303|They seem to be backing off from that.
p303_082|p303|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p303_096|p303|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p303_041|p303|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p303_055|p303|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p303_069|p303|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p303_043|p303|This is purely financial.
p303_057|p303|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p303_080|p303|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p303_094|p303|Scotland were beaten again.
p303_269|p303|After that nothing could save him.
p303_241|p303|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p303_255|p303|We have reacted well to each other.
p303_282|p303|She had been sexually assaulted.
p303_296|p303|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p303_309|p303|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p303_335|p303|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p303_321|p303|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p303_137|p303|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p303_123|p303|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p303_122|p303|I've got no secret.
p303_136|p303|It was to be published next month.
p303_320|p303|I am proud of those guys.
p303_334|p303|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p303_308|p303|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p303_297|p303|That is a job for the Government.
p303_283|p303|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p303_254|p303|I learned a lot from her.
p303_240|p303|They had four children together.
p303_268|p303|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p303_095|p303|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p303_081|p303|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p303_056|p303|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p303_042|p303|His charisma is all on the course.
p335_065|p335|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p335_273|p335|The council has been open and transparent.
p335_267|p335|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p335_298|p335|A counter reaction was.
p335_307|p335|We must not go down that road.
p335_313|p335|The issues are very intense.
p335_139|p335|It was a moment of madness.
p335_105|p335|Which perhaps is just as well.
p335_111|p335|It is not fair.
p335_110|p335|Or was it?
p335_104|p335|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p335_138|p335|This is not presently the case.
p335_312|p335|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p335_306|p335|If not, he should go home.
p335_299|p335|He said he was sorry.
p335_266|p335|I think we've got the balance right.
p335_272|p335|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p335_064|p335|This must be wrong.
p335_070|p335|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p335_058|p335|Let's see that increase over the years.
p335_066|p335|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p335_072|p335|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p335_099|p335|That is nearly four people every day.
p335_258|p335|I watched a game.
p335_264|p335|I try not to expect anything.
p335_270|p335|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p335_338|p335|I put pressure on him.
p335_310|p335|I am not among its admirers.
p335_304|p335|We are now setting about finding them.
p335_112|p335|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p335_106|p335|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p335_107|p335|They receive a high profile in the media.
p335_113|p335|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p335_305|p335|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p335_311|p335|Hitches can be expected.
p335_339|p335|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p335_271|p335|Some may end up in hospital.
p335_265|p335|This is my home town.
p335_259|p335|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p335_098|p335|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p335_073|p335|Seven people were later detained by police.
p335_067|p335|I go home only once.
p335_063|p335|I've learned from my mistakes.
p335_077|p335|It's just for me.
p335_088|p335|I came up through the ranks.
p335_261|p335|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p335_275|p335|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p335_249|p335|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p335_315|p335|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p335_301|p335|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p335_329|p335|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p335_117|p335|Police were also perplexed.
p335_103|p335|We knew nothing about it.
p335_102|p335|This would not be my first choice.
p335_116|p335|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p335_328|p335|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p335_300|p335|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p335_314|p335|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p335_248|p335|I am deeply sorry they did.
p335_274|p335|We can do nothing about that.
p335_260|p335|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p335_089|p335|We still don't know what's happened.
p335_076|p335|He had a moustache.
p335_062|p335|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p335_074|p335|The team this year is going places.
p335_060|p335|These findings would be made public.
p335_048|p335|On reflection, it is more than that.
p335_276|p335|That is highly unfair.
p335_262|p335|Intensive care has been very busy.
p335_289|p335|On occasions he succeeded.
p335_302|p335|This will help our confidence.
p335_316|p335|The company's in good shape.
p335_100|p335|There are nine people here now.
p335_114|p335|The dealer is on notice.
p335_128|p335|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p335_129|p335|A win was a real achievement.
p335_115|p335|But it will backfire.
p335_101|p335|I like what has happened!
p335_317|p335|Dialogue is the key.
p335_303|p335|This looks like it is anything but open.
p335_288|p335|I just want to change my life.
p335_263|p335|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p335_277|p335|There is great demand for human cloning.
p335_049|p335|It is not normal practice.
p335_061|p335|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p335_075|p335|We should do everything at a stroke.
p335_012|p335|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p335_006|p335|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p335_238|p335|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p335_210|p335|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p335_204|p335|She was an only child.
p335_358|p335|Is my wife a racist?
p335_364|p335|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p335_402|p335|The review has been conducted fairly.
p335_416|p335|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p335_370|p335|It looks like paradise.
p335_166|p335|This will secure the future of our industry.
p335_172|p335|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p335_199|p335|There we were on the first tee.
p335_198|p335|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p335_173|p335|He is the example for all of us.
p335_167|p335|It's just a normal life.
p335_417|p335|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p335_371|p335|This means a great deal to the families.
p335_365|p335|But let's not get carried away.
p335_403|p335|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p335_359|p335|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p335_205|p335|It is best value.
p335_211|p335|The island will never recover.
p335_239|p335|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p335_007|p335|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p335_013|p335|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p335_039|p335|He will emerge as a world leader.
p335_005|p335|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p335_011|p335|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p335_207|p335|They should come forward.
p335_213|p335|You saw the pain he was in.
p335_373|p335|We were short of athletes.
p335_415|p335|I am in a very difficult position.
p335_401|p335|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p335_367|p335|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p335_398|p335|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p335_159|p335|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p335_171|p335|There's still time for that.
p335_165|p335|That nation is South Africa.
p335_164|p335|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p335_170|p335|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p335_158|p335|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p335_399|p335|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p335_400|p335|The conclusion is enthralling.
p335_366|p335|There was some merit in that.
p335_372|p335|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p335_414|p335|Jackson may well be right.
p335_212|p335|We are not ruling it out.
p335_206|p335|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p335_010|p335|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p335_004|p335|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p335_038|p335|Who does he think will win?
p335_014|p335|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p335_028|p335|Let's not go overboard.
p335_202|p335|I looked forward to it.
p335_216|p335|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p335_410|p335|Courtenay took over on tour.
p335_376|p335|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p335_362|p335|It feels like too much.
p335_404|p335|Friends of the family have given their support.
p335_389|p335|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p335_174|p335|It was an empowering journey.
p335_160|p335|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p335_148|p335|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p335_149|p335|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p335_161|p335|It's been a good year.
p335_175|p335|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p335_388|p335|I can't believe what has happened.
p335_363|p335|It was a job he loved.
p335_405|p335|You name it, they have it.
p335_411|p335|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p335_377|p335|Only local people are helping.
p335_217|p335|This doesn't have to be our future.
p335_203|p335|That is a brand name.
p335_029|p335|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p335_015|p335|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p335_001|p335|Please call Stella.
p335_017|p335|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p335_003|p335|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p335_215|p335|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p335_201|p335|Broke the birdie record.
p335_229|p335|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p335_407|p335|There was no cohesion.
p335_361|p335|It's being very carefully looked at.
p335_375|p335|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p335_413|p335|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p335_349|p335|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p335_163|p335|But the price has been very high.
p335_177|p335|Teams are always interesting to watch.
p335_188|p335|We just want to get stuck in now.
p335_189|p335|Do you come from Moscow?
p335_176|p335|Laura is an investment banker.
p335_162|p335|We've got the top three.
p335_348|p335|It was certainly intense.
p335_374|p335|Six other people were injured.
p335_412|p335|The game is now open.
p335_406|p335|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p335_360|p335|There is no openness.
p335_228|p335|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p335_200|p335|Next time around, it will be different.
p335_214|p335|That is not an easy thing.
p335_002|p335|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p335_016|p335|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p335_033|p335|But she was very human.
p335_027|p335|I believe in the Church.
p335_219|p335|She was a delightful person.
p335_231|p335|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p335_225|p335|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p335_379|p335|There's no support for it at all.
p335_345|p335|The songs are just so good.
p335_423|p335|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p335_351|p335|He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
p335_386|p335|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p335_392|p335|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p335_147|p335|It was worth a photograph.
p335_153|p335|There was a lot of resentment.
p335_184|p335|We didn't think anything would happen.
p335_190|p335|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p335_191|p335|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p335_185|p335|He had come of age.
p335_152|p335|The elections should have no role in this.
p335_146|p335|Mummy believed in one thing above all.
p335_393|p335|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p335_387|p335|It's our worst nightmare.
p335_350|p335|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
p335_344|p335|They are the heroes.
p335_422|p335|We are encouraged by the news.
p335_378|p335|There were three boys and two girls.
p335_224|p335|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p335_230|p335|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p335_218|p335|It is a court case.
p335_026|p335|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p335_032|p335|Well, what do you know?
p335_018|p335|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p335_024|p335|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p335_030|p335|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p335_226|p335|Both sides have to step back.
p335_232|p335|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p335_408|p335|There is no going back.
p335_352|p335|We were a shambles at the back.
p335_420|p335|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p335_346|p335|We have rebuilt and reformed.
p335_391|p335|You do that because you want to win.
p335_385|p335|I am not obsessed with sex.
p335_178|p335|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p335_150|p335|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p335_144|p335|It's all too short term.
p335_193|p335|I am delighted with today's win.
p335_187|p335|We do things in an appropriate way.
p335_186|p335|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p335_192|p335|That wasn't for me.
p335_145|p335|It's too big a risk to take.
p335_151|p335|I'd say we should give it a week.
p335_179|p335|They had been together for about three years.
p335_384|p335|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p335_390|p335|It's really nothing new.
p335_421|p335|But who gets on the tube?
p335_347|p335|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p335_353|p335|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p335_409|p335|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p335_233|p335|We are ready for the long haul.
p335_227|p335|This is wonderful news.
p335_031|p335|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p335_025|p335|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p335_019|p335|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p335_021|p335|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p335_035|p335|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p335_223|p335|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p335_237|p335|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p335_357|p335|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p335_343|p335|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p335_419|p335|He is not very big, either.
p335_394|p335|Partition is not an option.
p335_380|p335|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p335_155|p335|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p335_141|p335|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p335_169|p335|Where is the structure?
p335_196|p335|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p335_182|p335|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p335_183|p335|Whether this return was too soon.
p335_197|p335|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p335_168|p335|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p335_140|p335|Don't even bother applying.
p335_154|p335|Where is the anthrax?
p335_381|p335|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p335_395|p335|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p335_418|p335|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p335_342|p335|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p335_356|p335|The home was now under new management.
p335_236|p335|I don't have any answer for them.
p335_222|p335|This fact is supported by audience research.
p335_008|p335|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p335_034|p335|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p335_020|p335|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p335_036|p335|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p335_022|p335|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p335_234|p335|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p335_220|p335|They will have to make changes.
p335_208|p335|We don't say there was a massacre.
p335_340|p335|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p335_354|p335|It took more than two years.
p335_368|p335|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p335_383|p335|There is a job to be done.
p335_397|p335|The home team had an amazing start.
p335_142|p335|I do not own the vessel in question.
p335_156|p335|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p335_181|p335|Our customers come first.
p335_195|p335|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p335_194|p335|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p335_180|p335|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p335_157|p335|It's because they can't understand the language.
p335_143|p335|Racism has no place in any sport.
p335_396|p335|I'll tell you honestly.
p335_382|p335|Writing has diminished in value.
p335_369|p335|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p335_355|p335|There is access for disabled people.
p335_341|p335|With us, we just want them to respond.
p335_209|p335|That has not changed.
p335_221|p335|The next one comes up.
p335_235|p335|This is a big step up.
p335_023|p335|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p335_037|p335|There were no proposals on the table.
p335_078|p335|History is usually written by the victors.
p335_050|p335|But he just carried on anyway.
p335_044|p335|The failings are serious.
p335_093|p335|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p335_087|p335|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p335_252|p335|I think he was surprised.
p335_246|p335|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p335_291|p335|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p335_285|p335|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p335_326|p335|This is a national crisis.
p335_332|p335|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p335_118|p335|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p335_124|p335|The plane was in flames
p335_130|p335|This is the high point of my career.
p335_131|p335|That's the sort of game you want.
p335_125|p335|We represent a wide range of society.
p335_119|p335|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p335_333|p335|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p335_327|p335|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p335_284|p335|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p335_290|p335|He did not oppose the divorce.
p335_247|p335|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p335_253|p335|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p335_086|p335|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p335_092|p335|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p335_045|p335|The prognosis is excellent.
p335_051|p335|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p335_079|p335|It plans to return to this field.
p335_047|p335|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p335_053|p335|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p335_084|p335|They're completely different from each other.
p335_090|p335|His team management was protective.
p335_279|p335|Or rather he did and he didn't.
p335_245|p335|A friendship that will endure.
p335_251|p335|Who would have thought it?
p335_286|p335|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p335_292|p335|There are so many people to thank.
p335_319|p335|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p335_331|p335|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p335_325|p335|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p335_133|p335|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p335_127|p335|I've seen some of the submissions.
p335_126|p335|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p335_132|p335|My duty is to win.
p335_324|p335|You have to think not.
p335_330|p335|The whole thing would be perfect.
p335_318|p335|The actors are confident and polished.
p335_293|p335|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p335_287|p335|Others were even less confident.
p335_250|p335|Alex is a big part of that future.
p335_244|p335|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p335_278|p335|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p335_091|p335|The proposal was rejected.
p335_085|p335|He was extremely nervous.
p335_052|p335|I would not want to be young again.
p335_046|p335|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p335_042|p335|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p335_056|p335|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p335_081|p335|That would be dangerous.
p335_095|p335|These guys will not lie down.
p335_240|p335|EMI is a prime example.
p335_254|p335|Finally action had been taken.
p335_268|p335|I have good memories of Glasgow.
p335_283|p335|I think it will make a huge difference.
p335_297|p335|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p335_334|p335|However, we had no failures in our side.
p335_320|p335|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p335_308|p335|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p335_136|p335|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
p335_122|p335|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p335_123|p335|Wagner was never like this.
p335_137|p335|I am prepared to help make it happen.
p335_309|p335|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p335_321|p335|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p335_335|p335|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p335_296|p335|I'd never be free.
p335_282|p335|Arsenal considered the job done.
p335_269|p335|Nothing can bring back their son.
p335_255|p335|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p335_241|p335|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p335_094|p335|Four other charges were dropped.
p335_080|p335|He said because people had invited him.
p335_057|p335|They were later discharged from hospital.
p335_043|p335|All the oil companies are talking together.
p335_055|p335|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p335_041|p335|I only half believed it.
p335_069|p335|It is a family day out.
p335_096|p335|I would think they are just behind them.
p335_082|p335|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p335_257|p335|That gives us a bit of a chance.
p335_243|p335|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p335_294|p335|He is also a great finisher.
p335_280|p335|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p335_323|p335|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p335_337|p335|It is so damaging.
p335_121|p335|The final stage is paranoia.
p335_135|p335|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p335_109|p335|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p335_108|p335|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p335_134|p335|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p335_120|p335|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p335_336|p335|We will be stronger in Berlin.
p335_322|p335|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p335_281|p335|Government sources said, It is building up.
p335_295|p335|He knew it would cost him millions.
p335_242|p335|You cannot allow it to go on.
p335_256|p335|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p335_083|p335|We aim to put them out of business.
p335_097|p335|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p335_068|p335|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335_040|p335|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p335_054|p335|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p361_339|p361|They are a very good side, without a doubt.
p361_311|p361|A winter of discontent awaits.
p361_305|p361|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p361_259|p361|Or is he?
p361_265|p361|When she returned, it was a wreck.
p361_271|p361|It's not the tour.
p361_098|p361|What kind of person is he?
p361_067|p361|Nobody else is at risk.
p361_073|p361|It is on the news.
p361_072|p361|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p361_066|p361|But we are very near.
p361_099|p361|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p361_270|p361|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p361_264|p361|There is no other offer on the table.
p361_258|p361|He will appear in court today.
p361_304|p361|I will build a house on the site.
p361_310|p361|I think it's a good sign.
p361_338|p361|It is their day.
p361_106|p361|I've done a lot in that building.
p361_112|p361|Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
p361_138|p361|We needed someone and we now have him.
p361_104|p361|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p361_110|p361|Which is where we come in.
p361_306|p361|I do my job.
p361_312|p361|I knew him well.
p361_299|p361|Again, there was no detail.
p361_272|p361|So what is the secret of the success?
p361_266|p361|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p361_058|p361|This resulted in the following.
p361_070|p361|We have a strong team at the moment.
p361_064|p361|But the law is very clear on this.
p361_065|p361|I thought it was quite a positive result.
p361_071|p361|This is a dream come true.
p361_059|p361|I want to deal with this stuff.
p361_267|p361|It is difficult to say.
p361_273|p361|My husband was fighting for his life.
p361_298|p361|If we don't do it, someone else will.
p361_313|p361|I am not ready to walk away.
p361_307|p361|They have to get that sorted.
p361_111|p361|I'm not looking forward to it.
p361_105|p361|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
p361_139|p361|It has to find out what went wrong.
p361_101|p361|He knows he is good.
p361_115|p361|This could easily have been another tragedy.
p361_129|p361|How do you take them away?
p361_303|p361|Is it worth it?
p361_317|p361|The concerns were unfounded.
p361_288|p361|I did not think it was very proper.
p361_277|p361|We are in this for the long haul.
p361_263|p361|Do something that we need.
p361_075|p361|They were looking for things.
p361_061|p361|As good as they come.
p361_049|p361|I am the fastest player on the course.
p361_048|p361|It is all starting to come together.
p361_060|p361|We will be patient but we will win.
p361_074|p361|They said there was nothing.
p361_262|p361|It's been very difficult.
p361_276|p361|That is one point of view.
p361_289|p361|I have really noticed that this week.
p361_316|p361|I'd never given up on myself.
p361_302|p361|It should be easy.
p361_128|p361|We've always had something to do.
p361_114|p361|They have to tell it as it is.
p361_100|p361|What has changed since then?
p361_116|p361|You should enjoy the day.
p361_102|p361|I welcome the decision.
p361_314|p361|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p361_300|p361|Let the voters decide.
p361_328|p361|It's all about unfinished business.
p361_260|p361|Was he confident about his prospects?
p361_274|p361|So was the first half.
p361_248|p361|However we must not be complacent.
p361_089|p361|We all want to be left alone.
p361_062|p361|It is not for me to say.
p361_076|p361|I've got to be better than that   Quite.
p361_077|p361|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p361_063|p361|For that much we must be grateful.
p361_088|p361|It's just a failing service.
p361_249|p361|And that was just the start.
p361_275|p361|It is still under discussion with the board.
p361_261|p361|What can you do?
p361_329|p361|Our own people are coming over on Friday.
p361_301|p361|Then it will come.
p361_315|p361|They are already there.
p361_103|p361|It could take some time.
p361_117|p361|He was taken ill in his office.
p361_158|p361|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p361_170|p361|There is no signature.
p361_164|p361|And so did the rest of her team.
p361_399|p361|This idea is a good starting point.
p361_372|p361|It is very funny.
p361_414|p361|I am still waiting for a reply.
p361_400|p361|She had denied the charge.
p361_366|p361|And that was just about that.
p361_206|p361|We will be working on that this week, all right.
p361_212|p361|I am a socialist.
p361_038|p361|And this was well known?
p361_004|p361|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p361_010|p361|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p361_011|p361|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p361_005|p361|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p361_039|p361|It took two minutes to respond.
p361_213|p361|The response was really good.
p361_207|p361|These are serious matters.
p361_401|p361|It was cynical and callous.
p361_367|p361|By hard work, is the answer.
p361_373|p361|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p361_415|p361|We told them in July.
p361_398|p361|I am delighted to have her back home.
p361_165|p361|He tells the truth and that's important.
p361_171|p361|We can't go on like this.
p361_159|p361|It's a mixture of everything.
p361_198|p361|It was just a feeling.
p361_167|p361|The omens are not good.
p361_173|p361|Can he do it?
p361_359|p361|So far, it is no more.
p361_365|p361|I don't think so.
p361_403|p361|What sort of man is that?
p361_417|p361|We are very, very confident.
p361_371|p361|Well, you don't have time.
p361_239|p361|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p361_211|p361|It is his script.
p361_205|p361|Translation - we got it wrong.
p361_013|p361|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p361_007|p361|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p361_006|p361|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p361_012|p361|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p361_204|p361|I am prepared to step down.
p361_210|p361|Their loss is heartbreaking.
p361_238|p361|Neil is never going to come back.
p361_416|p361|This was a very tragic accident.
p361_370|p361|They haven't got the uniform.
p361_364|p361|It's going to happen.
p361_402|p361|It's a dead end.
p361_358|p361|If only it had been.
p361_172|p361|It is a very demanding course.
p361_166|p361|Those are difficult decisions.
p361_199|p361|People are trying to run away.
p361_189|p361|Now he is back on top again.
p361_162|p361|This means a lot of hard decisions.
p361_176|p361|If they wish to go, they can go.
p361_406|p361|It is truly masterly performance.
p361_360|p361|Seven people were critically injured.
p361_374|p361|This is good news for the industry.
p361_412|p361|He is very sensitive.
p361_348|p361|And that was the real problem.
p361_214|p361|The squad is too small.
p361_200|p361|On the face of it, this is excellent news.
p361_228|p361|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p361_016|p361|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p361_002|p361|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p361_003|p361|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p361_017|p361|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p361_229|p361|I just want him to win a tournament.
p361_201|p361|This is clearly not abuse.
p361_215|p361|You can blame the defence.
p361_349|p361|But then the problems began.
p361_375|p361|There are no quick fixes.
p361_413|p361|That can benefit the larger companies.
p361_407|p361|She failed to win any of them.
p361_361|p361|I am very sorry to be here.
p361_177|p361|However, it was a different story in the final.
p361_163|p361|That comes at a cost.
p361_188|p361|This is positive and welcome.
p361_175|p361|I've won the British.
p361_161|p361|You can see the appeal of running away.
p361_149|p361|There are no second chances.
p361_388|p361|Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
p361_411|p361|I found that we couldn't.
p361_377|p361|What do we have to do?
p361_363|p361|It was up to him.
p361_405|p361|We are going nowhere.
p361_203|p361|Everyone knew the family.
p361_217|p361|It just could be a good night.
p361_001|p361|Please call Stella.
p361_015|p361|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p361_029|p361|The results were very clear.
p361_028|p361|These decisions are not simple.
p361_014|p361|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p361_216|p361|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
p361_202|p361|He should be careful.
p361_362|p361|He could have given them a lot.
p361_404|p361|The message was clear.
p361_410|p361|It has a rally instead of a conference.
p361_376|p361|Because they didn't want to know.
p361_389|p361|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p361_148|p361|Or someone wants to say something different.
p361_160|p361|That is the sensible outcome.
p361_174|p361|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p361_192|p361|Failure is not an option.
p361_186|p361|It was a bit of a shock.
p361_179|p361|They get money for it now.
p361_151|p361|I am extremely sad.
p361_145|p361|She has never mentioned it.
p361_390|p361|It is planned for London in the spring.
p361_384|p361|We want this place to work.
p361_409|p361|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p361_353|p361|That there would be discussions.
p361_421|p361|My life is going to go on.
p361_347|p361|This is still happening in the US.
p361_227|p361|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p361_233|p361|But it is being pursued.
p361_019|p361|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p361_025|p361|Something has to be done.
p361_031|p361|I decided it is going to be William.
p361_030|p361|We must convince the citizens.
p361_024|p361|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p361_018|p361|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p361_232|p361|I will never see my son again.
p361_226|p361|Part-time staff are being laid off.
p361_420|p361|We certainly do not intend to disband.
p361_346|p361|It was his own decision.
p361_352|p361|The duties are still to be drawn up.
p361_408|p361|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p361_385|p361|Father is on the train.
p361_391|p361|Everything is coming together well.
p361_144|p361|It was a big departure.
p361_150|p361|And it was great for me.
p361_178|p361|I was just aghast.
p361_187|p361|It's not long enough.
p361_193|p361|That is clearly not happening fast enough.
p361_185|p361|We want to be part of it.
p361_191|p361|Anything less will not do.
p361_146|p361|I want my mum.
p361_152|p361|This series is for real.
p361_387|p361|We have been going for three years.
p361_393|p361|But we are not afraid of them.
p361_378|p361|I have never seen anything like it.
p361_344|p361|You've got to hand it to them.
p361_422|p361|It's really part of our mission.
p361_350|p361|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p361_218|p361|But we were wrong.
p361_230|p361|Eight others are also believed to have died.
p361_224|p361|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
p361_032|p361|But we need to keep it there.
p361_026|p361|That is where the damage has been done.
p361_027|p361|He may not need to force that message.
p361_033|p361|It is a case of taking a risk.
p361_225|p361|I don't know the full story.
p361_231|p361|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p361_219|p361|This has gone on too long.
p361_351|p361|From the opening Could It Be Magic?
p361_345|p361|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
p361_423|p361|That was only the start.
p361_379|p361|It's about New Yorkers.
p361_392|p361|They would have to go to the Royal.
p361_386|p361|It could have been prevented.
p361_153|p361|It has still to be recovered.
p361_147|p361|It seems to have been an own goal.
p361_190|p361|Actors like to be in the centre.
p361_184|p361|There was nothing she could do.
p361_180|p361|I could have been offended.
p361_194|p361|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p361_143|p361|They received no money under the merger.
p361_157|p361|Something has to be put in place.
p361_382|p361|He certainly would have approved.
p361_396|p361|They thought they couldn't get any.
p361_341|p361|And we are doing it.
p361_355|p361|That would be unsafe.
p361_369|p361|This is a major step forward.
p361_235|p361|That would end it for us.
p361_221|p361|It is a performance.
p361_209|p361|She has always been very friendly.
p361_037|p361|This decision is folly.
p361_023|p361|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p361_022|p361|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p361_036|p361|We felt it was sufficient.
p361_208|p361|The pace is telling.
p361_220|p361|It is an outrage.
p361_234|p361|He knew they were there.
p361_368|p361|It is really special to me.
p361_354|p361|It must not happen.
p361_340|p361|They are used to it.
p361_397|p361|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p361_383|p361|Conditions were less than ideal.
p361_156|p361|The driver just insulted me.
p361_142|p361|Until you hit the big games.
p361_195|p361|You look at that.
p361_181|p361|That's not the way to think.
p361_197|p361|It has been well worth it.
p361_183|p361|Then everyone must consider their future.
p361_154|p361|The conclusion is the same.
p361_140|p361|Only one was from Glasgow.
p361_168|p361|The game was there to be won.
p361_395|p361|That will be the criteria for the future.
p361_381|p361|They will give it a couple of years.
p361_356|p361|I did not go looking anywhere else.
p361_342|p361|It's just not good enough.
p361_424|p361|But what took them so long?
p361_418|p361|It is a result we should savour.
p361_222|p361|It is the best place.
p361_236|p361|We didn't and it cost us the game.
p361_020|p361|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p361_034|p361|I am really ready for it now.
p361_008|p361|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p361_009|p361|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p361_035|p361|He was jailed for four years.
p361_021|p361|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p361_237|p361|It attracted no complaints.
p361_223|p361|We tried to get them down.
p361_419|p361|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p361_343|p361|I have a cold.
p361_357|p361|We had no idea what was going on.
p361_380|p361|That was a real challenge.
p361_394|p361|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p361_169|p361|Then there's the casting.
p361_141|p361|I'm sure he will be aware of it.
p361_155|p361|I wish they would commit to us.
p361_182|p361|I can see it now.
p361_196|p361|They will be very physical.
p361_132|p361|That got me out.
p361_126|p361|He has gone through the process before.
p361_318|p361|It doesn't look good for her.
p361_330|p361|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
p361_324|p361|We are very proud of him.
p361_287|p361|His remarks were disgraceful.
p361_293|p361|Well, that's all right then.
p361_278|p361|Here we go then.
p361_244|p361|Sadly it is a mess.
p361_250|p361|Nothing was meant by it.
p361_085|p361|And we have a singer.
p361_091|p361|Where are they?
p361_046|p361|The answer was wrong.
p361_052|p361|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p361_053|p361|It is an important step forward.
p361_047|p361|They need to be helped.
p361_090|p361|I was saying, No.
p361_084|p361|Drama is not one of them.
p361_251|p361|That was my last game.
p361_245|p361|That has to take its toll.
p361_279|p361|No reason was given.
p361_292|p361|It was considered to be topical.
p361_286|p361|And she is very clear on this.
p361_325|p361|There they were, making excuses for him.
p361_331|p361|It will be fine.
p361_319|p361|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p361_127|p361|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p361_133|p361|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p361_119|p361|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
p361_125|p361|And if they fail?
p361_131|p361|A kind of effective treatment would be welcomed.
p361_327|p361|Every case is completely different.
p361_333|p361|He has a point.
p361_290|p361|In a way he was.
p361_284|p361|We have been here before.
p361_253|p361|It is not just the agencies.
p361_247|p361|But those days are dead and gone.
p361_092|p361|I am delighted to hear this news.
p361_086|p361|It was exactly four months away.
p361_079|p361|We have never been short of volunteers.
p361_051|p361|They were taken to prove a point.
p361_045|p361|He was found again almost a year later.
p361_044|p361|I'm sure he does.
p361_050|p361|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p361_078|p361|As it should be.
p361_087|p361|This is a personal decision for me.
p361_093|p361|I knew him a little.
p361_246|p361|We want to see the maximum of change.
p361_252|p361|Colour is another problem.
p361_285|p361|And he did that.
p361_291|p361|I will never forget that.
p361_332|p361|Yet the job is far from over.
p361_326|p361|It just got out of control.
p361_130|p361|It will be released in October.
p361_124|p361|I didn't think about it again.
p361_118|p361|We couldn't get enough of it.
p361_120|p361|I am not very pleased.
p361_134|p361|It's a matter for the Committee.
p361_108|p361|The results are very positive.
p361_322|p361|There was nowhere for him to go.
p361_336|p361|When you think you cannot go on, you can.
p361_295|p361|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p361_281|p361|I am really sorry that he is going.
p361_256|p361|They seem to be, anyway.
p361_242|p361|It's to do with this place.
p361_097|p361|You didn't get a modified.
p361_083|p361|It just isn't there.
p361_054|p361|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p361_040|p361|Why you did it will never be known.
p361_068|p361|We are not going to back off.
p361_069|p361|He said it was for sale.
p361_041|p361|He was in his element.
p361_055|p361|And they removed a Borderer.
p361_082|p361|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361_096|p361|Nobody called me to explain.
p361_243|p361|It's a technical demand.
p361_257|p361|I thought they were just excited.
p361_280|p361|I can't wait for it to come out.
p361_294|p361|No-one is a winner in this.
p361_337|p361|What a difference a game can make.
p361_323|p361|Not that he was complaining.
p361_109|p361|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p361_135|p361|It will have to ratify the deal.
p361_121|p361|It is just a statement of fact.
p361_137|p361|It was highly successful.
p361_123|p361|I will just have to be patient.
p361_335|p361|It is our other home.
p361_321|p361|You have to be realistic.
p361_309|p361|Does it make a profit?
p361_282|p361|Indeed, that has already begun.
p361_296|p361|What do you think?
p361_241|p361|He was also very happy to listen.
p361_255|p361|You don't see that.
p361_269|p361|We call it marriage.
p361_080|p361|But who is it?
p361_094|p361|They just have a go.
p361_043|p361|So, we have to go back.
p361_057|p361|That was something else.
p361_056|p361|That is the way it is.
p361_042|p361|That means an extra two years.
p361_095|p361|If it's going in, it goes in.
p361_081|p361|Kenny Miller might come through.
p361_268|p361|He is not the only one.
p361_254|p361|It came in bits and pieces.
p361_240|p361|Four of the victims were women.
p361_297|p361|They went back to the seventeenth.
p361_283|p361|But it's the truth.
p361_308|p361|That is a dangerous assumption.
p361_320|p361|I have some comments.
p361_334|p361|He should emerge as the winner.
p361_122|p361|It was on my mind a little bit.
p361_136|p361|I've never seen anything like it.
s5_048|s5|I can live here without a problem.
s5_289|s5|Is it in the right place?
s5_262|s5|They had asked not to be named.
s5_276|s5|The strong performance is expected to continue.
s5_316|s5|The future might well be green after all.
s5_302|s5|I would not want to be famous for nothing.
s5_114|s5|The balance comes from the five enterprise bodies involved.
s5_100|s5|It's hardly a new strategy in art practice.
s5_128|s5|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
s5_129|s5|We have never been paid that money.
s5_101|s5|Some young girls also came by last night.
s5_115|s5|The potential is always in the idea.
s5_303|s5|The Russian described his defeat as a bad day at the office.
s5_317|s5|The package of measures and extra cash are a major step forward.
s5_277|s5|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
s5_263|s5|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
s5_288|s5|Do I think about them often?
s5_049|s5|The full price was accepted by them.
s5_075|s5|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
s5_061|s5|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
s5_088|s5|There is no issue of national security involved here.
s5_077|s5|So is that it, then?
s5_063|s5|It had little effect on European equity markets.
s5_275|s5|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
s5_261|s5|Even if it did, my views wouldn't change.
s5_249|s5|However, Hamilton had a different version of events.
s5_301|s5|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
s5_315|s5|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
s5_329|s5|Did it work?
s5_103|s5|The idea is the shop within a shop.
s5_117|s5|Six public bodies are behind the plan.
s5_116|s5|That is the only way to rate players.
s5_102|s5|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
s5_328|s5|His style was direct and very human.
s5_314|s5|Put another way, they just won't do it.
s5_300|s5|We still think this trade is on the increase.
s5_248|s5|Private sector pay awards were a major factor.
s5_260|s5|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
s5_274|s5|The agreement remains the only show in town.
s5_062|s5|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
s5_076|s5|How are you, sir?
s5_089|s5|Offers of company cars and other benefits have also become quite common.
s5_099|s5|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
s5_072|s5|The management team has a hard task ahead.
s5_066|s5|The group is currently working to create several substantial new funds.
s5_258|s5|I've had to take time off work today.
s5_270|s5|He was right into football from an early age.
s5_264|s5|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
s5_338|s5|I am confident that the estate workers will have a secure future.
s5_304|s5|Mitchell hit a post from a penalty in front.
s5_310|s5|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
s5_106|s5|Britain will lead demands for the reform of Europe.
s5_112|s5|We control every part of your life.
s5_113|s5|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
s5_107|s5|I felt my father was very hard.
s5_311|s5|They bought the property four years ago.
s5_305|s5|I try to be open to experience.
s5_339|s5|We believe a third party was involved.
s5_265|s5|It's about time something was done about equipment.
s5_271|s5|He remains a main board director of Royal.
s5_259|s5|I enjoyed this summer, which is a big difference from last year.
s5_067|s5|We're moving from four companies into a single company.
s5_073|s5|They had been in Scotland on exercise.
s5_098|s5|They are a different team at home.
s5_059|s5|For a decade she was proved right.
s5_065|s5|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
s5_071|s5|It's been a great evening for us.
s5_298|s5|Consumers have generally accepted this process to date.
s5_267|s5|But I was not up for the title.
s5_273|s5|They first met during a Step in London.
s5_313|s5|I was better prepared than a year ago.
s5_307|s5|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
s5_139|s5|We're currently looking at the level of support.
s5_111|s5|We backed away from writing new songs.
s5_105|s5|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
s5_104|s5|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
s5_110|s5|I think there's not much between them.
s5_138|s5|But it looks good for next year.
s5_306|s5|Or we could do a trade sale.
s5_312|s5|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
s5_272|s5|The only plus point is the reduction in crime.
s5_266|s5|He did not provide us with a proposal.
s5_299|s5|But the next day she paid for it.
s5_070|s5|I do not attempt to answer that.
s5_064|s5|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
s5_058|s5|He will just go on doing his job.
s5_003|s5|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
s5_017|s5|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
s5_201|s5|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
s5_215|s5|If not, a deal could take many months.
s5_229|s5|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
s5_375|s5|They would have to go to the Royal.
s5_361|s5|Life will not be all work, however.
s5_349|s5|Local and national phone calls will be free.
s5_188|s5|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
s5_177|s5|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
s5_163|s5|South Africa is the next likely customer.
s5_162|s5|I told them during their morning break.
s5_176|s5|You can see the damage that has been done.
s5_189|s5|Clubs need to have their own drug abuse policies.
s5_348|s5|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.
s5_360|s5|Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the American university, confirmed the appointment yesterday.
s5_374|s5|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
s5_228|s5|We have to look towards next season.
s5_214|s5|It is not a natural choice for them.
s5_200|s5|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
s5_016|s5|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
s5_002|s5|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
s5_014|s5|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
s5_028|s5|On his first public appearance, Mr Cameron found himself under fire.
s5_216|s5|It would not have thought otherwise for one moment.
s5_202|s5|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
s5_389|s5|Is it worth it?
s5_362|s5|My tax affairs have been totally open.
s5_376|s5|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
s5_160|s5|We have never met a previous Prime Minister.
s5_174|s5|No, is the answer to your first question.
s5_148|s5|That will reduce my chance of selection.
s5_149|s5|Surely it can't run for two years.
s5_175|s5|I'm just as concerned about life and death as you are.
s5_161|s5|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
s5_377|s5|My wife and family are the support system.
s5_363|s5|Five years ago its return was rejected.
s5_388|s5|What do they want us to do?
s5_203|s5|I think every coach wants to work daily.
s5_217|s5|We've had five weeks with two games really.
s5_029|s5|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
s5_001|s5|Please call Stella.  
s5_015|s5|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
s5_039|s5|I wish I could see it again.
s5_011|s5|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
s5_005|s5|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
s5_213|s5|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
s5_207|s5|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
s5_398|s5|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
s5_367|s5|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
s5_373|s5|The play was to go straight ahead.
s5_159|s5|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
s5_165|s5|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
s5_171|s5|I was told that I've set that new club scoring record.
s5_170|s5|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
s5_164|s5|Nato has left them with no other option.
s5_158|s5|The property has been for sale for several months.
s5_372|s5|The two cases are about exactly the same thing.
s5_366|s5|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
s5_400|s5|I saw one man vote five times.
s5_399|s5|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
s5_206|s5|A European final must be the millennium target.
s5_212|s5|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
s5_004|s5|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
s5_010|s5|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
s5_038|s5|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
s5_006|s5|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
s5_012|s5|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
s5_238|s5|He is not quite as confident as he appears.
s5_204|s5|I do not see this so much as failure.
s5_210|s5|We are still seeking that complete performance.
s5_358|s5|In football terms, though, Kilmarnock are well in the black.
s5_370|s5|Most of the affected jobs are in the US.
s5_364|s5|We are keen to see truth and justice.
s5_199|s5|It comes down to the police in England.
s5_172|s5|There is no doubt there's room for us.
s5_166|s5|But, overall, Aberdeen looks well placed for growth.
s5_167|s5|The site was launched in the UK on Monday.
s5_173|s5|A great player has to win major championships.
s5_198|s5|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
s5_365|s5|The Farmer is doing the whole of August.
s5_371|s5|None of the fire has been lost.
s5_359|s5|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
s5_211|s5|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
s5_205|s5|The hotel has a long and happy history.
s5_239|s5|What do we want to do that for?
s5_013|s5|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
s5_007|s5|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
s5_022|s5|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
s5_036|s5|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
s5_220|s5|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
s5_234|s5|There was no plan B if the Good Friday Agreement failed, he warned.
s5_208|s5|An English Parliament was never a serious option.
s5_397|s5|New York provided little help for the London market.
s5_383|s5|Like some others, he is still to improve himself a lot.
s5_354|s5|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
s5_340|s5|That has been the story all through this season, really.
s5_368|s5|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
s5_195|s5|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
s5_181|s5|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
s5_156|s5|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
s5_142|s5|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
s5_143|s5|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
s5_157|s5|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
s5_180|s5|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.
s5_194|s5|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
s5_369|s5|These old songs are very nice to play.
s5_341|s5|The sale of Murray Johnstone should be completed early in the fourth quarter.
s5_355|s5|It's always a difficult game against England.
s5_382|s5|Jones said she was there to show my complete support for my husband.
s5_396|s5|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
s5_209|s5|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
s5_235|s5|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
s5_221|s5|This result has given me much food for thought.
s5_037|s5|He too started on the subs seats.
s5_023|s5|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
s5_035|s5|I got in with a bad crowd.
s5_021|s5|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
s5_009|s5|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
s5_237|s5|But the town has great potential as a book town.
s5_223|s5|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
s5_380|s5|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
s5_394|s5|This trial has brought the focus back on the inquiry.
s5_343|s5|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
s5_357|s5|Two goals in nine minutes wasn't bad.
s5_182|s5|They were mainly very positive about the role.
s5_196|s5|I had several words with the fourth official and was warned.
s5_141|s5|Getting Kilmarnock so early in the Scottish season could give us a chance.
s5_155|s5|He said some things which were better left alone.
s5_169|s5|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
s5_168|s5|He's a man who knows all about forward thinking.
s5_154|s5|We are too easily beaten as a team.
s5_140|s5|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
s5_197|s5|Opera must get its house in order
s5_183|s5|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
s5_356|s5|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
s5_342|s5|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
s5_395|s5|That had happened long before half-time yesterday.
s5_381|s5|They wanted them to move fast, but some couldn't.
s5_222|s5|It is vital that the government gets this right.
s5_236|s5|His home is provided by the government.
s5_008|s5|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
s5_020|s5|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
s5_034|s5|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
s5_018|s5|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
s5_030|s5|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
s5_024|s5|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
s5_232|s5|I'd rather play well next week than here.
s5_226|s5|People like him give rugby a good name.
s5_385|s5|Lead feet were the order of the day.
s5_391|s5|How do you take them away?
s5_346|s5|Perhaps we should learn something from them.
s5_352|s5|Neither issued any statement after the hearing.
s5_187|s5|This will take in dividend policy and capital structure.
s5_193|s5|I expect to see a different Kilmarnock side tomorrow.
s5_178|s5|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
s5_144|s5|It was also live on Radio Five.
s5_150|s5|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
s5_151|s5|So on the stadium front, I think we have made our case.
s5_145|s5|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
s5_179|s5|Glasgow has continued to run it on an agency basis.
s5_192|s5|Full details are expected to be released in June.
s5_186|s5|But I hope the referee can now go back on his decision.
s5_353|s5|And so it is with young companies.
s5_347|s5|Stewart ruled out a return of this cash to shareholders, however.
s5_390|s5|Does it matter?
s5_384|s5|It was the September weekend after all.
s5_227|s5|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
s5_233|s5|I know that you have a love of Scotland.
s5_025|s5|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
s5_031|s5|It is about control of our economy.
s5_019|s5|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
s5_027|s5|He does not even trust his own members.
s5_033|s5|He added that her comments were noted.
s5_225|s5|It is my decision and my decision alone.
s5_231|s5|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
s5_392|s5|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
s5_386|s5|So what happens next?
s5_379|s5|But the German product failed safety tests.
s5_351|s5|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
s5_345|s5|In fact, he is very much a Kilmarnock man.
s5_190|s5|In this position, it often takes some time.
s5_184|s5|You were made to feel so welcome.
s5_153|s5|That is a big risk at any price.
s5_147|s5|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
s5_146|s5|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
s5_152|s5|We had to work very hard for our points.
s5_185|s5|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
s5_191|s5|I've never had a year like this.
s5_344|s5|This may help in the short term but not beyond March.
s5_350|s5|My views on the decision are well known.
s5_378|s5|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
s5_387|s5|Had this been common practice?
s5_393|s5|After the match, do you?
s5_230|s5|I think he's the favourite, no question.
s5_224|s5|The labour side has developed in the North area.
s5_218|s5|But not every story is a success story.
s5_032|s5|I feel I did not have enough time.
s5_026|s5|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
s5_082|s5|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
s5_096|s5|I bought a flat six years ago.
s5_041|s5|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
s5_055|s5|I said My brother, George, never saw that.
s5_069|s5|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
s5_280|s5|He could understand both points of view.
s5_294|s5|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.
s5_243|s5|It is just a tax on employment.
s5_257|s5|It's just that we see different things.
s5_337|s5|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
s5_323|s5|We even changed the system three times but it didn't help.
s5_135|s5|Are you going to win?
s5_121|s5|There is no future in rock music.
s5_109|s5|I think we can cause a surprise in the first division.
s5_108|s5|Once again a strong services performance helped the overall trading position.
s5_120|s5|There were no reports of any injuries.
s5_134|s5|What happened in that game?
s5_322|s5|Friday night was a pretty good night.
s5_336|s5|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
s5_256|s5|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
s5_242|s5|What are you not good at ?
s5_295|s5|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
s5_281|s5|I was independent but I am not now.
s5_068|s5|It is too much to take in.
s5_054|s5|However, a year ago things looked so different.
s5_040|s5|I am secure in my own position.
s5_097|s5|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
s5_083|s5|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
s5_095|s5|Woods is not just in control of his golf game.
s5_081|s5|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
s5_056|s5|At the present moment, she will stay.
s5_042|s5|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
s5_297|s5|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
s5_283|s5|Larsson is clearly the form player just now.
s5_254|s5|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
s5_240|s5|Does the name matter ?
s5_268|s5|His own boys say the same about him.
s5_320|s5|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
s5_334|s5|Are they free?
s5_308|s5|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
s5_122|s5|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
s5_136|s5|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
s5_137|s5|It is a dangerous trip to make for these people.
s5_123|s5|Now the system is right behind us.
s5_309|s5|Their job is to show whether any disease remains.
s5_335|s5|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
s5_321|s5|In short, he is the wrong candidate, but the right man.
s5_269|s5|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
s5_241|s5|how do you get it back ?
s5_255|s5|But I'm a lot of other things, too.
s5_282|s5|It had happened on average once a week this year.
s5_296|s5|Some analysts said a share split seemed likely.
s5_043|s5|For career reasons, too, he believed he needed to come home.
s5_057|s5|First Choice is the clear leader in terms of performance.
s5_080|s5|Why do it otherwise?
s5_094|s5|We were under a bit of pressure.
s5_090|s5|It is a great feeling right now.
s5_084|s5|Campbell said he hoped to build on that fighting spirit against Hearts.
s5_053|s5|But you have to give credit to Dunfermline.
s5_047|s5|Talks have continued at many different levels.
s5_292|s5|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
s5_286|s5|was everything done to save people?
s5_279|s5|I am convinced that this is a subject which can make a difference.
s5_251|s5|He was failed by his health authority.
s5_245|s5|A Home Office spokeswoman said she was unable to comment on individual cases.
s5_319|s5|We can get back on track with that.
s5_325|s5|People are determined to get it right.
s5_331|s5|Is our children learning?
s5_127|s5|I am not under any new pressure.
s5_133|s5|Are you from the rugby?
s5_132|s5|So what is the campaign about?
s5_126|s5|In our view the stock has financial risk.
s5_330|s5|Do you think we are a top nation?
s5_324|s5|People have a wish to charge twice.
s5_318|s5|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
s5_244|s5|Overall, though, it was an easy Sunday afternoon for Kilmarnock.
s5_250|s5|Its primary business channel is the internet.
s5_278|s5|It is based on population rather than need.
s5_287|s5|What was the matter for concern?
s5_293|s5|The group has been hit hard by security operations in Ireland.
s5_046|s5|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
s5_085|s5|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
s5_091|s5|It is no longer the white death.
s5_087|s5|Tony Blair is taking a computer course.
s5_093|s5|It's allowed in the rules he said later.
s5_078|s5|Do I have a favourite?
s5_044|s5|He did very well, but didn't win.
s5_050|s5|When you do you will never want to do any other job.
s5_285|s5|And they were being paid?
s5_291|s5|If he could have taken those words back, he would have.
s5_246|s5|We are delighted  nothing else, just delighted.
s5_252|s5|Is there a waiting list?
s5_332|s5|How independent is that?
s5_326|s5|We are putting in place training programmes to improve skills.
s5_118|s5|We have to offer value for money.
s5_130|s5|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
s5_124|s5|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
s5_125|s5|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
s5_131|s5|So, did she meet him?
s5_119|s5|It has too few of its own special forces inside Kosovo.
s5_327|s5|You get better at putting on a face for the world.
s5_333|s5|What form did that take?
s5_253|s5|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
s5_247|s5|We will be taking a world lead.
s5_290|s5|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
s5_284|s5|For that reason cover should not be given.
s5_051|s5|There is still the question of his health.
s5_045|s5|They seem too much of a sure thing.
s5_079|s5|What do we do?
s5_092|s5|When I went down I knew it was bad.
s5_086|s5|The campaign ran in Lothian, Fife and Central Scotland police areas.
p333_034|p333|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p333_222|p333|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p333_236|p333|It is a big time for me.
p333_395|p333|There is no margin for error.
p333_381|p333|There are moments of honesty, too.
p333_418|p333|I'd just like to play.
p333_356|p333|Which he can do.
p333_424|p333|Appointed general secretary last September.
p333_342|p333|So, how will it be received in the US?
p333_197|p333|I didn't play well last year.
p333_183|p333|The same goes for personnel.
p333_168|p333|They got the job done.
p333_154|p333|She is a valuable member of the Government.
p333_140|p333|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p333_141|p333|The post will run for four years.
p333_155|p333|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p333_169|p333|They tried to give her advice.
p333_182|p333|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p333_196|p333|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p333_343|p333|He was different from the rest of us.
p333_357|p333|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p333_419|p333|They were in good humour, too.
p333_380|p333|All of the names are familiar to me.
p333_394|p333|If not, he should go home.
p333_237|p333|There were two things going on at once.
p333_223|p333|Two and a half million people have died.
p333_035|p333|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p333_021|p333|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p333_009|p333|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p333_037|p333|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p333_023|p333|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p333_209|p333|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p333_235|p333|What's it all about?
p333_221|p333|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p333_382|p333|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p333_396|p333|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p333_369|p333|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p333_341|p333|Cinema is a communal experience.
p333_355|p333|We have obviously got some work to do.
p333_180|p333|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p333_194|p333|There was an element of jealousy.
p333_143|p333|He had reason to be pleased.
p333_157|p333|But he is not using them.
p333_156|p333|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p333_142|p333|However, it's good to turn the page.
p333_195|p333|There was no happy ending.
p333_181|p333|We might be back next year.
p333_354|p333|Smith has not let him down.
p333_340|p333|The stadium was full.
p333_368|p333|They should feel ashamed.
p333_397|p333|I get very excited by that.
p333_383|p333|Is that where we are?
p333_220|p333|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p333_234|p333|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p333_208|p333|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p333_022|p333|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p333_036|p333|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p333_032|p333|There are moments of silence.
p333_026|p333|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p333_230|p333|She will also get a pay rise.
p333_224|p333|It could not be too high.
p333_218|p333|Or some thought that they have.
p333_387|p333|There was no energy behind it.
p333_393|p333|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p333_422|p333|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p333_344|p333|His name is Michael Owen.
p333_350|p333|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p333_378|p333|It's not just for classical music.
p333_185|p333|This area is perfect for children.
p333_191|p333|When he took over it really took off.
p333_146|p333|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p333_152|p333|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p333_153|p333|I will certainly be having words with him.
p333_147|p333|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p333_190|p333|The weekly average was three hours.
p333_184|p333|In a way he was.
p333_379|p333|This must be kept in total perspective.
p333_351|p333|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p333_423|p333|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p333_345|p333|He's got a great chance of making it.
p333_392|p333|It is not a wish list.
p333_386|p333|But there's no eye contact.
p333_219|p333|If only we had known.
p333_225|p333|How many cases have there been?
p333_231|p333|It's because they can't understand the language.
p333_027|p333|But who shot the president?
p333_033|p333|So now this series has had its day.
p333_025|p333|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p333_031|p333|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p333_019|p333|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p333_227|p333|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p333_233|p333|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p333_390|p333|We have chosen for the patients.
p333_384|p333|We used to keep our business rates.
p333_353|p333|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p333_347|p333|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p333_421|p333|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p333_409|p333|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p333_192|p333|I have been very nervous.
p333_186|p333|No, they have not.
p333_151|p333|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p333_145|p333|That is impressive by any standards.
p333_179|p333|It is a job creation scheme.
p333_178|p333|I didn't mean to kill her.
p333_144|p333|It was important to win the singles.
p333_150|p333|The Scots are great.
p333_187|p333|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p333_193|p333|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p333_408|p333|There's nothing for you here.
p333_346|p333|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p333_420|p333|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p333_352|p333|The feeling is awesome.
p333_385|p333|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p333_391|p333|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p333_232|p333|It is time for a more honest approach.
p333_226|p333|I hope they understand that.
p333_018|p333|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p333_030|p333|All would be under threat.
p333_024|p333|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p333_080|p333|But the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_094|p333|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p333_043|p333|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p333_057|p333|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p333_282|p333|It was indeed a night to remember.
p333_296|p333|That sort of thing is long gone.
p333_269|p333|It was very frightened and dirty.
p333_241|p333|That is the key message.
p333_255|p333|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p333_309|p333|Was that not awful?
p333_335|p333|Eleven events are required.
p333_321|p333|We are worried about casualties.
p333_137|p333|All the people thought that he would die.
p333_123|p333|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p333_122|p333|A venue was found.
p333_136|p333|YOU thought it was a headache.
p333_320|p333|We will just get on with it.
p333_334|p333|He came in an army uniform.
p333_308|p333|I think that could work to our advantage.
p333_254|p333|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p333_240|p333|We are all equal.
p333_268|p333|It had been in place since last July.
p333_297|p333|And sooner than we may think.
p333_283|p333|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333_056|p333|The performance was excellent.
p333_042|p333|We've tried every other way.
p333_095|p333|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p333_081|p333|They wanted to show what they could do.
p333_097|p333|They didn't take you to mass graves.
p333_083|p333|All of us do.
p333_068|p333|John was a very nice man.
p333_054|p333|My parents are exhausted.
p333_040|p333|It is time for a new approach.
p333_295|p333|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
p333_281|p333|Arguably, they have already done it.
p333_256|p333|We started from scratch.
p333_242|p333|It ignores the future.
p333_322|p333|This is my music.
p333_336|p333|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p333_108|p333|Clark is back on top form.
p333_120|p333|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p333_134|p333|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p333_135|p333|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p333_121|p333|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p333_109|p333|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p333_337|p333|You encourage them - you can do it.
p333_323|p333|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333_243|p333|This is the subway.
p333_257|p333|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p333_280|p333|We know we can't rely on you.
p333_294|p333|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p333_041|p333|We have nothing to say about that.
p333_055|p333|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p333_069|p333|This is a big, big win.
p333_082|p333|It runs until the beginning of June.
p333_096|p333|He could face a jail sentence.
p333_092|p333|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p333_086|p333|That is in the public domain.
p333_051|p333|And does it even matter?
p333_045|p333|However, the report was incorrect.
p333_079|p333|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333_290|p333|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p333_284|p333|There is something in this.
p333_253|p333|We are still getting signals.
p333_247|p333|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p333_327|p333|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p333_333|p333|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p333_125|p333|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p333_131|p333|I have been coming here for nine years.
p333_119|p333|We must improve our relations with government.
p333_118|p333|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p333_130|p333|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p333_124|p333|He said it was the worst possible result.
p333_332|p333|That is as it may be.
p333_326|p333|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p333_246|p333|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333_252|p333|Who will provide the wine?
p333_285|p333|I could feel the blood on my face.
p333_291|p333|It is just too long since the war.
p333_078|p333|I think we will join the single currency.
p333_044|p333|Nobody else was with me.
p333_050|p333|Everything was an effort.
p333_087|p333|The Hague is too good for him.
p333_093|p333|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p333_085|p333|It was different from our other work.
p333_091|p333|We are looking for volunteers.
p333_046|p333|It does make a big difference.
p333_052|p333|This is the same old story.
p333_287|p333|There are no plans to change this.
p333_293|p333|Debbie Harry was cool.
p333_244|p333|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p333_250|p333|There are two games to go after that.
p333_278|p333|You were the kidnappers.
p333_330|p333|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p333_324|p333|I haven't won the world title.
p333_318|p333|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p333_132|p333|It is just part of modern day life.
p333_126|p333|This is our way to make our point.
p333_127|p333|It was a disaster.
p333_133|p333|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p333_319|p333|I was doing well at the hustings.
p333_325|p333|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p333_331|p333|This Patton will also return.
p333_279|p333|It is a very interesting subject.
p333_251|p333|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p333_245|p333|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333_292|p333|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p333_286|p333|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p333_053|p333|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333_047|p333|Do not forget about Monaco.
p333_090|p333|It's a true story.
p333_084|p333|But will they fall in love?
p333_089|p333|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p333_062|p333|The chief constable is right.
p333_076|p333|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333_248|p333|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
p333_260|p333|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p333_274|p333|The whole region is in shock.
p333_328|p333|And now he tells us.
p333_300|p333|I know you went back this morning.
p333_116|p333|Henry was strong and talented.
p333_102|p333|We all thought we were going to die.
p333_103|p333|Maybe he will act again.
p333_117|p333|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p333_301|p333|I will carry on.
p333_315|p333|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p333_329|p333|I am not changing my event.
p333_275|p333|It was a journey into a new life.
p333_261|p333|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p333_249|p333|He's in with the furniture.
p333_077|p333|They had not been handcuffed.
p333_063|p333|I didn't expect to get one.
p333_088|p333|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p333_049|p333|You can't give in to the vandals.
p333_075|p333|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p333_061|p333|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_288|p333|It's too big a risk to take.
p333_277|p333|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p333_263|p333|I heard some of his remarks.
p333_303|p333|I made a mistake.
p333_317|p333|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p333_129|p333|He was back to square one.
p333_101|p333|Happily we found it in the library.
p333_115|p333|I thought he was terrific.
p333_114|p333|The days of empty promises are over.
p333_100|p333|Could they perhaps be related?
p333_128|p333|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p333_316|p333|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p333_302|p333|A review of the decision is being sought.
p333_262|p333|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p333_276|p333|It's a way of making a mark.
p333_289|p333|It's going to be quite a challenge.
p333_060|p333|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p333_074|p333|That would have killed the match.
p333_048|p333|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p333_070|p333|The crowd was awesome.
p333_064|p333|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p333_058|p333|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p333_299|p333|However, consumers may take a different view.
p333_272|p333|That's a very strong element.
p333_266|p333|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p333_306|p333|They certainly do not socialise.
p333_312|p333|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p333_104|p333|Safety was also an issue.
p333_110|p333|It needs somebody to give way.
p333_138|p333|It is never an easy game.
p333_139|p333|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p333_111|p333|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p333_105|p333|That's why he visited.
p333_313|p333|I'm not blaming audiences.
p333_307|p333|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p333_267|p333|I was just overwhelmed.
p333_273|p333|How much of a cop out is that?
p333_298|p333|Raised the way you want it.
p333_059|p333|It will come up here.
p333_065|p333|This is only the start of my season.
p333_071|p333|Every game against New Zealand is.
p333_098|p333|There was no option.
p333_067|p333|I've taken to the hills.
p333_073|p333|My game is in pretty good shape.
p333_265|p333|It has to be funded.
p333_271|p333|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p333_259|p333|You're not going to get hurt.
p333_311|p333|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p333_305|p333|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p333_339|p333|I always said No.
p333_113|p333|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p333_107|p333|There was nobody on the roof.
p333_106|p333|I know a lot of people who don't.
p333_112|p333|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p333_338|p333|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p333_304|p333|It is a very special city.
p333_310|p333|That was him under pressure.
p333_258|p333|There are a few changes.
p333_270|p333|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p333_264|p333|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333_072|p333|The jury is still out on this one.
p333_066|p333|It sounded awfully like panic.
p333_099|p333|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p333_001|p333|Please call Stella.
p333_015|p333|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333_203|p333|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p333_217|p333|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p333_388|p333|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p333_377|p333|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p333_411|p333|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p333_405|p333|They hold on for many years.
p333_363|p333|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p333_149|p333|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p333_175|p333|He just carried on filming.
p333_161|p333|It was a breathtaking moment.
p333_160|p333|We are not moving in.
p333_174|p333|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p333_148|p333|That alibi is now gone.
p333_404|p333|She said he showed no remorse.
p333_362|p333|They have two children.
p333_376|p333|You will not feel a thing.
p333_410|p333|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p333_389|p333|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p333_216|p333|It separates the men from the boys.
p333_202|p333|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333_014|p333|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333_028|p333|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p333_016|p333|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333_002|p333|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333_228|p333|But Annika is just amazing.
p333_200|p333|Now it has been eclipsed.
p333_348|p333|So now you know.
p333_360|p333|And we're talking Big Money.
p333_406|p333|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p333_412|p333|I have not come in to take over.
p333_374|p333|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p333_189|p333|I was chosen to do this.
p333_162|p333|That's been our position all along.
p333_176|p333|He will be judged by his actions.
p333_177|p333|I never found my rhythm.
p333_163|p333|I was in jail for five years.
p333_188|p333|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p333_413|p333|Is this accurate?
p333_375|p333|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p333_361|p333|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p333_407|p333|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
p333_349|p333|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p333_201|p333|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p333_215|p333|This is a foolish idea.
p333_229|p333|Our job is to change that.
p333_003|p333|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p333_017|p333|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333_013|p333|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333_007|p333|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333_211|p333|They must be kept on the ground.
p333_205|p333|It has come as a bombshell.
p333_239|p333|I want to play at the highest level.
p333_403|p333|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p333_365|p333|I'm really proud of my young players.
p333_371|p333|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p333_417|p333|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p333_359|p333|They were that poor.
p333_198|p333|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p333_167|p333|I am very, very happy.
p333_173|p333|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p333_172|p333|It's going to be epic.
p333_166|p333|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p333_199|p333|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p333_358|p333|It has been recorded twice.
p333_370|p333|Both managements are very supportive.
p333_416|p333|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p333_402|p333|There is a great potential on this river.
p333_364|p333|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p333_238|p333|It's something we want to make work.
p333_204|p333|It is legally binding.
p333_210|p333|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p333_006|p333|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p333_012|p333|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333_004|p333|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_010|p333|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p333_038|p333|Too many factors are now working against him.
p333_206|p333|Before the games it was pretty open.
p333_212|p333|We still don't know.
p333_399|p333|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p333_414|p333|A judicial review is also being considered.
p333_372|p333|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p333_366|p333|People buy everything with cash.
p333_400|p333|Which means it matters.
p333_170|p333|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p333_164|p333|There are no charges.
p333_158|p333|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p333_159|p333|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p333_165|p333|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p333_171|p333|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p333_367|p333|There was a great support all round the route.
p333_401|p333|I think it can count against you now.
p333_415|p333|I want to win this thing.
p333_373|p333|This is important for two reasons.
p333_398|p333|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p333_213|p333|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p333_207|p333|We didn't know he was even out.
p333_039|p333|His views are hardly surprising.
p333_011|p333|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p333_005|p333|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p334_289|p334|They married in August last year.
p334_048|p334|Times have changed, but have they improved?
p334_060|p334|Or so everyone believed.
p334_074|p334|It was very personal and very intimate.
p334_128|p334|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p334_114|p334|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p334_100|p334|Justice was not seen today.
p334_316|p334|There are two games to go after that.
p334_302|p334|I just need a bit of luck.
p334_303|p334|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
p334_317|p334|It seems a little short to me.
p334_101|p334|I would never even consider it.
p334_115|p334|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p334_129|p334|We are taking advice on this.
p334_075|p334|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334_061|p334|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p334_049|p334|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p334_288|p334|It's the taking part that counts.
p334_277|p334|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p334_263|p334|I would like Glasgow.
p334_249|p334|That's why they go to the opera.
p334_275|p334|We are on a four-year mission.
p334_261|p334|He was sentenced to seven years.
p334_077|p334|They follow him everywhere.
p334_063|p334|Tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_088|p334|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
p334_103|p334|We should just say no.
p334_117|p334|He told the conference.
p334_329|p334|I will be standing.
p334_301|p334|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p334_315|p334|The hotel was now for sale.
p334_314|p334|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p334_300|p334|It's a sign of the times.
p334_328|p334|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p334_116|p334|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p334_102|p334|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p334_089|p334|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334_062|p334|Perhaps we should do the same.
p334_076|p334|I was inspired by two things.
p334_260|p334|They would be wise to do just that.
p334_274|p334|You can't go back and change things.
p334_248|p334|I'll always remember the horrible images.
p334_270|p334|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p334_264|p334|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p334_258|p334|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p334_072|p334|We are looking for volunteers.
p334_066|p334|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p334_099|p334|They chose to side with terror.
p334_106|p334|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p334_112|p334|It didn't take long.
p334_304|p334|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334_310|p334|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p334_338|p334|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p334_339|p334|Last night was a key episode.
p334_311|p334|The whole nation will be delighted.
p334_305|p334|He is a Satan.
p334_113|p334|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p334_107|p334|I didn't make those adjustments.
p334_098|p334|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p334_067|p334|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p334_073|p334|I had a sense of deja vu.
p334_259|p334|I am getting long in the tooth.
p334_265|p334|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p334_271|p334|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p334_267|p334|The weaknesses are few.
p334_273|p334|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
p334_298|p334|People are fed up.
p334_065|p334|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_071|p334|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p334_059|p334|It was totally my fault.
p334_111|p334|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p334_105|p334|That was a gold medal for certain.
p334_139|p334|This is the New Edinburgh.
p334_313|p334|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p334_307|p334|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p334_306|p334|I always felt they played for me.
p334_312|p334|The public have been very supportive.
p334_138|p334|Could you put it in writing?
p334_104|p334|We are not out of touch with politics.
p334_110|p334|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p334_058|p334|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p334_070|p334|He will need that machine.
p334_064|p334|He's very good at relating to adults.
p334_299|p334|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p334_272|p334|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
p334_266|p334|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p334_229|p334|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p334_201|p334|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
p334_215|p334|So the European elections are extremely important.
p334_003|p334|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p334_017|p334|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p334_177|p334|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p334_163|p334|The problem is the pitch.
p334_188|p334|No finals are to be contested today.
p334_349|p334|People acted too quickly.
p334_413|p334|The hangover was Olympian.
p334_375|p334|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p334_361|p334|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p334_407|p334|My wife and family are the support system.
p334_360|p334|This man is serious about his work.
p334_406|p334|This seems like a very good idea.
p334_412|p334|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p334_374|p334|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
p334_348|p334|I am content with the silver.
p334_189|p334|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p334_162|p334|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p334_176|p334|But we have come under attack.
p334_016|p334|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p334_002|p334|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p334_214|p334|The approval system will be changed.
p334_200|p334|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p334_228|p334|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p334_216|p334|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p334_202|p334|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334_028|p334|I'd just like to play.
p334_014|p334|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p334_148|p334|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p334_160|p334|That is not just my personal view.
p334_174|p334|Do yourselves a favour.
p334_404|p334|We are going to change our party.
p334_362|p334|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p334_376|p334|I'm delighted for Simon.
p334_410|p334|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p334_389|p334|Would you take them?
p334_388|p334|I just don't know where he is.
p334_377|p334|His third goal was superb.
p334_411|p334|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p334_405|p334|It's the same as Glasgow.
p334_363|p334|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p334_175|p334|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p334_161|p334|The investment will be in the food.
p334_149|p334|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
p334_001|p334|Please call Stella.
p334_015|p334|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p334_029|p334|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p334_203|p334|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p334_217|p334|That period was a struggle.
p334_213|p334|The house was full of smoke.
p334_207|p334|The frustration was showing.
p334_011|p334|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p334_005|p334|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p334_039|p334|I think it can count against you now.
p334_165|p334|It does seem a mystery.
p334_171|p334|I see no need for change.
p334_159|p334|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p334_367|p334|This was a chilling echo.
p334_401|p334|And they all had these other commitments.
p334_415|p334|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
p334_373|p334|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p334_398|p334|I'm sure they love it.
p334_399|p334|I'd never seen a play about me.
p334_414|p334|We are here for the long term.
p334_372|p334|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p334_366|p334|We will miss him very much.
p334_400|p334|The track is currently covered in snow.
p334_158|p334|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p334_170|p334|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p334_164|p334|That's as it should be.
p334_038|p334|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
p334_004|p334|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p334_010|p334|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p334_206|p334|We'll have to work hard today.
p334_212|p334|But who cares?
p334_204|p334|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p334_210|p334|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p334_238|p334|I never wanted a legal battle.
p334_006|p334|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p334_012|p334|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p334_172|p334|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p334_166|p334|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p334_199|p334|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p334_370|p334|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p334_416|p334|A great deal has been achieved.
p334_402|p334|The report is due out next month.
p334_364|p334|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p334_358|p334|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p334_359|p334|It gave no further details.
p334_403|p334|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p334_365|p334|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p334_371|p334|January is a bad time of year.
p334_417|p334|Some things in life you have to accept.
p334_198|p334|I'm not changing my mind.
p334_167|p334|He looked very sharp.
p334_173|p334|But the Premiership is everything to us.
p334_013|p334|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p334_007|p334|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p334_239|p334|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
p334_211|p334|My friends were very envious.
p334_205|p334|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p334_208|p334|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p334_220|p334|We must improve our relations with government.
p334_234|p334|He took my breath away.
p334_022|p334|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p334_036|p334|We could feel the heat.
p334_156|p334|He was not deterred.
p334_142|p334|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p334_195|p334|We may make a short-term appointment.
p334_181|p334|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p334_368|p334|As a nation, we must become more active.
p334_354|p334|Ferguson should take note.
p334_340|p334|What did we learn?
p334_397|p334|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p334_383|p334|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p334_382|p334|I was so nervous.
p334_396|p334|The sun is worth a million dollars.
p334_341|p334|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p334_355|p334|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
p334_369|p334|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p334_180|p334|I'd love to be like Peter.
p334_194|p334|This is a step backwards.
p334_143|p334|Our offer will remain on the table.
p334_157|p334|This commitment should be built upon.
p334_037|p334|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p334_023|p334|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p334_235|p334|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
p334_221|p334|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p334_209|p334|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p334_237|p334|After that it is up to the boss.
p334_223|p334|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p334_009|p334|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p334_035|p334|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334_021|p334|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p334_169|p334|Two of the team became ill.
p334_141|p334|And that's good news for the magpies.
p334_155|p334|And therein lies the whole problem.
p334_182|p334|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p334_196|p334|He will address the nation this evening.
p334_419|p334|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p334_343|p334|He's a key player in Scotland.
p334_357|p334|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p334_380|p334|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p334_394|p334|He sat down at the piano.
p334_395|p334|His condition was stable last night.
p334_381|p334|His son is a local legend.
p334_356|p334|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p334_424|p334|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p334_342|p334|I knew he was dying.
p334_418|p334|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p334_197|p334|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p334_183|p334|That is his attitude to things.
p334_154|p334|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p334_140|p334|We all thought we were going to die.
p334_168|p334|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p334_020|p334|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334_034|p334|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_008|p334|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p334_222|p334|The list is too long for this piece.
p334_236|p334|I will have to order its destruction.
p334_232|p334|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p334_226|p334|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p334_030|p334|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p334_024|p334|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p334_018|p334|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p334_144|p334|The world is split into two.
p334_150|p334|Why is that?
p334_178|p334|What do they do, anyway?
p334_187|p334|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p334_193|p334|It is in our own hands.
p334_346|p334|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p334_420|p334|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p334_352|p334|You have to audition for jobs.
p334_408|p334|It remains in public ownership.
p334_385|p334|It's to do with context.
p334_391|p334|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p334_390|p334|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334_384|p334|His death was a tragic accident.
p334_409|p334|The Master was by then just too old.
p334_353|p334|What would you do if you didn't work?
p334_347|p334|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334_421|p334|I think it is totally wrong.
p334_192|p334|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p334_186|p334|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334_179|p334|He was just like a godfather to it.
p334_151|p334|It is extremely sad.
p334_145|p334|They deserve a lot of credit.
p334_019|p334|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p334_025|p334|A judicial review is also being considered.
p334_031|p334|It was no surprise.
p334_227|p334|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334_233|p334|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p334_225|p334|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334_231|p334|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p334_219|p334|You just have to accept.
p334_027|p334|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p334_033|p334|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p334_153|p334|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334_147|p334|It was so physical.
p334_190|p334|That night was a terrible muddle.
p334_184|p334|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p334_351|p334|We took the chances when they came.
p334_423|p334|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p334_345|p334|She wondered why we were interested.
p334_379|p334|He said to me, Which one, son?
p334_392|p334|He would take up the bike.
p334_386|p334|This fight is not going to go away.
p334_387|p334|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p334_393|p334|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p334_378|p334|Here we have not had one hour.
p334_422|p334|It's not realistic because it's early days.
p334_344|p334|He loved his children.
p334_350|p334|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
p334_185|p334|And what was that like, as an experience?
p334_191|p334|His English counterpart agreed.
p334_146|p334|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p334_032|p334|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334_026|p334|I want to win this thing.
p334_218|p334|We are determined to establish the facts.
p334_230|p334|So far they have refused.
p334_224|p334|I can't blame the fans.
p334_243|p334|They are not an item.
p334_257|p334|They are there to get people into work.
p334_280|p334|They should stop the bombing.
p334_294|p334|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p334_069|p334|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334_041|p334|It was an accounting error.
p334_055|p334|It is something that we will put right.
p334_082|p334|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p334_096|p334|It was a foolhardy decision.
p334_109|p334|We have it on video.
p334_135|p334|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
p334_121|p334|It's not one for the purist.
p334_337|p334|With actors it is slightly different.
p334_323|p334|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334_322|p334|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
p334_336|p334|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p334_120|p334|He also received a medal of honour.
p334_134|p334|Some of his family still live there.
p334_108|p334|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p334_097|p334|It means they actually control the programme.
p334_083|p334|This must be really short of ideas.
p334_054|p334|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p334_040|p334|I wanted to win so badly.
p334_068|p334|It was a move which appealed to him.
p334_295|p334|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334_281|p334|They'll have to pay more.
p334_256|p334|My players have no idea about football.
p334_242|p334|A venue was found.
p334_268|p334|I may think about performing it.
p334_254|p334|Check that he is dead.
p334_240|p334|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p334_297|p334|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p334_283|p334|Does it, Noel?
p334_056|p334|Why do it?
p334_042|p334|I had enough on.
p334_095|p334|I thought they played very well.
p334_081|p334|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334_122|p334|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p334_136|p334|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p334_308|p334|They must be kept on the ground.
p334_320|p334|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p334_334|p334|The plot is simple.
p334_335|p334|They've not let anyone into the loop.
p334_321|p334|I welcome this new service.
p334_309|p334|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p334_137|p334|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p334_123|p334|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p334_080|p334|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_094|p334|Libya is an easy target.
p334_043|p334|The offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_057|p334|It could take three days.
p334_282|p334|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334_296|p334|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p334_241|p334|It had won an investors in people award.
p334_255|p334|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334_269|p334|I would recommend it.
p334_251|p334|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334_245|p334|Is that Titanic?
p334_279|p334|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334_292|p334|You've been a great audience.
p334_286|p334|The Open champion is back.
p334_053|p334|plays in dark blue.
p334_047|p334|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p334_090|p334|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p334_084|p334|It was extremely cold.
p334_127|p334|It's a matter of huge concern.
p334_133|p334|It was a simple question.
p334_325|p334|It was a UK-wide report.
p334_331|p334|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p334_319|p334|It's ahead of Labour.
p334_318|p334|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p334_330|p334|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p334_324|p334|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p334_132|p334|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p334_126|p334|It is a time bomb.
p334_085|p334|They use them for everything.
p334_091|p334|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p334_046|p334|No meaningful response was issued.
p334_052|p334|It is a form of physical exercise.
p334_287|p334|It's going to be a new challenge.
p334_293|p334|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p334_278|p334|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p334_244|p334|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p334_250|p334|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p334_246|p334|He was to get his chance.
p334_252|p334|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
p334_285|p334|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p334_291|p334|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p334_044|p334|There were no passengers on board.
p334_050|p334|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_078|p334|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p334_087|p334|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p334_093|p334|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334_130|p334|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p334_124|p334|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p334_118|p334|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p334_332|p334|Are you from the rugby?
p334_326|p334|The law should be changed.
p334_327|p334|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p334_333|p334|The attack was totally unprovoked.
p334_119|p334|We tend to come good at the end.
p334_125|p334|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p334_131|p334|It was just an accident of birth.
p334_092|p334|We already have them, all over Europe.
p334_086|p334|We have the easy part.
p334_079|p334|Maybe that was the whole point.
p334_051|p334|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_045|p334|And we're not there yet.
p334_290|p334|I want to keep him.
p334_284|p334|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p334_253|p334|I'm getting back up there now.
p334_247|p334|So, the question is, is it any good?
p302_248|p302|He should be a great asset.
p302_076|p302|You do have a way out.
p302_062|p302|He said it was the worst possible result.
p302_089|p302|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p302_102|p302|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p302_116|p302|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p302_300|p302|The frustration was showing.
p302_314|p302|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p302_315|p302|It's like the Russians.
p302_301|p302|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p302_117|p302|I want to play at the highest level.
p302_103|p302|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p302_088|p302|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p302_063|p302|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p302_077|p302|It is simple, really.
p302_249|p302|It means they actually control the programme.
p302_261|p302|He also received a medal of honour.
p302_275|p302|That got me out of jail.
p302_263|p302|She said he showed no remorse.
p302_277|p302|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p302_288|p302|They came into collision with Sergio.
p302_061|p302|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p302_075|p302|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p302_049|p302|Happily we found it in the library.
p302_115|p302|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p302_101|p302|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p302_129|p302|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p302_303|p302|My friends were very envious.
p302_302|p302|I am a wealthy person.
p302_316|p302|Is that Titanic?
p302_128|p302|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p302_100|p302|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p302_114|p302|It is time for a more honest approach.
p302_048|p302|What's it got to do with art?
p302_074|p302|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p302_060|p302|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p302_289|p302|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p302_276|p302|We have turned the corner.
p302_262|p302|It's not one for the purists.
p302_266|p302|It is a time bomb.
p302_272|p302|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p302_299|p302|I really don't understand what is happening.
p302_058|p302|We must improve our relations with the government.
p302_064|p302|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p302_070|p302|But it was to no avail.
p302_138|p302|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p302_110|p302|I hope they understand that.
p302_104|p302|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p302_312|p302|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p302_306|p302|We are determined to establish the facts.
p302_307|p302|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p302_313|p302|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p302_105|p302|It separates the men from the boys.
p302_111|p302|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p302_139|p302|The singer's condition was not specified.
p302_071|p302|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p302_065|p302|It is just part of modern day life.
p302_059|p302|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p302_298|p302|It all seemed so easy.
p302_267|p302|It's a matter of huge concern.
p302_259|p302|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p302_271|p302|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p302_265|p302|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p302_073|p302|That alibi is now gone.
p302_067|p302|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p302_098|p302|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p302_107|p302|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p302_305|p302|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p302_311|p302|It plans to return to this field.
p302_310|p302|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p302_304|p302|The snipers are also out.
p302_112|p302|She will also get a pay rise.
p302_106|p302|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
p302_099|p302|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p302_066|p302|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p302_072|p302|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p302_264|p302|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p302_270|p302|The outstanding issues are still there.
p302_258|p302|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p302_217|p302|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p302_203|p302|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p302_015|p302|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
p302_001|p302|Please call Stella.
p302_029|p302|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p302_161|p302|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p302_175|p302|It is time to come into the limelight.
p302_149|p302|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p302_148|p302|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p302_174|p302|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p302_160|p302|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p302_028|p302|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p302_014|p302|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p302_202|p302|I've never been limited on drugs.
p302_216|p302|A judicial review is also being considered.
p302_200|p302|They had not been handcuffed.
p302_214|p302|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p302_228|p302|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p302_002|p302|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p302_016|p302|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p302_176|p302|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p302_162|p302|The red card was okay.
p302_189|p302|People buy everything with cash.
p302_188|p302|I'm really proud of my young players.
p302_163|p302|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p302_177|p302|His name is Michael Owen.
p302_017|p302|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p302_003|p302|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p302_229|p302|It is something that we will put right.
p302_215|p302|Is this accurate?
p302_201|p302|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p302_239|p302|They follow him everywhere.
p302_205|p302|We have chosen for the patients.
p302_211|p302|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p302_007|p302|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p302_173|p302|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p302_167|p302|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p302_198|p302|This must be kept in total perspective.
p302_199|p302|All the names are familiar to me.
p302_166|p302|I was doing well at the hustings.
p302_172|p302|And now he tells us.
p302_012|p302|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p302_006|p302|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p302_210|p302|I was surprised by his response.
p302_204|p302|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p302_238|p302|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p302_212|p302|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p302_206|p302|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p302_038|p302|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p302_010|p302|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p302_004|p302|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p302_158|p302|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p302_164|p302|But they will not be compelled to join.
p302_170|p302|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p302_171|p302|There is no date on this document.
p302_165|p302|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p302_159|p302|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p302_005|p302|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p302_011|p302|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p302_039|p302|All of us do.
p302_207|p302|Why should we even be asked to share?
p302_213|p302|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p302_236|p302|This is a club on the rise.
p302_222|p302|It was a total surprise.
p302_034|p302|My game is in pretty good shape.
p302_020|p302|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p302_008|p302|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p302_140|p302|How much of a cop out is that?
p302_154|p302|I know you went back this morning.
p302_168|p302|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p302_183|p302|Smith has not let him down.
p302_197|p302|It's not just for classical music.
p302_196|p302|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p302_182|p302|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p302_169|p302|We must put a marker down.
p302_155|p302|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p302_141|p302|The whole region is in shock.
p302_009|p302|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p302_021|p302|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p302_035|p302|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p302_223|p302|I had enough on.
p302_237|p302|I had a sense of deja vu.
p302_221|p302|They make it look very easy.
p302_235|p302|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p302_209|p302|There is a great potential on this river.
p302_023|p302|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
p302_037|p302|We used to keep our business rates.
p302_157|p302|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p302_143|p302|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
p302_194|p302|Or so we have long assumed.
p302_180|p302|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p302_181|p302|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p302_195|p302|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p302_142|p302|It will be the final push.
p302_156|p302|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p302_036|p302|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p302_022|p302|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p302_208|p302|Which means it matters.
p302_234|p302|I'm pleased with the horse.
p302_220|p302|Appointed general secretary last September.
p302_218|p302|They could go no further forward.
p302_224|p302|And we're not there yet.
p302_230|p302|Survival is our aim.
p302_026|p302|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p302_032|p302|He's not very big, either.
p302_152|p302|That sort of thing is long gone.
p302_146|p302|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p302_191|p302|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
p302_185|p302|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p302_184|p302|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p302_190|p302|There was great support all round the route.
p302_147|p302|I could feel the blood on my face.
p302_153|p302|I'm afraid to say anything.
p302_033|p302|I've taken to the hills.
p302_027|p302|Each one has its own system.
p302_231|p302|There is no reason at all.
p302_225|p302|No meaningful response was issued.
p302_219|p302|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p302_233|p302|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p302_227|p302|plays in dark blue.
p302_019|p302|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p302_031|p302|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p302_025|p302|It does make a big difference.
p302_179|p302|I will have to order its destruction.
p302_145|p302|It is a very interesting subject.
p302_151|p302|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p302_186|p302|They have two children.
p302_192|p302|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p302_193|p302|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
p302_187|p302|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p302_150|p302|Debbie Harry was cool.
p302_144|p302|You were the kidnappers.
p302_024|p302|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p302_030|p302|It is a very special city.
p302_018|p302|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p302_226|p302|It is a form of physical exercise.
p302_232|p302|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p302_255|p302|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p302_241|p302|There was no safety net.
p302_269|p302|Three years probation is just a joke.
p302_296|p302|I've got a young family.
p302_282|p302|I see no need for change.
p302_057|p302|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p302_043|p302|Theatre is not a museum.
p302_094|p302|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p302_080|p302|You, the British people, are the boss.
p302_123|p302|Do not go into government buildings.
p302_137|p302|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p302_309|p302|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p302_308|p302|The list is too long for this piece.
p302_136|p302|Do you think they would be any better?
p302_122|p302|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p302_081|p302|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p302_095|p302|There was an element of jealousy.
p302_042|p302|We are looking for volunteers.
p302_056|p302|Henry was strong and talented.
p302_283|p302|Do yourselves a favour.
p302_297|p302|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p302_268|p302|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p302_240|p302|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p302_254|p302|We are at a crossroads.
p302_242|p302|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p302_281|p302|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p302_295|p302|We work on the same level.
p302_040|p302|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p302_054|p302|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p302_068|p302|YOU thought it was a headache.
p302_083|p302|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p302_097|p302|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p302_134|p302|It has been in place since last July.
p302_120|p302|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p302_108|p302|Two and a half million people have died.
p302_109|p302|Or so it would appear.
p302_121|p302|The trial is set for February.
p302_135|p302|The European Court is our only option.
p302_096|p302|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p302_082|p302|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
p302_069|p302|I hope we can put it behind us.
p302_055|p302|The days of empty promises are over.
p302_041|p302|It could have been just a quick fix.
p302_294|p302|Is something which we just don't do.
p302_280|p302|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p302_257|p302|It didn't take long.
p302_243|p302|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p302_247|p302|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p302_253|p302|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p302_284|p302|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p302_290|p302|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p302_079|p302|I was in jail for five years.
p302_045|p302|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p302_051|p302|There was nobody on the roof.
p302_086|p302|She could easily have been killed.
p302_092|p302|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p302_119|p302|It ignores the future.
p302_131|p302|I heard some of his remarks.
p302_125|p302|We are still getting signals.
p302_124|p302|There is only one caveat.
p302_130|p302|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p302_118|p302|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p302_093|p302|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p302_087|p302|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p302_050|p302|I know a lot of people who don't.
p302_044|p302|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p302_078|p302|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p302_291|p302|He is a success story by any standard.
p302_285|p302|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p302_252|p302|We could have got three medals.
p302_246|p302|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p302_278|p302|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p302_250|p302|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p302_244|p302|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p302_293|p302|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p302_287|p302|I'd love to be like Peter.
p302_052|p302|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p302_046|p302|He could face a jail sentence.
p302_091|p302|He was a crazy man.
p302_085|p302|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p302_126|p302|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p302_132|p302|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p302_133|p302|I was just overwhelmed.
p302_127|p302|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p302_084|p302|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p302_090|p302|The same goes for personnel.
p302_047|p302|They don't take you to mass graves.
p302_053|p302|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p302_286|p302|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p302_292|p302|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p302_245|p302|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p302_251|p302|We are not out of touch with politics.
p302_279|p302|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p305_234|p305|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305_220|p305|It may be his last for a while, too.
p305_208|p305|I believe in the Church.
p305_383|p305|We're not an employment agency.
p305_397|p305|She had every right to read the warrant.
p305_340|p305|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p305_354|p305|It was a long process, but we got there.
p305_368|p305|The Dow Jones is way up.
p305_181|p305|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p305_195|p305|It just came into my head that day.
p305_142|p305|Other people also tried.
p305_156|p305|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p305_157|p305|We have all been shocked by her death.
p305_143|p305|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p305_194|p305|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p305_180|p305|So he is open to ideas.
p305_369|p305|Now there is an even bigger target.
p305_355|p305|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p305_341|p305|I'm just doing artwork.
p305_396|p305|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p305_382|p305|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p305_209|p305|Others were even less confident.
p305_221|p305|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p305_235|p305|I think we have a very strong case.
p305_023|p305|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p305_037|p305|Who has he fought?
p305_021|p305|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p305_035|p305|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p305_009|p305|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p305_223|p305|The parents will have a great time, too.
p305_237|p305|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p305_394|p305|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p305_380|p305|He was released in March this year.
p305_357|p305|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p305_343|p305|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305_419|p305|I'll take what comes along.
p305_196|p305|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p305_182|p305|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p305_155|p305|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p305_141|p305|I haven't made the donation yet.
p305_169|p305|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p305_168|p305|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p305_140|p305|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p305_154|p305|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p305_183|p305|We are expected to do better than before.
p305_197|p305|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p305_418|p305|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p305_342|p305|And we still have to pay his salary.
p305_356|p305|The whole team was rubbish.
p305_381|p305|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p305_395|p305|I can't stop people thinking.
p305_236|p305|It should be a great game, though.
p305_222|p305|Then one night only three people turn up.
p305_008|p305|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p305_034|p305|We have high hopes that this will work.
p305_020|p305|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p305_018|p305|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p305_024|p305|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p305_030|p305|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p305_226|p305|Appointments should be made on merit.
p305_232|p305|There will not be any charges.
p305_391|p305|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p305_385|p305|The court had a number of empty seats.
p305_408|p305|I didn't do too badly myself.
p305_352|p305|We will see how he is.
p305_346|p305|Their three other children had died as infants.
p305_420|p305|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p305_193|p305|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p305_187|p305|It is giving out the wrong message.
p305_178|p305|He was lying face down in the water.
p305_150|p305|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p305_144|p305|It would have very little impact on them.
p305_145|p305|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p305_151|p305|They just made me feel dizzy.
p305_179|p305|He urged people to forgive.
p305_186|p305|Angola was a really hard place.
p305_192|p305|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p305_347|p305|We knew nothing about it.
p305_421|p305|Women reported more depression than men.
p305_353|p305|The fans will support us.
p305_409|p305|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p305_384|p305|People might not actually want the job.
p305_390|p305|The package has been properly costed.
p305_233|p305|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p305_227|p305|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305_031|p305|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p305_025|p305|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p305_019|p305|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p305_033|p305|We had a reunion last week.
p305_027|p305|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p305_219|p305|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p305_231|p305|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p305_225|p305|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305_386|p305|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p305_392|p305|The love affair was over.
p305_379|p305|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p305_345|p305|I didn't have a trio.
p305_351|p305|Our children are our future.
p305_184|p305|The attacker died in the crash.
p305_190|p305|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p305_147|p305|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p305_153|p305|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p305_152|p305|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p305_146|p305|My future is in the marathon.
p305_191|p305|We want to keep the pound.
p305_185|p305|I am not even thinking about that.
p305_350|p305|We have got a full house tonight.
p305_422|p305|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p305_344|p305|So there's a double whammy.
p305_378|p305|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
p305_393|p305|For some, it was more painful than others.
p305_387|p305|It broke up my marriage.
p305_224|p305|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p305_230|p305|Everything was up for grabs.
p305_218|p305|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p305_026|p305|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p305_032|p305|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p305_096|p305|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p305_082|p305|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p305_055|p305|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p305_041|p305|Players were held in equally low regard.
p305_069|p305|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p305_294|p305|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305_280|p305|The case will now go to appeal.
p305_257|p305|Israel has done very little until now.
p305_243|p305|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p305_323|p305|We didn't know he was even out.
p305_337|p305|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p305_121|p305|It is a vicious circle.
p305_135|p305|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p305_109|p305|They make a selective perception process.
p305_108|p305|She is a double victim.
p305_134|p305|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p305_120|p305|He seemed to lose his focus.
p305_336|p305|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p305_322|p305|I just could not cope.
p305_242|p305|They were not doing it too well, either.
p305_256|p305|But there was a shift.
p305_281|p305|They really did a great job.
p305_295|p305|My house was shaking at the time.
p305_068|p305|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305_040|p305|It would show them a positive way forward.
p305_054|p305|We see little sign of improvement.
p305_083|p305|However, it is much bigger than that.
p305_097|p305|My grandparents were terrified.
p305_081|p305|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p305_095|p305|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p305_042|p305|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p305_056|p305|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305_283|p305|It was worth a photograph.
p305_297|p305|This is a very positive step forward.
p305_240|p305|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p305_254|p305|I still feel like a wee boy.
p305_268|p305|It's an internal matter.
p305_334|p305|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p305_320|p305|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p305_308|p305|It worked, up to a point.
p305_136|p305|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p305_122|p305|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p305_123|p305|There has been no delay on government orders.
p305_137|p305|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p305_309|p305|One season, they might do well.
p305_321|p305|I know the worry over Iraq.
p305_335|p305|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p305_269|p305|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p305_255|p305|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p305_241|p305|I have been here for only three months.
p305_296|p305|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p305_282|p305|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p305_057|p305|For example they could be in school uniform.
p305_043|p305|He stands on Centre Court alone.
p305_094|p305|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p305_080|p305|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p305_084|p305|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
p305_090|p305|His handling raises a wider issue.
p305_047|p305|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p305_053|p305|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305_286|p305|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p305_292|p305|Most of the public are behind me.
p305_279|p305|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p305_245|p305|How could anyone take issue with that?
p305_251|p305|She did not attend the courtroom.
p305_319|p305|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p305_331|p305|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p305_325|p305|Here are some possible solutions.
p305_133|p305|You can never have enough money.
p305_127|p305|How do you respond to losing your child?
p305_126|p305|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p305_132|p305|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305_324|p305|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p305_330|p305|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p305_318|p305|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p305_250|p305|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p305_244|p305|We hope this scheme will change that.
p305_278|p305|Yet he chose to do something different.
p305_293|p305|It really is a gift to the world.
p305_287|p305|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p305_052|p305|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p305_046|p305|They receive a high profile in the media.
p305_091|p305|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p305_085|p305|The jury is still out.
p305_093|p305|You've got it coming Kabul.
p305_087|p305|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p305_078|p305|This has not, and has been neglected.
p305_050|p305|But don't expect an easy ride.
p305_044|p305|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p305_291|p305|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p305_285|p305|The road was closed for several hours.
p305_252|p305|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p305_246|p305|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p305_326|p305|He made so many bad decisions.
p305_332|p305|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p305_118|p305|We've come from a long way back.
p305_124|p305|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p305_130|p305|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p305_131|p305|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p305_125|p305|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p305_119|p305|A lot of things can go wrong.
p305_333|p305|One must hope not!
p305_327|p305|We are now up against it.
p305_247|p305|They were at her bedside when she died.
p305_253|p305|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p305_284|p305|I love you so very much.
p305_290|p305|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p305_045|p305|There was a fine line to tread.
p305_051|p305|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p305_079|p305|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p305_086|p305|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p305_092|p305|He had done his homework properly.
p305_074|p305|I've come here for the jersey.
p305_060|p305|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p305_048|p305|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p305_289|p305|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305_276|p305|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p305_262|p305|I don't think it could be clearer.
p305_302|p305|We've been there for seven years.
p305_316|p305|It is still holding good today.
p305_100|p305|They never looked like winning it either.
p305_114|p305|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p305_128|p305|Who is the employer?
p305_129|p305|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p305_115|p305|Each day is a new beginning.
p305_101|p305|The party lasted all night.
p305_317|p305|The budget was too low for that.
p305_303|p305|They made a huge impression on me.
p305_263|p305|We can only go up.
p305_277|p305|They married in August last year.
p305_288|p305|My aim is a top six finish.
p305_049|p305|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_061|p305|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_075|p305|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p305_088|p305|I drove the ball well.
p305_063|p305|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p305_077|p305|That would open the gates of hell.
p305_261|p305|We certainly will need to watch him.
p305_275|p305|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p305_249|p305|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p305_315|p305|I think the Government should pay for that.
p305_301|p305|She is a very lucky lady.
p305_329|p305|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p305_117|p305|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p305_103|p305|It is understood they saw one body.
p305_102|p305|No details of the talks were given.
p305_116|p305|My daughter is an adult.
p305_328|p305|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p305_300|p305|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p305_314|p305|She told me to apply for the crest.
p305_248|p305|They had had time for little else.
p305_274|p305|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p305_260|p305|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p305_076|p305|I'm so proud of my team.
p305_062|p305|That tells you something about them.
p305_089|p305|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p305_099|p305|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p305_066|p305|I've had to take time off work today.
p305_072|p305|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p305_258|p305|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p305_264|p305|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p305_270|p305|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p305_338|p305|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p305_310|p305|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p305_304|p305|His signature is his handwriting.
p305_112|p305|There was an e-mail.
p305_106|p305|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p305_107|p305|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p305_113|p305|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p305_305|p305|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p305_311|p305|We've got a great defensive club.
p305_339|p305|This time, there were no such rewards.
p305_271|p305|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p305_265|p305|Our offer will remain on the table.
p305_259|p305|The death rates are still as high.
p305_073|p305|I've put my own money into this project.
p305_067|p305|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p305_098|p305|Are they control freaks?
p305_059|p305|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p305_071|p305|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305_065|p305|I am a drug addict.
p305_298|p305|This is a huge confidence boost.
p305_273|p305|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p305_267|p305|The website is now being amended.
p305_307|p305|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p305_313|p305|I feel privileged to be here.
p305_139|p305|They do the work, you know.
p305_105|p305|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p305_111|p305|It's the way we go about it.
p305_110|p305|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p305_104|p305|It was a wilful act of violence.
p305_138|p305|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p305_312|p305|It's up to their parents to choose.
p305_306|p305|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305_266|p305|He is a man who lives to work.
p305_272|p305|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p305_299|p305|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p305_064|p305|This rule is archaic.
p305_070|p305|However, consumers may take a different view.
p305_058|p305|This film will be totally awesome.
p305_017|p305|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p305_003|p305|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p305_215|p305|Every game against New Zealand is.
p305_201|p305|The actors just have to say so.
p305_229|p305|Gilbert was not amused.
p305_361|p305|They too refused to come out and talk.
p305_407|p305|See it while you can.
p305_413|p305|We suspect he was pleased.
p305_375|p305|We're all in a state of shock.
p305_349|p305|I hope my successor will do the same.
p305_188|p305|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p305_163|p305|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p305_177|p305|This is a dream come true for me.
p305_176|p305|That has given me great confidence.
p305_162|p305|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p305_189|p305|The sleeper was six hours late.
p305_348|p305|I am astonished by this decision.
p305_412|p305|Such people do not exist.
p305_374|p305|This must have been severe.
p305_360|p305|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p305_406|p305|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p305_228|p305|I think we will join the single currency.
p305_200|p305|He would help me with the form.
p305_214|p305|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305_002|p305|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p305_016|p305|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p305_014|p305|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p305_028|p305|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p305_202|p305|The minister is the engineer.
p305_216|p305|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p305_389|p305|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p305_376|p305|I thought he was part of the camera.
p305_410|p305|He has never even been to Ireland.
p305_404|p305|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p305_362|p305|It gave me something to focus on.
p305_174|p305|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p305_160|p305|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p305_148|p305|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p305_149|p305|They chose to side with terror.
p305_161|p305|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p305_175|p305|I got on very well with Allan.
p305_405|p305|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p305_363|p305|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p305_377|p305|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p305_411|p305|We believe the squad will stay together.
p305_388|p305|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p305_217|p305|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p305_203|p305|I think it was briefly considered.
p305_029|p305|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p305_015|p305|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p305_001|p305|Please call Stella.
p305_039|p305|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p305_005|p305|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p305_011|p305|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p305_207|p305|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p305_213|p305|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305_398|p305|Several people were out in the street.
p305_415|p305|She always wanted her own way.
p305_373|p305|The company has other problems with the shells.
p305_367|p305|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p305_401|p305|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p305_159|p305|He had worked there for only two days.
p305_171|p305|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p305_165|p305|We have already begun to do that here.
p305_164|p305|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p305_170|p305|I got off to a great start.
p305_158|p305|We are asking the council to think again.
p305_366|p305|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p305_400|p305|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p305_414|p305|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p305_372|p305|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p305_399|p305|There is too much at stake for that.
p305_212|p305|You may have a short memory.
p305_206|p305|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p305_010|p305|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p305_004|p305|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p305_038|p305|I want a free vote.
p305_012|p305|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p305_006|p305|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p305_238|p305|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p305_210|p305|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305_204|p305|It's a hidden problem.
p305_358|p305|I put the drawing down.
p305_402|p305|The place became a war zone.
p305_364|p305|It's a source of deep concern.
p305_370|p305|There has been a big change in defence.
p305_416|p305|But it is all by design.
p305_199|p305|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p305_166|p305|The home team also had their moments.
p305_172|p305|The actor has met with Mandela.
p305_173|p305|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p305_167|p305|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p305_198|p305|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p305_371|p305|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p305_417|p305|We've still got a say in this.
p305_403|p305|It is not an abortion.
p305_365|p305|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p305_359|p305|They feel it belongs to them.
p305_205|p305|I lost a part of me.
p305_211|p305|So people will come out with these things.
p305_239|p305|So the process was refined.
p305_007|p305|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p305_013|p305|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p351_168|p351|Well, what can you do?
p351_197|p351|We expect a full house on the night.
p351_183|p351|We were extremely poor.
p351_356|p351|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p351_424|p351|I kept going for her.
p351_342|p351|I am proud of my team.
p351_418|p351|It was visibly on fire.
p351_395|p351|What is it about this series?
p351_381|p351|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p351_222|p351|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
p351_236|p351|The case was continued.
p351_020|p351|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p351_034|p351|Teachers have been given the offer.
p351_008|p351|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p351_009|p351|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p351_035|p351|We have to win every game.
p351_021|p351|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p351_237|p351|That is important for the club.
p351_223|p351|I was happily surprised.
p351_380|p351|I am happy for her.
p351_394|p351|I am so, so, so lucky.
p351_419|p351|What's it for, after all?
p351_343|p351|I am a doctor.
p351_357|p351|It's too horrible to think.
p351_182|p351|That's the way things are heading.
p351_196|p351|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
p351_169|p351|It is not the message alone.
p351_141|p351|We will be victorious.
p351_155|p351|This was a very tragic accident.
p351_143|p351|It was the crowning point of my career.
p351_157|p351|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p351_180|p351|It would have very little impact on them.
p351_194|p351|It is crucial to understand this in context.
p351_341|p351|But he has strong links to Labour.
p351_355|p351|It's only tackling congestion.
p351_369|p351|This was not the show for me.
p351_382|p351|They were just too good for us.
p351_396|p351|You read it right.
p351_235|p351|I am very, very happy.
p351_221|p351|We just want them home.
p351_209|p351|It's a very important and beautiful day.
p351_037|p351|Both sides will be aware of this.
p351_023|p351|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p351_022|p351|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p351_036|p351|They also have good neighbours.
p351_208|p351|They are not a set of options.
p351_220|p351|He had worked there for only two days.
p351_234|p351|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p351_397|p351|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p351_383|p351|He was the architect.
p351_368|p351|The pain is still acute.
p351_354|p351|The Government has listened.
p351_340|p351|So we talked about that for a bit.
p351_195|p351|I now know that from memory.
p351_181|p351|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p351_156|p351|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p351_142|p351|The other question is why the scaling down?
p351_146|p351|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p351_152|p351|There is nothing they can't do.
p351_185|p351|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p351_191|p351|This was a great result for us, a big result.
p351_378|p351|They promised to fight the plans.
p351_422|p351|They have got off with murder.
p351_344|p351|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p351_350|p351|It will make a big difference.
p351_387|p351|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p351_393|p351|The research was my life.
p351_218|p351|The problem is worse in Scotland.
p351_230|p351|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p351_224|p351|It may not even be possible.
p351_032|p351|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p351_026|p351|I don't think they can complain about that.
p351_027|p351|I have not seen the term immediate.
p351_033|p351|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p351_225|p351|I think it is a scandal.
p351_231|p351|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p351_219|p351|This is a historic agreement.
p351_392|p351|This is the last straw.
p351_386|p351|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p351_351|p351|There was no basis for their arrest.
p351_423|p351|I'm going to take it further.
p351_345|p351|It will carry on.
p351_379|p351|My heart is not so sure.
p351_190|p351|This is a special place for me.
p351_184|p351|The parties have no contact.
p351_153|p351|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
p351_147|p351|It was a discussion paper.
p351_179|p351|Many other areas are coming up.
p351_151|p351|He is walking free.
p351_145|p351|It's just a fact.
p351_192|p351|Our policy is clear.
p351_186|p351|We are still paying the price for that.
p351_409|p351|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p351_353|p351|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p351_347|p351|I am not retiring.
p351_421|p351|A number of people could not speak English.
p351_390|p351|But it didn't happen.
p351_384|p351|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p351_227|p351|That, though, was then.
p351_233|p351|We've never seen so many.
p351_019|p351|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p351_025|p351|It was by the numbers.
p351_031|p351|He added, We have the same desire.
p351_030|p351|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p351_024|p351|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p351_018|p351|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p351_232|p351|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p351_226|p351|Perhaps it was just as well.
p351_385|p351|It's a fantastic achievement.
p351_391|p351|All were believed to be adults.
p351_346|p351|Our season is not over.
p351_420|p351|We will be pleased to talk to them.
p351_352|p351|This latter suggestion is very important.
p351_408|p351|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p351_187|p351|It was better than a soap opera.
p351_193|p351|This was an hour before the show.
p351_144|p351|But it will be sorted out this week.
p351_150|p351|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p351_178|p351|Clubs can only do so much.
p351_137|p351|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p351_123|p351|Last night he became one of the hunted.
p351_335|p351|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p351_321|p351|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p351_309|p351|Then you see it.
p351_241|p351|They want to play in the World Cup.
p351_255|p351|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p351_269|p351|There were moments of humour too.
p351_282|p351|We just wish they had done so before.
p351_296|p351|Were they under-age?
p351_043|p351|He is keen to stay in public service.
p351_057|p351|Now it has become a big picture.
p351_080|p351|I don't understand it.
p351_094|p351|The matter is under discussion.
p351_095|p351|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p351_081|p351|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p351_056|p351|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p351_042|p351|What are the barriers?
p351_297|p351|You are going to go to jail.
p351_283|p351|It was a virus.
p351_268|p351|It's got to come from me.
p351_254|p351|I want to create events.
p351_240|p351|Now he is in charge of this.
p351_308|p351|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p351_320|p351|He also seems to have been around forever.
p351_334|p351|He will go a long way.
p351_122|p351|We were not going to take that risk.
p351_136|p351|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p351_120|p351|We need to get the right people in.
p351_134|p351|We can play better than that.
p351_108|p351|The driver was unhurt.
p351_322|p351|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p351_336|p351|I lost a part of me.
p351_256|p351|The old manager, he didn't like me.
p351_242|p351|He was embarrassed about what he did.
p351_295|p351|She thought she was going to die.
p351_281|p351|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p351_054|p351|We could not compete with Rangers.
p351_040|p351|We are getting people into work.
p351_068|p351|That just wasn't good enough.
p351_097|p351|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p351_083|p351|I just wanted to get off the course.
p351_082|p351|He was rejected because he had retired.
p351_096|p351|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p351_069|p351|The working families tax credit is far better.
p351_041|p351|Will we ever play together again?
p351_055|p351|There was mystery back then.
p351_280|p351|This is welcome news.
p351_294|p351|Does it matter?
p351_243|p351|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p351_257|p351|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p351_337|p351|It's so much more fun.
p351_323|p351|Others are expected to do so soon.
p351_109|p351|Who will pay for this?
p351_135|p351|My whole family is.
p351_121|p351|It is a great shame.
p351_119|p351|This time it was out of the blue.
p351_125|p351|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p351_131|p351|He said it was the worst possible result.
p351_327|p351|Our approach will be different.
p351_333|p351|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
p351_253|p351|Now the show is for public consumption.
p351_247|p351|It got no better.
p351_290|p351|We were used to being in control.
p351_284|p351|The rest, of course, is history.
p351_079|p351|This youngster is so exciting!
p351_051|p351|This isn't a gimmick.
p351_045|p351|You had to go and see him.
p351_092|p351|Four had been brought down.
p351_086|p351|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p351_087|p351|Things are meant to be.
p351_093|p351|Only he's not as young as he looks.
p351_044|p351|Who are the democrats?
p351_050|p351|Instead we were shot in the back.
p351_078|p351|It is tough, but possible.
p351_285|p351|They chose the latter.
p351_291|p351|He's had a lot of injury problems.
p351_246|p351|He is under no illusions.
p351_252|p351|Now we are back on top of Europe.
p351_332|p351|He also called in at another farm.
p351_326|p351|I played well but missed a few chances.
p351_130|p351|I might come back.
p351_124|p351|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
p351_118|p351|There's nothing new in that argument.
p351_132|p351|But, still, it wasn't working.
p351_126|p351|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
p351_318|p351|He had no access to the database.
p351_330|p351|They're just a nonsense.
p351_324|p351|They were impressive against France.
p351_278|p351|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p351_244|p351|The home team also had their moments.
p351_250|p351|They seem to turn up for them.
p351_287|p351|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p351_293|p351|It happened again, and again, and again.
p351_046|p351|What did you learn in school today?
p351_052|p351|I won't go back.
p351_085|p351|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p351_091|p351|We have a rehearsal.
p351_090|p351|This is already happening.
p351_084|p351|She was also very brave.
p351_053|p351|There is no signature on this document.
p351_047|p351|We know we can defend it.
p351_292|p351|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
p351_286|p351|That was not the norm.
p351_251|p351|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
p351_245|p351|Haven't been so lucky since.
p351_279|p351|My only concern is for my children.
p351_325|p351|Seven people were already in custody in France.
p351_331|p351|That has not been the case, as we now know.
p351_319|p351|They were not up to the required standard.
p351_127|p351|The truth, of course, is very different.
p351_133|p351|That was my mistake.
p351_116|p351|It's the way we go about it.
p351_102|p351|That is not true.
p351_314|p351|There is good quality.
p351_300|p351|My mind was made up.
p351_328|p351|It's my initial background.
p351_260|p351|I think it was his parents.
p351_274|p351|They were too hard.
p351_248|p351|Some were close to tears.
p351_062|p351|My players are special.
p351_076|p351|His track record is impressive.
p351_089|p351|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p351_088|p351|One year later, he finally decided to act.
p351_077|p351|Clearly it is very disturbing.
p351_063|p351|We are the gateway to justice.
p351_249|p351|It has become a way of life.
p351_275|p351|This is not a message from ministers.
p351_261|p351|That is very important to people.
p351_329|p351|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p351_301|p351|It was an ongoing exercise.
p351_315|p351|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p351_103|p351|Yes, it was too short a night.
p351_117|p351|I will be ridiculed.
p351_101|p351|In part that reflected the times.
p351_115|p351|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
p351_129|p351|These will take a little time to develop.
p351_303|p351|He then did just that.
p351_317|p351|He will be really pleased about this.
p351_277|p351|I don't take that view.
p351_263|p351|This is a dream come true for me.
p351_288|p351|It is giving out the wrong message.
p351_075|p351|It was a pretty terrible day.
p351_061|p351|We are not the first to be affected.
p351_049|p351|He met his wife and married in England.
p351_048|p351|That is not the case.
p351_060|p351|They have been very lucky with the ice.
p351_074|p351|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p351_289|p351|I feel it is very irrational.
p351_262|p351|I certainly hope not.
p351_276|p351|We have been very patient.
p351_316|p351|But these things are happening now.
p351_302|p351|I would love to see it back there.
p351_128|p351|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p351_114|p351|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p351_100|p351|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p351_138|p351|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p351_104|p351|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
p351_110|p351|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
p351_306|p351|Who can predict?
p351_312|p351|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p351_272|p351|It happens from time to time.
p351_266|p351|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p351_299|p351|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p351_058|p351|The jury is still out.
p351_070|p351|those who are preparing to give up.
p351_064|p351|The devil is in the detail.
p351_065|p351|His handling raises a wider issue.
p351_071|p351|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p351_059|p351|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p351_298|p351|It is a very worrying report.
p351_267|p351|I feel pretty good.
p351_273|p351|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
p351_313|p351|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p351_307|p351|It was all very proper and civilised.
p351_111|p351|You have caught a serial killer.
p351_139|p351|There has been no delay on government orders.
p351_113|p351|What's the problem?
p351_107|p351|- Really you will !
p351_339|p351|It's getting to me.
p351_311|p351|We don't believe anything anymore.
p351_305|p351|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p351_259|p351|It was like being in prison.
p351_265|p351|There he goes again.
p351_271|p351|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p351_067|p351|We can't go home.
p351_073|p351|She was married with one son.
p351_098|p351|They have played their part.
p351_099|p351|They were unable to revive him.
p351_072|p351|I feel alive and good today.
p351_066|p351|We have got the school holidays on.
p351_270|p351|He has a wealth of experience.
p351_264|p351|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p351_258|p351|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p351_304|p351|He should have won.
p351_310|p351|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p351_338|p351|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p351_106|p351|We have no excuses.
p351_112|p351|It's all about money, money, money.
p351_175|p351|In many ways, that is as important.
p351_161|p351|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p351_149|p351|They will be ready.
p351_377|p351|She makes me so happy.
p351_411|p351|You need a licence to run a pub.
p351_405|p351|But is he?
p351_363|p351|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p351_388|p351|He, too, was not satisfied.
p351_203|p351|It makes a huge difference.
p351_217|p351|He took over our lives.
p351_001|p351|Please call Stella.
p351_015|p351|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p351_029|p351|It is my fault.
p351_028|p351|My Dad is a hero.
p351_014|p351|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p351_216|p351|Which is fair enough.
p351_202|p351|Ownership was the game.
p351_389|p351|It's easy to see why.
p351_404|p351|It should be a great game, though.
p351_362|p351|What's wrong with that?
p351_376|p351|But what lies ahead?
p351_410|p351|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p351_148|p351|My neighbours are horrified.
p351_160|p351|They might also be parlous.
p351_174|p351|But is that possible?
p351_162|p351|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p351_176|p351|I think we're going to make it.
p351_189|p351|I am just grateful he is alive.
p351_360|p351|It may be his last for a while, too.
p351_406|p351|So it's a daily struggle.
p351_412|p351|Everything else is second.
p351_374|p351|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p351_348|p351|Money is not everything in life.
p351_214|p351|No decision has yet been made.
p351_200|p351|We need to know more about her.
p351_228|p351|I grew up with them.
p351_016|p351|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p351_002|p351|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p351_003|p351|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p351_017|p351|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p351_229|p351|It was the train coming.
p351_201|p351|I went away to recover fully.
p351_215|p351|I have had a lovely summer.
p351_349|p351|She kept him on a string.
p351_413|p351|I am not sure.
p351_375|p351|Our message is getting through.
p351_407|p351|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p351_188|p351|There will be no change in government.
p351_177|p351|It was really frustrating.
p351_163|p351|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p351_167|p351|He is very confident at the moment.
p351_173|p351|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
p351_198|p351|He invented the language.
p351_359|p351|He was, but only just.
p351_403|p351|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p351_365|p351|I believe she was elected unopposed.
p351_371|p351|Frustration is not the word.
p351_417|p351|The plane was shaking.
p351_239|p351|Blood samples were taken.
p351_211|p351|But it was money well spent.
p351_205|p351|It's not a new device.
p351_013|p351|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p351_007|p351|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p351_006|p351|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p351_012|p351|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p351_204|p351|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p351_210|p351|If only the problems concerned the players.
p351_238|p351|He is doing the right things.
p351_370|p351|It is a very big problem.
p351_416|p351|The salary changes are long overdue.
p351_402|p351|It has proved a double whammy.
p351_364|p351|Off with their heads.
p351_358|p351|It can be frightening.
p351_199|p351|We want to play at the worlds.
p351_172|p351|He will be greatly missed.
p351_166|p351|It feels that the game is off.
p351_158|p351|It is the voice of the survivors.
p351_170|p351|They will be seen for years to come.
p351_164|p351|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p351_414|p351|This is a successful outcome.
p351_372|p351|The police have to act to help them.
p351_366|p351|We are not asking for the moon.
p351_400|p351|You find it bizarre?
p351_399|p351|Where does it come from?
p351_206|p351|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p351_212|p351|That's the most important thing for me.
p351_038|p351|They are not advertised.
p351_004|p351|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p351_010|p351|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p351_011|p351|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p351_005|p351|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p351_039|p351|I have got a wife to feed.
p351_213|p351|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p351_207|p351|Six years is too long.
p351_398|p351|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p351_367|p351|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p351_401|p351|I am very excited about this season.
p351_415|p351|His first album was a hit.
p351_373|p351|The cause is just.
p351_165|p351|It is not an escape.
p351_171|p351|I'm really happy with how things went there.
p351_159|p351|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p360_314|p360|And that match was played in June.
p360_102|p360|They had been forced to walk.
p360_116|p360|It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p360_089|p360|We discovered that for ourselves.
p360_076|p360|That perhaps is behind the problem.
p360_062|p360|No person was charged.
p360_248|p360|No one was injured.
p360_274|p360|Neither had the public.
p360_260|p360|We couldn't believe it at first.
p360_261|p360|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p360_275|p360|It disappeared into the cup.
p360_249|p360|We have had our debate.
p360_063|p360|But it would say that.
p360_077|p360|I have to hand it to the bank.
p360_088|p360|They couldn't keep it together.
p360_117|p360|This is a classic.
p360_103|p360|It is harder than you think.
p360_315|p360|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
p360_301|p360|He will be missed.
p360_329|p360|He has changed my life forever.
p360_317|p360|He is a sort of a mystery figure.
p360_303|p360|They were not at the property yesterday.
p360_129|p360|We have a long way to go.
p360_115|p360|It has no place in football.
p360_101|p360|It is not in the public interest.
p360_049|p360|But we are confident.
p360_061|p360|I can't believe she is dead.
p360_075|p360|It's worth it, though.
p360_288|p360|I have played well the past two days.
p360_263|p360|It can take a long time.
p360_277|p360|I have no further comment to make.
p360_276|p360|They might well be right.
p360_262|p360|He could still be President.
p360_289|p360|Is it on a building site?
p360_074|p360|That took two weeks.
p360_060|p360|But there is no easy option.
p360_048|p360|Is he conscious?
p360_100|p360|I have never considered it.
p360_114|p360|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p360_128|p360|But they are a good team.
p360_302|p360|I would not descend to that level.
p360_316|p360|I don't mean in a frightening way.
p360_312|p360|You just have to get on with it.
p360_306|p360|What does this mean?
p360_110|p360|They offered to make an investment into it.
p360_104|p360|The call was ignored.
p360_138|p360|That's the way they are.
p360_064|p360|Most of the works are small in scale.
p360_070|p360|His presence was very important.
p360_058|p360|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p360_299|p360|Why have you decided to get married?
p360_266|p360|He was pleased with his display.
p360_272|p360|Players have to accept this.
p360_273|p360|He is completely committed to us.
p360_267|p360|The first time you read a play.
p360_298|p360|He did it well.
p360_059|p360|The incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360_071|p360|What happens next?
p360_065|p360|He was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360_139|p360|Elections would follow in about two years.
p360_105|p360|I am looking forward to it.
p360_111|p360|People were hitting the floor.
p360_307|p360|They are not falling now.
p360_313|p360|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p360_305|p360|I'm really proud of her.
p360_311|p360|The meaning is very profound and complex.
p360_339|p360|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p360_107|p360|That would be even more disastrous.
p360_113|p360|They took a risk.
p360_098|p360|The release attracted little attention.
p360_073|p360|The bombing begins in five minutes.
p360_067|p360|But he just carried on anyway.
p360_271|p360|That was six years ago.
p360_265|p360|There is no answer to it.
p360_259|p360|It makes me feel difficult.
p360_258|p360|You will gain from that.
p360_264|p360|I don't intend to do so now.
p360_270|p360|He is having a nightmare.
p360_066|p360|Only the bomber was killed.
p360_072|p360|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p360_099|p360|It was the dreaded sentence.
p360_112|p360|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p360_106|p360|Consumers will also benefit.
p360_338|p360|But this is nonsense.
p360_310|p360|I've been waiting a long time.
p360_304|p360|We will not tolerate it.
p360_388|p360|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p360_405|p360|It was all too little, too late.
p360_363|p360|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p360_377|p360|Craig is a major concern for us.
p360_411|p360|What she can't have is the money.
p360_149|p360|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p360_161|p360|I told them they shouldn't say that.
p360_175|p360|There is an ongoing problem with this company.
p360_029|p360|You are not allowed to do that.
p360_015|p360|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p360_001|p360|Please call Stella.
p360_217|p360|We had to work hard for it.
p360_203|p360|She would say he was still the best.
p360_202|p360|I'm really looking forward to that.
p360_216|p360|But sometimes it was even worse.
p360_014|p360|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p360_028|p360|You have been warned.
p360_174|p360|I was a silly bastard.
p360_160|p360|However, we will have to wait and see.
p360_148|p360|It is deeply frustrating.
p360_376|p360|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p360_410|p360|I intend to end it on a high.
p360_404|p360|They had three children.
p360_362|p360|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p360_389|p360|No, they are not the same thing.
p360_348|p360|Our position is extremely simple.
p360_412|p360|I thought they played well.
p360_374|p360|What's the difference?
p360_360|p360|There was no-one of the required standard.
p360_406|p360|Still, it is a very good result for us.
p360_189|p360|Maintain the highest standards.
p360_176|p360|The process will start tomorrow.
p360_162|p360|I don't know how they do it.
p360_002|p360|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p360_016|p360|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p360_228|p360|It will be a huge difference.
p360_200|p360|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
p360_214|p360|It was one of those things.
p360_215|p360|I can understand that.
p360_201|p360|I sincerely hope not.
p360_229|p360|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p360_017|p360|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p360_003|p360|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p360_163|p360|Little is known about them.
p360_177|p360|Was the punishment excessive?
p360_188|p360|Only one person can claim the credit.
p360_361|p360|That would be very good for Rangers.
p360_407|p360|And he's not alone.
p360_413|p360|This is not the end.
p360_375|p360|The whole family was in shock.
p360_349|p360|Where did that finish?
p360_371|p360|I'm working on that one, too.
p360_417|p360|This was great for our sport.
p360_403|p360|It has great potential.
p360_365|p360|She has never been back.
p360_359|p360|He has never let them down.
p360_198|p360|Stardom is a funny thing.
p360_173|p360|Hopefully it will be a good day.
p360_167|p360|But the action is about to be restarted.
p360_007|p360|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p360_013|p360|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p360_205|p360|We didn't, and it worked for us.
p360_211|p360|We should have no more problems.
p360_239|p360|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p360_238|p360|This is a historic occasion.
p360_210|p360|They tried to give her advice.
p360_204|p360|It is dangerous and it is a lie.
p360_012|p360|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p360_006|p360|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p360_166|p360|A good actor doesn't think.
p360_172|p360|The next game is today.
p360_199|p360|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
p360_358|p360|That has to be allowed.
p360_402|p360|There is so much at stake.
p360_364|p360|That gives it a spirit.
p360_370|p360|The package is a changing one.
p360_416|p360|It's not an impression.
p360_399|p360|These were the edited highlights.
p360_366|p360|It will set the tone.
p360_400|p360|That is the difference.
p360_414|p360|And they went on to win the title.
p360_372|p360|Frankly, that's not good enough.
p360_164|p360|It is a new company for Scotland.
p360_170|p360|I have a good feeling about this.
p360_158|p360|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
p360_010|p360|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p360_004|p360|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p360_038|p360|I had to be into it.
p360_212|p360|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p360_206|p360|No-one has used it since then.
p360_207|p360|The baby was dead.
p360_213|p360|An announcement is expected soon.
p360_039|p360|I'm so grateful for that.
p360_005|p360|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p360_011|p360|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p360_159|p360|I didn't think we deserved to go out.
p360_171|p360|And the results were impressive.
p360_165|p360|We're very unhappy about it.
p360_415|p360|Now, she will not be running at all.
p360_373|p360|Or is it?
p360_367|p360|They are not going away.
p360_401|p360|You will need it.
p360_398|p360|The boat was fantastic.
p360_381|p360|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p360_395|p360|They could have been told in advance.
p360_418|p360|There's no place to hide.
p360_424|p360|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p360_342|p360|The atmosphere was excellent.
p360_356|p360|They said that they stood by their statement.
p360_183|p360|You have to wait.
p360_197|p360|Here it was very subdued.
p360_168|p360|It was extremely difficult.
p360_140|p360|We are trying to be realistic.
p360_154|p360|But other Ministers are not convinced.
p360_008|p360|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p360_034|p360|For once he was wrong.
p360_020|p360|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p360_236|p360|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p360_222|p360|It's a creative energy.
p360_223|p360|We are not conducting the review.
p360_237|p360|I want to celebrate the World Cup.
p360_021|p360|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p360_035|p360|He would not have to explain.
p360_009|p360|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p360_155|p360|First meeting was next week.
p360_141|p360|That was the theory.
p360_169|p360|It is about the script for me.
p360_196|p360|I think that he got the message.
p360_182|p360|I try to be clear in the narrative.
p360_357|p360|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p360_343|p360|That must have had an effect.
p360_419|p360|I don't think they are too serious.
p360_394|p360|I had to win this race.
p360_380|p360|What other retailer would do this?
p360_396|p360|And what do we have?
p360_382|p360|This country has many challenges.
p360_369|p360|I think he will.
p360_355|p360|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
p360_341|p360|There will be no backing down.
p360_194|p360|But it won't make a difference.
p360_180|p360|I could easy do that.
p360_157|p360|Conditions were very difficult for the players.
p360_143|p360|Now we look forward to it.
p360_023|p360|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p360_037|p360|We are just happy that hasn't happened.
p360_209|p360|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p360_221|p360|That has not changed.
p360_235|p360|I think he was lost for words.
p360_234|p360|So what's it all about?
p360_220|p360|I was pleased about that.
p360_208|p360|That remains the unanswered question.
p360_036|p360|I want to deliver a learning society.
p360_022|p360|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p360_142|p360|Or so it seemed.
p360_156|p360|No, we were not exactly favourites.
p360_181|p360|We are really impressed.
p360_195|p360|I'm not going to blame the band.
p360_340|p360|I'm going to miss it.
p360_354|p360|I would not do that.
p360_368|p360|Having done it, he was asked again.
p360_383|p360|Their families are gone.
p360_397|p360|It is a relief.
p360_393|p360|I am in a very difficult position.
p360_387|p360|They're all doing it.
p360_350|p360|I suppose it is quite exciting really.
p360_422|p360|They need time to think.
p360_344|p360|They have brought in the replacement.
p360_378|p360|The problems began a long time ago.
p360_191|p360|O Neill has delivered.
p360_185|p360|It's their moment of choice.
p360_152|p360|Our time is up.
p360_146|p360|Who was being affected?
p360_026|p360|My conscience is not clear.
p360_032|p360|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p360_224|p360|It just never comes together.
p360_230|p360|The characters are always the first attraction.
p360_218|p360|That's a big reduction.
p360_219|p360|There will be good prospects ahead.
p360_231|p360|We've got better players here.
p360_225|p360|The club has never won it.
p360_033|p360|It's something which is very important to me.
p360_027|p360|Is that it?
p360_147|p360|Our players are exhausted.
p360_153|p360|It was a moment of madness.
p360_184|p360|I did not see anything to begin with.
p360_190|p360|What could we do?
p360_379|p360|It meant a lot to us.
p360_423|p360|It's unfair on her.
p360_345|p360|How did it all come about?
p360_351|p360|The most important thing was to win today.
p360_386|p360|They are with their father.
p360_392|p360|It is a natural reaction.
p360_384|p360|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p360_390|p360|In football it is not always the case.
p360_347|p360|One was a lawyer.
p360_421|p360|There was no happy ending.
p360_353|p360|This is a moment to seize.
p360_409|p360|What's the problem with change?
p360_186|p360|I certainly do not agree with that.
p360_192|p360|But there was no going back.
p360_145|p360|What's it going to be then?
p360_151|p360|This has been carried out.
p360_179|p360|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p360_031|p360|There are two problems.
p360_025|p360|You can never take a win for granted.
p360_019|p360|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p360_233|p360|This is wonderful news.
p360_227|p360|So it was at Easter Road.
p360_226|p360|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p360_232|p360|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p360_018|p360|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p360_024|p360|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p360_030|p360|That depends on Rangers.
p360_178|p360|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p360_150|p360|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p360_144|p360|That was worth it.
p360_193|p360|There are some good people in there.
p360_187|p360|It was a disaster of a race.
p360_408|p360|What was all that about?
p360_352|p360|Golf is not like that.
p360_346|p360|We are working so hard.
p360_420|p360|Tiger is the exception.
p360_391|p360|Sometimes we find a person.
p360_385|p360|I didn't do it.
p360_309|p360|Have we not been here before?
p360_321|p360|He has yet to receive a reply.
p360_335|p360|That is a tragedy.
p360_123|p360|Britain has never had it so good.
p360_137|p360|The only safe investment is cash.
p360_094|p360|It's nice to be involved.
p360_080|p360|There was a definite prejudice.
p360_057|p360|It was very full anyway.
p360_043|p360|That has now gone.
p360_296|p360|I believe it will happen.
p360_282|p360|It was important to bring them all together.
p360_269|p360|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p360_255|p360|Who would have thought it?
p360_241|p360|It is all very upbeat.
p360_240|p360|And what happens?
p360_254|p360|It seems a shame to leave it.
p360_268|p360|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p360_283|p360|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p360_297|p360|And Michael was just great.
p360_042|p360|I have no intention of resigning today.
p360_056|p360|That view has not altered.
p360_081|p360|Nothing is going right at the moment.
p360_095|p360|It's not a game.
p360_136|p360|It is a fantasy.
p360_122|p360|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p360_334|p360|It will be up to the government.
p360_320|p360|You've got to have both sides.
p360_308|p360|We are not physical at all.
p360_336|p360|I am very happy.
p360_322|p360|It has been only average.
p360_108|p360|We opened up and everything was gone.
p360_134|p360|And this game is all about belief.
p360_120|p360|I'm not thinking about anyone else.
p360_083|p360|You will be very welcome.
p360_097|p360|There is much work to do.
p360_068|p360|Nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360_040|p360|It's not been a good year.
p360_054|p360|That will be important.
p360_281|p360|A press conference is about politics.
p360_295|p360|But it didn't bother me.
p360_242|p360|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p360_256|p360|They were all on a mission.
p360_257|p360|Human beings are always the same.
p360_243|p360|We're looking for unity in the council.
p360_294|p360|We are in it for the long-term.
p360_280|p360|The joint bid is still on course.
p360_055|p360|But here it is also very bad.
p360_041|p360|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
p360_069|p360|It was that kind of afternoon.
p360_096|p360|Buildings are about people.
p360_082|p360|We never publicise it.
p360_121|p360|They will run a mile.
p360_135|p360|I am ready for that.
p360_109|p360|It is looking very special.
p360_323|p360|He should be worried about me.
p360_337|p360|A child is not a product.
p360_333|p360|Pakistan denied the report.
p360_327|p360|That was the gimmick.
p360_131|p360|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p360_125|p360|It was all very good stuff.
p360_119|p360|I have spoken to head office.
p360_086|p360|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p360_092|p360|It was looking bad.
p360_045|p360|This will take up to nine months.
p360_051|p360|When he came to see me on Monday.
p360_079|p360|The voters rejected us.
p360_284|p360|They tend to be female and retired.
p360_290|p360|That is the key.
p360_247|p360|It's up to the defence team.
p360_253|p360|I didn't see the point.
p360_252|p360|But it was too late.
p360_246|p360|Just one of those things, we suppose.
p360_291|p360|We've been here before.
p360_285|p360|These things happen in football but shouldn't.
p360_078|p360|The question was simple enough.
p360_050|p360|It is like a football team.
p360_044|p360|Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360_093|p360|That's what makes it interesting.
p360_087|p360|It seems very odd.
p360_118|p360|He played it like a veteran.
p360_124|p360|So many people will be affected by this.
p360_130|p360|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p360_326|p360|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p360_332|p360|I don't think he played his best.
p360_324|p360|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p360_330|p360|I have no idea.
p360_318|p360|I have learned a lot.
p360_126|p360|Or was it?
p360_132|p360|I knew that we needed to get out.
p360_091|p360|I've always been very taken by the drink.
p360_085|p360|He became enchanted with the process.
p360_052|p360|That's a concern to me.
p360_046|p360|And maybe they have.
p360_293|p360|I have never been unemployed.
p360_287|p360|We know the fight is going to happen.
p360_250|p360|It is part of his game.
p360_244|p360|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p360_278|p360|The warning is timely.
p360_279|p360|Those were the days.
p360_245|p360|We deserved the draw.
p360_251|p360|Did he just want to be on telly?
p360_286|p360|It looks as though he will be right.
p360_292|p360|I am in a good position.
p360_047|p360|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p360_053|p360|She said she was really sorry.
p360_084|p360|His musicals were very much of their time.
p360_090|p360|We will continue to provide support for them.
p360_133|p360|I had a train to catch.
p360_127|p360|We are under no illusions about this.
p360_319|p360|It won't be their last.
p360_331|p360|This plan is all about respect.
p360_325|p360|For me, any manager is good.
p277_280|p277|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p277_294|p277|One was a lawyer.
p277_041|p277|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p277_055|p277|He is too weak to move.
p277_069|p277|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p277_082|p277|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p277_096|p277|They lived for their children.
p277_135|p277|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p277_121|p277|The mood is upbeat.
p277_109|p277|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p277_337|p277|That has been lost.
p277_451|p277|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p277_445|p277|The children are fine.
p277_323|p277|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p277_444|p277|I was lost.
p277_322|p277|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p277_336|p277|The performance was excellent.
p277_450|p277|It was a total disaster.
p277_108|p277|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p277_120|p277|It is so sad.
p277_134|p277|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p277_097|p277|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p277_083|p277|It is a job creation scheme.
p277_068|p277|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p277_054|p277|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p277_040|p277|They're just different.
p277_295|p277|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p277_281|p277|This is a national crisis.
p277_256|p277|This is a question of Islam.
p277_242|p277|I can't get a job.
p277_254|p277|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p277_240|p277|There's the mix.
p277_268|p277|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p277_297|p277|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p277_283|p277|Who did the recruiting?
p277_056|p277|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p277_042|p277|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p277_095|p277|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p277_081|p277|It was magic.
p277_122|p277|It is rubbish.
p277_136|p277|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p277_320|p277|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p277_446|p277|They have to come up with a solution.
p277_452|p277|I got a yellow card.
p277_334|p277|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p277_308|p277|My body is clearly capable.
p277_309|p277|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p277_453|p277|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
p277_335|p277|He loves the big occasions.
p277_321|p277|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p277_447|p277|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p277_137|p277|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p277_123|p277|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p277_080|p277|He was at home with his pals.
p277_094|p277|It is a blow.
p277_043|p277|Indeed, he does.
p277_057|p277|He looks like an Afghan.
p277_282|p277|It was good.
p277_296|p277|They are wrong.
p277_269|p277|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p277_241|p277|The concerns are the same.
p277_255|p277|We shall rely on human beings.
p277_279|p277|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p277_251|p277|Souter will be back.
p277_245|p277|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p277_292|p277|Nothing is safe.
p277_286|p277|The goals will come.
p277_053|p277|Is a drug dealer?
p277_047|p277|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p277_090|p277|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p277_084|p277|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p277_127|p277|I can't even get into the A team.
p277_133|p277|The BBC was a disgrace.
p277_319|p277|Is that an issue?
p277_443|p277|Who would be in that desert?
p277_325|p277|Well, it won't.
p277_331|p277|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p277_457|p277|It is a vicious circle.
p277_330|p277|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p277_456|p277|If they don't, they should say so.
p277_442|p277|I hate the word.
p277_324|p277|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p277_318|p277|I was invited to work in Germany.
p277_132|p277|No production was achieved.
p277_126|p277|There were no grounds for his action.
p277_085|p277|Even the one she loved.
p277_091|p277|Someone who cares
p277_046|p277|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p277_052|p277|They said she was stable.
p277_287|p277|There's a pause.
p277_293|p277|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p277_244|p277|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p277_250|p277|They must play for each other.
p277_278|p277|It was a virus.
p277_246|p277|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p277_252|p277|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p277_285|p277|The songs are just so good.
p277_291|p277|I was brought up in a mining background.
p277_078|p277|Painful, but only because it's true.
p277_044|p277|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p277_050|p277|This represents a tough game for us.
p277_087|p277|He is in the queue.
p277_093|p277|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p277_118|p277|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p277_130|p277|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p277_124|p277|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p277_454|p277|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
p277_332|p277|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p277_326|p277|These days are long gone.
p277_440|p277|And it showed.
p277_327|p277|Two people were interviewed.
p277_441|p277|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p277_455|p277|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p277_333|p277|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p277_125|p277|Who would have?
p277_131|p277|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p277_119|p277|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p277_092|p277|By then, he was walking on water.
p277_086|p277|Today she has been released.
p277_051|p277|It is bizarre.
p277_045|p277|He's just in it for himself.
p277_079|p277|I had my suspicions.
p277_290|p277|What has altered?
p277_284|p277|Bombing slaughter rejected
p277_253|p277|Blood samples were taken.
p277_220|p277|They must do it.
p277_234|p277|It is hard won.
p277_208|p277|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p277_022|p277|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p277_036|p277|Was it worth it?
p277_156|p277|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p277_142|p277|We want to keep the pound.
p277_195|p277|But she might be.
p277_181|p277|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p277_432|p277|It's been a long, long journey.
p277_354|p277|Not so, it seems.
p277_340|p277|She said they would appeal.
p277_426|p277|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
p277_368|p277|He was the architect.
p277_397|p277|It will take place in July.
p277_383|p277|Yet the data is compelling.
p277_382|p277|At the last I found a bunker.
p277_396|p277|The car was just there.
p277_369|p277|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p277_341|p277|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p277_427|p277|I know the worry over Iraq.
p277_433|p277|We were used.
p277_355|p277|He could make it.
p277_180|p277|They need to look after themselves.
p277_194|p277|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p277_143|p277|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p277_157|p277|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p277_037|p277|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p277_023|p277|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p277_209|p277|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p277_235|p277|Our policy is clear.
p277_221|p277|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277_237|p277|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p277_223|p277|Until they came to do it.
p277_035|p277|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p277_021|p277|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p277_009|p277|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p277_141|p277|I had decided to quit the show.
p277_155|p277|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p277_169|p277|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p277_182|p277|What has caused the demise of singing?
p277_196|p277|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p277_425|p277|It all began as an accident.
p277_343|p277|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p277_357|p277|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p277_431|p277|We are all equal.
p277_419|p277|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p277_380|p277|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p277_394|p277|It was a kind of contempt.
p277_395|p277|It was a breathtaking moment.
p277_381|p277|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p277_418|p277|It is legally binding.
p277_356|p277|Four policemen were wounded.
p277_430|p277|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p277_424|p277|It was little else.
p277_342|p277|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p277_197|p277|It was worth a photograph.
p277_183|p277|Our team is just so young.
p277_168|p277|We've all had the shots.
p277_154|p277|I was so nervous.
p277_140|p277|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p277_008|p277|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p277_020|p277|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p277_034|p277|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p277_222|p277|However, no further action was taken by police.
p277_236|p277|The scene is about this?
p277_232|p277|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p277_226|p277|There is no excuse.
p277_018|p277|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p277_030|p277|There's a story, too.
p277_024|p277|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p277_178|p277|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p277_144|p277|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p277_150|p277|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p277_187|p277|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p277_193|p277|Tommy is not a problem.
p277_408|p277|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p277_346|p277|As, indeed, they would be.
p277_420|p277|There's been a mistake.
p277_434|p277|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p277_352|p277|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p277_385|p277|It's a real problem.
p277_391|p277|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p277_390|p277|It's like a basketball.
p277_384|p277|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p277_435|p277|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p277_353|p277|There was a substantial explosion.
p277_347|p277|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p277_421|p277|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p277_409|p277|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p277_192|p277|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p277_186|p277|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p277_151|p277|So I got a blood test.
p277_145|p277|Who would be right?
p277_179|p277|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p277_025|p277|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p277_031|p277|This is the window.
p277_019|p277|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p277_233|p277|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p277_219|p277|At the time, he was a living legend.
p277_225|p277|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p277_231|p277|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p277_027|p277|They have no history.
p277_033|p277|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p277_153|p277|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p277_147|p277|He realises his mistake.
p277_190|p277|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p277_184|p277|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p277_379|p277|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p277_351|p277|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p277_437|p277|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p277_423|p277|I am extremely cautious.
p277_392|p277|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p277_386|p277|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p277_387|p277|I was in the train station overnight.
p277_393|p277|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p277_422|p277|Eriksson would have approved.
p277_344|p277|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p277_350|p277|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p277_436|p277|They were not even allowed to see them.
p277_378|p277|That's the name of the game, though.
p277_185|p277|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p277_191|p277|We believe a third party was involved.
p277_146|p277|She died at her home.
p277_152|p277|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p277_032|p277|He was jailed for five years.
p277_026|p277|Is this accurate?
p277_230|p277|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p277_224|p277|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p277_218|p277|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p277_201|p277|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p277_215|p277|It's not before time.
p277_229|p277|But it's a subtle process.
p277_003|p277|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p277_017|p277|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p277_177|p277|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p277_163|p277|It is so unfair.
p277_188|p277|Peace was won.
p277_413|p277|went on sale.
p277_375|p277|Something is wrong.
p277_361|p277|They have not done so this season so far.
p277_407|p277|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p277_349|p277|We will be homeless.
p277_348|p277|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p277_360|p277|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p277_406|p277|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p277_412|p277|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p277_374|p277|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p277_189|p277|It's a fact.
p277_162|p277|Well, he should know.
p277_176|p277|Tony had arrived.
p277_016|p277|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p277_002|p277|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p277_228|p277|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p277_214|p277|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p277_200|p277|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p277_216|p277|The report is due out next month.
p277_202|p277|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p277_014|p277|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p277_028|p277|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p277_160|p277|My Dad is a hero.
p277_174|p277|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p277_148|p277|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p277_404|p277|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p277_362|p277|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p277_376|p277|You can cope with it.
p277_410|p277|Feel the air, the space.
p277_438|p277|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p277_389|p277|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p277_439|p277|It won the match.
p277_377|p277|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p277_411|p277|He got his degree.
p277_405|p277|It is an absolute nonsense.
p277_363|p277|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p277_149|p277|It is not just about pay.
p277_175|p277|As we worked.
p277_161|p277|He can do no wrong.
p277_029|p277|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p277_015|p277|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p277_203|p277|Twaddle is a case in point.
p277_217|p277|But she was.
p277_213|p277|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p277_207|p277|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p277_039|p277|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p277_011|p277|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p277_005|p277|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p277_159|p277|They should come clean.
p277_165|p277|I've put my own money into this project.
p277_171|p277|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p277_429|p277|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p277_367|p277|It was a funny game.
p277_401|p277|What was the difference between them?
p277_415|p277|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p277_373|p277|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p277_398|p277|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p277_399|p277|Is that possible?
p277_414|p277|But we finished the show.
p277_372|p277|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p277_366|p277|There is no signature.
p277_400|p277|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p277_428|p277|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p277_170|p277|Again, we were lucky.
p277_164|p277|I will tell you.
p277_158|p277|We are on a four-year mission.
p277_004|p277|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p277_010|p277|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p277_038|p277|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p277_206|p277|In each case they were a goal down.
p277_212|p277|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p277_238|p277|There wasn't a goal.
p277_204|p277|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p277_210|p277|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p277_006|p277|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p277_012|p277|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p277_172|p277|Does that put pressure on us?
p277_166|p277|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p277_199|p277|We have an election in eight days.
p277_358|p277|It's now down in black and white.
p277_370|p277|I've never seen a game like it.
p277_416|p277|The people around me were fantastic.
p277_402|p277|Emotions were complex.
p277_364|p277|So there, we won.
p277_403|p277|Then , he laughs.
p277_365|p277|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p277_371|p277|I am a wealthy person.
p277_417|p277|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p277_359|p277|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p277_198|p277|They make a selective perception process.
p277_167|p277|It is not like us.
p277_173|p277|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p277_013|p277|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p277_007|p277|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p277_211|p277|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p277_205|p277|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p277_239|p277|I should think so, too.
p277_262|p277|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p277_276|p277|Dialogue is the key.
p277_289|p277|I was the sheep.
p277_060|p277|It had been in place since last July.
p277_074|p277|But I've won both ways.
p277_048|p277|We will push.
p277_114|p277|She reflects a bit.
p277_100|p277|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p277_128|p277|I'm so angry.
p277_316|p277|Off with their heads.
p277_302|p277|We want to play at the worlds.
p277_458|p277|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p277_459|p277|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p277_303|p277|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p277_317|p277|Is there a new way forward?
p277_129|p277|She really suffered for her art.
p277_101|p277|It was clear.
p277_115|p277|I am just trying to do my job.
p277_049|p277|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p277_075|p277|There was an e-mail.
p277_061|p277|Next league matches Celtic.
p277_288|p277|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p277_277|p277|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p277_263|p277|We're in shock.
p277_275|p277|All options are open.
p277_261|p277|The system can work.
p277_249|p277|This is the first step.
p277_077|p277|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p277_063|p277|It is unique.
p277_088|p277|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p277_103|p277|But I was wrong.
p277_117|p277|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p277_301|p277|The letters are going out today.
p277_315|p277|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p277_329|p277|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p277_328|p277|I've got no secret.
p277_314|p277|It's too horrible to think.
p277_300|p277|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p277_116|p277|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p277_102|p277|It is annoying.
p277_089|p277|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277_062|p277|There was no safety net.
p277_076|p277|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p277_248|p277|Is that a serious question?
p277_260|p277|He was also married with two children.
p277_274|p277|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p277_258|p277|Immediate action must be taken.
p277_270|p277|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p277_264|p277|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p277_072|p277|That was a gold medal for certain.
p277_066|p277|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p277_099|p277|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p277_106|p277|Our position remains unchanged.
p277_112|p277|Two of the team became ill.
p277_338|p277|Tell us about it.
p277_462|p277|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p277_304|p277|My whole life has changed.
p277_310|p277|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p277_311|p277|A review is under way.
p277_463|p277|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p277_305|p277|We are a peaceful people.
p277_339|p277|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p277_113|p277|He takes the job.
p277_107|p277|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p277_098|p277|Today I couldn't run on it.
p277_067|p277|I feel I did not have enough time.
p277_073|p277|He was popular.
p277_265|p277|It's a way of life.
p277_271|p277|If not, he should go home.
p277_259|p277|It's very nice.
p277_267|p277|It was very fast.
p277_273|p277|He looked very sharp.
p277_298|p277|The plot is minimal.
p277_059|p277|Here's a clue.
p277_065|p277|They are ready.
p277_071|p277|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p277_139|p277|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p277_111|p277|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p277_105|p277|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p277_449|p277|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p277_313|p277|I came into this world with nothing.
p277_307|p277|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p277_461|p277|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p277_306|p277|You may have a short memory.
p277_460|p277|I'd love to be like Peter.
p277_312|p277|It will work.
p277_448|p277|The whole region is in shock.
p277_104|p277|I love the Dome.
p277_110|p277|You should be.
p277_138|p277|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p277_070|p277|They are real.
p277_064|p277|That's the truth.
p277_058|p277|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p277_299|p277|You are the glory.
p277_272|p277|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p277_266|p277|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p283_281|p283|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p283_295|p283|We accept the new rules.
p283_040|p283|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p283_054|p283|I had come back from London.
p283_068|p283|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p283_083|p283|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p283_097|p283|The trick is to try it.
p283_134|p283|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p283_120|p283|There is no credible official announcement.
p283_108|p283|So what is the campaign about?
p283_336|p283|Well, he can do it.
p283_450|p283|We went straight into the bedroom.
p283_444|p283|Everything in golf is a balance.
p283_322|p283|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p283_445|p283|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p283_323|p283|The Project is far from that.
p283_337|p283|The songs are just so good.
p283_451|p283|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
p283_109|p283|And does it?
p283_121|p283|Our house was very small.
p283_135|p283|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p283_096|p283|Potions said he would drive.
p283_082|p283|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p283_069|p283|We believe a third party was involved.
p283_055|p283|I was inspired by two things.
p283_041|p283|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p283_294|p283|I told you I was ill.
p283_280|p283|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p283_257|p283|We played them off the pitch.
p283_243|p283|I'm just a regular person.
p283_255|p283|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p283_241|p283|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p283_269|p283|was everything done to save people?
p283_296|p283|He looked like a schoolboy.
p283_282|p283|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p283_057|p283|There was no safety net.
p283_043|p283|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p283_094|p283|It's so hard to shift.
p283_080|p283|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p283_123|p283|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p283_137|p283|This should begin in October.
p283_321|p283|This is the correct decision.
p283_447|p283|Something has got to give.
p283_453|p283|I was embarrassed by it.
p283_335|p283|I was there five months ago.
p283_309|p283|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p283_308|p283|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p283_452|p283|But we have built a platform for next season.
p283_334|p283|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p283_320|p283|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p283_446|p283|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p283_136|p283|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p283_122|p283|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p283_081|p283|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p283_095|p283|They lived for their children.
p283_042|p283|The boy is no longer with us.
p283_056|p283|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p283_283|p283|Nato was not a love affair.
p283_297|p283|They are very keen to work with us.
p283_268|p283|And they were being paid?
p283_240|p283|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p283_254|p283|Our future is in their hands.
p283_278|p283|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p283_250|p283|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p283_244|p283|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p283_293|p283|None of the agencies was able to help.
p283_287|p283|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p283_052|p283|I would say the position is open.
p283_046|p283|I was released after six days.
p283_091|p283|He has been a success this year.
p283_085|p283|The result is a vacuum.
p283_126|p283|It was won on the issue of the land.
p283_132|p283|We would make a start.
p283_318|p283|If not, he should go home.
p283_442|p283|We shall not forget him.
p283_324|p283|What form did that take?
p283_330|p283|He will address the nation this evening.
p283_456|p283|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p283_331|p283|The attacker died in the crash.
p283_457|p283|I'd never run for them.
p283_443|p283|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
p283_319|p283|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p283_133|p283|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p283_127|p283|I am a committed European.
p283_084|p283|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p283_090|p283|You have to respect the office.
p283_047|p283|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p283_053|p283|That was the theory, anyway.
p283_286|p283|Persuaded to change his mind.
p283_292|p283|My office is down there.
p283_245|p283|It was a great experience.
p283_251|p283|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
p283_279|p283|The minister is the engineer.
p283_247|p283|These will take a little time to develop.
p283_253|p283|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p283_284|p283|You can never tell with the manager.
p283_290|p283|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p283_079|p283|It is very special for me.
p283_045|p283|Among them are many criminals.
p283_051|p283|It also opened a branch in Livingston.
p283_086|p283|It looks like a hit.
p283_092|p283|By then, he was walking on water.
p283_119|p283|It's been a long wait.
p283_131|p283|It is a delight on every level.
p283_125|p283|Sport is good for you.
p283_469|p283|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
p283_455|p283|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p283_333|p283|No final decision has been taken.
p283_327|p283|Is there a waiting list?
p283_441|p283|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p283_326|p283|What are they for?
p283_440|p283|Which may be the same thing.
p283_454|p283|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p283_332|p283|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p283_468|p283|We are going through the process.
p283_124|p283|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p283_130|p283|That might help a bit.
p283_118|p283|There were no grounds for his action.
p283_093|p283|We have to offer value for money.
p283_087|p283|I'd like to see the business case.
p283_050|p283|Clearly, they had other problems.
p283_044|p283|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p283_078|p283|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p283_291|p283|I should think so, too.
p283_285|p283|We need to establish the facts.
p283_252|p283|It was a crazy day.
p283_246|p283|His second was a beauty.
p283_221|p283|They are still very quiet.
p283_235|p283|This will take several weeks.
p283_209|p283|She was married with one son.
p283_023|p283|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p283_037|p283|That means an extra two years.
p283_157|p283|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p283_143|p283|You've got to be vigilant.
p283_194|p283|It was to be inclusive.
p283_180|p283|They should stop the bombing.
p283_433|p283|I would rather look at him.
p283_341|p283|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p283_427|p283|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p283_369|p283|Last weekend he was awful.
p283_396|p283|This is a club on the rise.
p283_382|p283|What do they want us to do?
p283_383|p283|Is it worth it?
p283_397|p283|We came across the first set of bodies.
p283_368|p283|I have a moral dilemma.
p283_340|p283|A new school will be built.
p283_426|p283|No date has been set for a meeting.
p283_432|p283|He is on the wrong side.
p283_354|p283|My life is exactly the same.
p283_181|p283|The research was my life.
p283_195|p283|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p283_142|p283|Last night, the row continued.
p283_156|p283|I am just trying to do my job.
p283_036|p283|It is not for any other purpose.
p283_022|p283|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p283_208|p283|They bought the property four years ago.
p283_234|p283|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p283_220|p283|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p283_236|p283|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p283_222|p283|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p283_034|p283|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p283_020|p283|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p283_008|p283|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p283_140|p283|If not, a deal could take many months.
p283_154|p283|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p283_168|p283|What do we want to do that for?
p283_183|p283|The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
p283_197|p283|The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p283_424|p283|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p283_342|p283|The capital costs are modest.
p283_356|p283|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p283_430|p283|My aim is a top six finish.
p283_418|p283|That's all I can say.
p283_381|p283|Had this been common practice?
p283_395|p283|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p283_394|p283|As, indeed, they would be.
p283_380|p283|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p283_419|p283|How do you take them away?
p283_357|p283|We want to play at the worlds.
p283_431|p283|These guys are looking for business.
p283_425|p283|Yet the data is compelling.
p283_343|p283|It became a book by itself.
p283_196|p283|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p283_182|p283|I'd love to be like Peter.
p283_169|p283|It has to be an event.
p283_155|p283|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p283_141|p283|But it is different in different regions.
p283_009|p283|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p283_021|p283|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p283_035|p283|It could well be the case.
p283_223|p283|I came home by ambulance.
p283_237|p283|We have an election in eight days.
p283_233|p283|This is a holy place.
p283_227|p283|I suggest a new plan.
p283_019|p283|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p283_031|p283|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p283_025|p283|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p283_179|p283|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p283_145|p283|We are entirely happy with Russell.
p283_151|p283|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p283_186|p283|It's never great to finish second.
p283_192|p283|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p283_409|p283|Colour was at the core of his life.
p283_347|p283|But I think it's different from the rest!
p283_421|p283|After the match, do you?
p283_435|p283|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p283_353|p283|And he goes with it.
p283_384|p283|Does it matter?
p283_390|p283|It's as wide as a church in here.
p283_391|p283|It would be quite nice.
p283_385|p283|That can be good for us.
p283_434|p283|It needs to be volatile.
p283_352|p283|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
p283_346|p283|The party lasted all night.
p283_420|p283|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p283_408|p283|It proved a good decision.
p283_193|p283|There was no hint of scandal.
p283_187|p283|We have a budget in March.
p283_150|p283|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p283_144|p283|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p283_178|p283|The woman was his wife.
p283_024|p283|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p283_030|p283|And we have a singer.
p283_018|p283|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p283_226|p283|You could feel the heat.
p283_232|p283|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p283_218|p283|We represent a wide range of society.
p283_224|p283|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p283_230|p283|The early physical reports were clear.
p283_026|p283|We are a service industry.
p283_032|p283|We speak about the performance.
p283_152|p283|I'm so grateful for that.
p283_146|p283|It's not a U-turn at all.
p283_191|p283|It's nice to be nice.
p283_185|p283|He was in great spirits.
p283_378|p283|He had no previous convictions.
p283_350|p283|They come to enjoy themselves.
p283_436|p283|It is based on a true story.
p283_422|p283|I am astonished at attack.
p283_344|p283|Cast Away now on general release.
p283_393|p283|The pair are very much in love.
p283_387|p283|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
p283_386|p283|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p283_392|p283|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p283_423|p283|I was pleased with my own game.
p283_345|p283|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p283_351|p283|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p283_437|p283|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p283_379|p283|He was then replaced by Ross.
p283_184|p283|I am a good player.
p283_190|p283|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p283_147|p283|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p283_153|p283|It will be retained as part of the group.
p283_033|p283|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p283_027|p283|It's not going to work out that way.
p283_231|p283|Consumers have the right to choose.
p283_225|p283|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p283_219|p283|We always felt we could win.
p283_200|p283|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p283_214|p283|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p283_228|p283|That is the real test.
p283_002|p283|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p283_016|p283|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p283_176|p283|He was asked to quit.
p283_162|p283|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p283_189|p283|Nobody did in those days.
p283_412|p283|But the foundations have been laid.
p283_374|p283|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p283_360|p283|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p283_406|p283|That investment has now been secured.
p283_348|p283|It is a matter of clarity.
p283_349|p283|He did that every night I was with him.
p283_361|p283|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p283_407|p283|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p283_413|p283|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
p283_375|p283|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p283_188|p283|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p283_163|p283|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p283_177|p283|There is no reason at all.
p283_017|p283|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p283_003|p283|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p283_229|p283|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p283_215|p283|It was a bit like having children.
p283_201|p283|Does the name matter?
p283_217|p283|I will work on her.
p283_203|p283|What are you not good at?
p283_015|p283|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p283_001|p283|Please call Stella.  
p283_029|p283|Because we do not need it.
p283_161|p283|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p283_175|p283|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p283_149|p283|Before it was an ordeal.
p283_405|p283|There is a lack of logic.
p283_363|p283|They were impressive against France.
p283_377|p283|I said she was very young.
p283_411|p283|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p283_439|p283|He will be judged by his actions.
p283_388|p283|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p283_389|p283|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p283_438|p283|Being with me is an honour.
p283_376|p283|It should be a great game, though.
p283_410|p283|The BBC was a disgrace.
p283_404|p283|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p283_362|p283|In the old days, it was easy.
p283_148|p283|He was a home referee.
p283_174|p283|My Dad is a hero.
p283_160|p283|This will secure the future of our industry.
p283_028|p283|The idea is not new.
p283_014|p283|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p283_202|p283|how do you get it back?
p283_216|p283|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p283_212|p283|We are not making any comment.
p283_206|p283|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p283_038|p283|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p283_010|p283|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p283_004|p283|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p283_158|p283|It has become a way of life.
p283_164|p283|What happened in that game?
p283_170|p283|Three hours later, the man was free.
p283_428|p283|That is a personal matter.
p283_366|p283|He was at school in Devon.
p283_400|p283|Final proposals will be published in February.
p283_414|p283|I was shaking on the blocks.
p283_372|p283|Ferguson is a good example.
p283_399|p283|It has only been rumours.
p283_398|p283|Theatre is not a museum.
p283_415|p283|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p283_373|p283|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p283_367|p283|I'd like to take the plunge.
p283_401|p283|I could not live with it.
p283_429|p283|I'm pleased about one thing.
p283_171|p283|We have a clean bill of health.
p283_165|p283|Are you going to win?
p283_159|p283|I was caught out a little bit.
p283_005|p283|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p283_011|p283|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p283_039|p283|He is believed to live in Britain.
p283_207|p283|They receive a high profile in the media.
p283_213|p283|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p283_239|p283|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p283_205|p283|Who was she?
p283_211|p283|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
p283_007|p283|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p283_013|p283|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p283_173|p283|Today I had no failures in my team.
p283_167|p283|Why change it?
p283_198|p283|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p283_359|p283|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p283_371|p283|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p283_417|p283|The second goal was superb.
p283_403|p283|A review is under way.
p283_365|p283|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p283_402|p283|The death rates are still as high.
p283_364|p283|The airport was even different.
p283_370|p283|There is a range of employers.
p283_416|p283|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p283_358|p283|We will listen to any suggestion.
p283_199|p283|The hotel was now for sale.
p283_166|p283|Was it the wife?
p283_172|p283|It was by the numbers.
p283_012|p283|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p283_006|p283|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p283_210|p283|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p283_204|p283|I think, therefore I am?
p283_238|p283|January is a bad time of year.
p283_263|p283|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p283_277|p283|I would do away with the dress code.
p283_288|p283|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p283_061|p283|Do I have a favourite?
p283_075|p283|We will pay their bills.
p283_049|p283|No details of the talks were given.
p283_115|p283|We made a world record together.
p283_101|p283|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p283_129|p283|That was the first step.
p283_317|p283|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p283_471|p283|It's been a long, long journey.
p283_465|p283|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p283_303|p283|It is the end of an adventure.
p283_459|p283|He was confronted by police.
p283_458|p283|She came to the Highland Show.
p283_464|p283|She has now been registered as disabled.
p283_302|p283|At first I thought I was gone.
p283_316|p283|We have to be very, very careful.
p283_470|p283|City sentiment is in his favour.
p283_128|p283|From it emerged a cup.
p283_100|p283|It really was an unusual award.
p283_114|p283|Their attitude is all wrong.
p283_048|p283|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p283_074|p283|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p283_060|p283|So is that it, then?
p283_289|p283|My son was too young to die.
p283_276|p283|The irony was not lost.
p283_262|p283|They have not been in touch with the club.
p283_274|p283|That takes a lot of courage.
p283_260|p283|At the time, he was a living legend.
p283_248|p283|There's a chance they might come down.
p283_076|p283|He is a young man with a new deal.
p283_062|p283|What do we do?
p283_089|p283|I've had it for the exams.
p283_102|p283|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p283_116|p283|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p283_300|p283|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p283_466|p283|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p283_314|p283|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p283_328|p283|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p283_329|p283|So what happens next?
p283_315|p283|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p283_301|p283|This is a total mystery.
p283_467|p283|It all began as an accident.
p283_117|p283|It's for that reason he should resign.
p283_103|p283|We could not get any possession.
p283_088|p283|It makes for an interesting conference.
p283_063|p283|He also presented You Bet!
p283_077|p283|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p283_249|p283|This is an exciting time for the party.
p283_261|p283|My wife and family are the support system.
p283_275|p283|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p283_259|p283|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p283_271|p283|Do I think about them often?
p283_265|p283|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p283_073|p283|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p283_067|p283|This is the year of the Tiger.
p283_098|p283|Little is known about them.
p283_107|p283|So, did she meet him?
p283_113|p283|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p283_339|p283|We need to increase the membership.
p283_463|p283|This morning I got a call from my wife.
p283_305|p283|It looks as though he will be right.
p283_311|p283|It was never a free kick.
p283_310|p283|My whole life has changed.
p283_462|p283|Let that be their memorial.
p283_304|p283|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p283_338|p283|And it's a goodbye from him.
p283_112|p283|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p283_106|p283|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p283_099|p283|However, it did not end that way.
p283_066|p283|We felt it was sufficient.
p283_072|p283|You do not change overnight.
p283_264|p283|She claimed the day was for young people.
p283_270|p283|What was the matter for concern?
p283_258|p283|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p283_266|p283|It had so much to do with output.
p283_272|p283|Is it in the right place?
p283_299|p283|The next month is very important.
p283_058|p283|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p283_064|p283|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p283_070|p283|The Government should be ashamed.
p283_138|p283|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p283_110|p283|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p283_104|p283|That is the important thing.
p283_448|p283|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p283_312|p283|It further expressed his defiance.
p283_306|p283|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p283_460|p283|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p283_307|p283|It was an easy decision to come here.
p283_461|p283|She has reached the top of her profession.
p283_313|p283|He said he was sorry.
p283_449|p283|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
p283_105|p283|Why do it otherwise?
p283_111|p283|It's good to have a voice.
p283_139|p283|We did what we had to do.
p283_071|p283|There's still plenty time left.
p283_065|p283|I expect a rapid response.
p283_059|p283|How are you, sir?
p283_298|p283|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p283_273|p283|Did he trip?
p283_267|p283|She died in middle age.
p248_134|p248|Our intentions are real.
p248_322|p248|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p248_336|p248|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p248_256|p248|they fail to engage.
p248_242|p248|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p248_295|p248|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p248_281|p248|He will address the nation this evening.
p248_068|p248|It's good news and long overdue.
p248_054|p248|They had to explain it.
p248_040|p248|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p248_097|p248|I had a ball today.
p248_083|p248|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p248_082|p248|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p248_096|p248|It is a delight on every level.
p248_041|p248|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p248_055|p248|Here's a clue.
p248_069|p248|Have a look at our accounts.
p248_280|p248|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p248_294|p248|Our task is to complete the picture.
p248_243|p248|She is well balanced.
p248_257|p248|They are real.
p248_337|p248|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p248_323|p248|Who will do it?
p248_135|p248|Government will intervene.
p248_121|p248|She's got to say something.
p248_109|p248|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p248_137|p248|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p248_123|p248|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p248_309|p248|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p248_335|p248|The composer will conduct.
p248_321|p248|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p248_269|p248|Immediate action must be taken.
p248_241|p248|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p248_255|p248|Kirkwood was arrested.
p248_282|p248|It was a virus.
p248_296|p248|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p248_043|p248|It was ugly.
p248_057|p248|Next league matches Celtic.
p248_080|p248|It may well have been.
p248_094|p248|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p248_095|p248|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p248_081|p248|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p248_056|p248|But the law is very clear on this.
p248_042|p248|I was scared.
p248_297|p248|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p248_283|p248|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p248_254|p248|We run within the law.
p248_240|p248|My future is in the marathon.
p248_268|p248|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p248_320|p248|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p248_334|p248|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p248_308|p248|Craig is a major concern for us.
p248_122|p248|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p248_136|p248|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p248_132|p248|It's the big omission.
p248_126|p248|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p248_330|p248|Indeed, it was magical.
p248_324|p248|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p248_318|p248|I saw some good things.
p248_244|p248|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p248_250|p248|It was a hit.
p248_278|p248|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p248_287|p248|It is not normal practice.
p248_293|p248|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p248_046|p248|No meaningful response was issued.
p248_052|p248|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p248_085|p248|By then, he was walking on water.
p248_091|p248|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p248_090|p248|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p248_084|p248|We have other options.
p248_053|p248|He looks like an Afghan.
p248_047|p248|It is urgent.
p248_292|p248|I thought it was my only chance.
p248_286|p248|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p248_279|p248|You've got to have both sides.
p248_251|p248|This year I understood.
p248_245|p248|It is hard won.
p248_319|p248|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p248_325|p248|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p248_331|p248|There's no place to hide.
p248_127|p248|So the European elections are extremely important.
p248_133|p248|It plans to return to this field.
p248_125|p248|She does not want to speak.
p248_131|p248|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p248_119|p248|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p248_327|p248|The train was on time.
p248_333|p248|I said that I had been raped.
p248_253|p248|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p248_247|p248|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p248_290|p248|IT S all in the hair.
p248_284|p248|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p248_051|p248|But it might have done.
p248_045|p248|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p248_079|p248|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p248_092|p248|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p248_086|p248|It's never too late.
p248_087|p248|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p248_093|p248|He was possessed
p248_078|p248|Today she has been released.
p248_044|p248|That is a break with tradition.
p248_050|p248|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p248_285|p248|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p248_291|p248|What has altered?
p248_246|p248|The scene is about this?
p248_252|p248|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p248_332|p248|It will be very, very tight.
p248_326|p248|This is the way things should be handled.
p248_118|p248|But the fans deserve to know!
p248_130|p248|I had relied on him.
p248_124|p248|I can't even get into the A team.
p248_143|p248|It's a crucial award.
p248_157|p248|They should stop the bombing.
p248_180|p248|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p248_194|p248|However, this idea is never developed.
p248_369|p248|There is no signature.
p248_341|p248|I'd like to take the plunge.
p248_355|p248|That would help.
p248_209|p248|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p248_235|p248|I haven't made the donation yet.
p248_221|p248|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p248_037|p248|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p248_023|p248|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p248_022|p248|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p248_036|p248|It's a matter of balance.
p248_220|p248|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p248_234|p248|They should come forward.
p248_208|p248|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p248_354|p248|It was that bad, that low.
p248_340|p248|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p248_368|p248|Five members were disciplined.
p248_195|p248|It wasn't to be.
p248_181|p248|The goals were good.
p248_156|p248|That includes the equipment?
p248_142|p248|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p248_168|p248|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p248_154|p248|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p248_140|p248|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p248_197|p248|It's the same old story.
p248_183|p248|Four policemen were wounded.
p248_356|p248|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p248_342|p248|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p248_222|p248|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p248_236|p248|It's very safe.
p248_008|p248|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p248_020|p248|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p248_034|p248|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p248_035|p248|I expected these kind of questions.
p248_021|p248|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p248_009|p248|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p248_237|p248|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p248_223|p248|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p248_343|p248|It is horrible.
p248_357|p248|Who was the mystery MP?
p248_182|p248|I've been there.
p248_196|p248|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p248_141|p248|He has the edge.
p248_155|p248|They were later discharged from hospital.
p248_169|p248|The post will be unpaid.
p248_151|p248|It is huge.
p248_145|p248|There is a lack of chemistry.
p248_179|p248|Tony had arrived.
p248_192|p248|All options are open.
p248_186|p248|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p248_353|p248|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p248_347|p248|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p248_227|p248|The track is currently covered in snow.
p248_233|p248|It is set in Paris.
p248_025|p248|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p248_031|p248|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p248_019|p248|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p248_018|p248|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p248_030|p248|I have a theory.
p248_024|p248|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p248_232|p248|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p248_226|p248|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p248_346|p248|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p248_352|p248|He has seen the past.
p248_187|p248|They need to look after themselves.
p248_193|p248|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p248_178|p248|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p248_144|p248|He is severe.
p248_150|p248|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p248_146|p248|This film will be totally awesome.
p248_152|p248|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p248_185|p248|We did everything by the book.
p248_191|p248|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p248_344|p248|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p248_350|p248|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p248_230|p248|It's the same as Glasgow.
p248_224|p248|It was good fun.
p248_218|p248|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p248_032|p248|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p248_026|p248|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p248_027|p248|But it failed.
p248_033|p248|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p248_219|p248|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p248_225|p248|I have spoken to the skipper.
p248_231|p248|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p248_351|p248|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p248_345|p248|I kept going for her.
p248_190|p248|I cannot say too much about them.
p248_184|p248|They receive a high profile in the media.
p248_153|p248|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p248_147|p248|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p248_162|p248|It has to be now.
p248_176|p248|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p248_189|p248|You know the sort of thing.
p248_348|p248|But nothing happened.
p248_360|p248|He could face a jail sentence.
p248_374|p248|He's a lovely young man.
p248_228|p248|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p248_214|p248|It had all been arranged.
p248_200|p248|The service from the other players was super.
p248_016|p248|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p248_002|p248|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p248_003|p248|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p248_017|p248|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p248_201|p248|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p248_215|p248|In each case they were a goal down.
p248_229|p248|At the time, he was a living legend.
p248_375|p248|The casualties were not named.
p248_361|p248|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p248_349|p248|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p248_188|p248|What has caused the demise of singing?
p248_177|p248|And I saw the light!
p248_163|p248|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p248_149|p248|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p248_175|p248|Blair's response was weak.
p248_161|p248|Eight months later, he was dead.
p248_363|p248|They have not done so this season so far.
p248_203|p248|It's just awful.
p248_217|p248|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p248_029|p248|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p248_001|p248|Please call Stella.  
p248_015|p248|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p248_014|p248|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p248_028|p248|That's no bad thing.
p248_216|p248|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p248_202|p248|But she might be.
p248_362|p248|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p248_376|p248|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p248_160|p248|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p248_174|p248|The jury is still out.
p248_148|p248|It is like a football team.
p248_170|p248|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p248_164|p248|I was in the train station overnight.
p248_158|p248|That's the name of the game, though.
p248_372|p248|Colour was at the core of his life.
p248_366|p248|It is legally binding.
p248_206|p248|We have an election in eight days.
p248_212|p248|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p248_004|p248|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p248_010|p248|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p248_038|p248|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p248_039|p248|It was clear.
p248_011|p248|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p248_005|p248|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p248_213|p248|Twaddle is a case in point.
p248_207|p248|Now, it's all right.
p248_367|p248|Well, the big day has arrived.
p248_373|p248|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p248_159|p248|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p248_165|p248|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p248_171|p248|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p248_167|p248|We have a budget in March.
p248_173|p248|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p248_198|p248|It was still there, but right at the end.
p248_365|p248|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p248_371|p248|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p248_359|p248|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p248_211|p248|He is slightly confused.
p248_205|p248|It was worth a photograph.
p248_239|p248|It is no surprise.
p248_013|p248|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p248_007|p248|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p248_006|p248|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p248_012|p248|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p248_238|p248|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p248_204|p248|Today was first class.
p248_210|p248|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p248_358|p248|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p248_370|p248|I am a wealthy person.
p248_364|p248|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p248_199|p248|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p248_172|p248|They thought they had found a home.
p248_166|p248|It's that sort of night.
p248_129|p248|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p248_101|p248|That time is not now, however.
p248_115|p248|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p248_303|p248|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p248_317|p248|He was unable to come.
p248_277|p248|He looked very sharp.
p248_263|p248|He will emerge as a world leader.
p248_288|p248|The release attracted little attention.
p248_049|p248|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p248_075|p248|He got the same story.
p248_061|p248|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p248_060|p248|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p248_074|p248|I had my suspicions.
p248_048|p248|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p248_289|p248|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p248_262|p248|That is highly unfair.
p248_276|p248|If not, he should go home.
p248_316|p248|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p248_302|p248|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p248_114|p248|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p248_100|p248|That would be unlawful.
p248_128|p248|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p248_116|p248|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p248_102|p248|Oil embargo endorsed.
p248_328|p248|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
p248_314|p248|The parents will have a great time, too.
p248_300|p248|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p248_248|p248|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p248_260|p248|It is also very valuable.
p248_274|p248|I feel pretty good.
p248_062|p248|Four other charges were dropped.
p248_076|p248|It works for us.
p248_089|p248|They lived for their children.
p248_088|p248|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p248_077|p248|It is a time bomb.
p248_063|p248|It is not great art.
p248_275|p248|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p248_261|p248|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p248_249|p248|It was a cry for help.
p248_301|p248|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p248_315|p248|Donald was his friend.
p248_329|p248|He has to learn.
p248_103|p248|I didn't play well last year.
p248_117|p248|Maybe this battle has been.
p248_113|p248|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p248_107|p248|He pleaded for caution.
p248_311|p248|Other people had looked at it.
p248_305|p248|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p248_339|p248|It's the last thing on my mind.
p248_265|p248|This is a question of Islam.
p248_271|p248|He was also married with two children.
p248_259|p248|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p248_067|p248|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p248_073|p248|Neither it is.
p248_098|p248|Two of the team became ill.
p248_099|p248|That's all right then.
p248_072|p248|Then followed a bout of flu.
p248_066|p248|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p248_258|p248|They must play for each other.
p248_270|p248|He is a young man with a new deal.
p248_264|p248|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p248_338|p248|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p248_304|p248|We have waited a long time for this.
p248_310|p248|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p248_106|p248|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p248_112|p248|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p248_104|p248|That is no use.
p248_110|p248|It had been played at festivals.
p248_138|p248|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p248_306|p248|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p248_312|p248|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p248_272|p248|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p248_266|p248|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p248_299|p248|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p248_070|p248|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p248_064|p248|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p248_058|p248|It's very odd.
p248_059|p248|It will take time.
p248_065|p248|Scotland had great assets.
p248_071|p248|There was an e-mail.
p248_298|p248|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p248_267|p248|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p248_273|p248|It's a way of life.
p248_313|p248|Off with their heads.
p248_307|p248|It should be equal.
p248_139|p248|It was typical.
p248_111|p248|We do not expect any surplus.
p248_105|p248|That all hope is never lost.
p284_202|p284|I am delighted for Simon.
p284_216|p284|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p284_389|p284|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p284_376|p284|It is a simple equation.
p284_410|p284|You know the sort of thing.
p284_404|p284|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p284_362|p284|Yet he left a few days later.
p284_174|p284|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p284_160|p284|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p284_148|p284|The weather forecast isn't good.
p284_149|p284|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p284_161|p284|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p284_175|p284|Everyone can be bought.
p284_405|p284|It will take place in July.
p284_363|p284|The pair are very much in love.
p284_377|p284|Clark is back on top form.
p284_411|p284|I knew the script.
p284_388|p284|It's like a car crash.
p284_217|p284|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p284_203|p284|It had all been arranged.
p284_029|p284|They have no history.
p284_015|p284|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p284_001|p284|Please call Stella.  
p284_017|p284|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p284_003|p284|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p284_215|p284|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p284_201|p284|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p284_229|p284|There is no excuse.
p284_361|p284|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p284_407|p284|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p284_413|p284|Feel the air, the space.
p284_375|p284|They have not done so this season so far.
p284_349|p284|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p284_188|p284|I came home by ambulance.
p284_163|p284|Seven people were later detained by police.
p284_177|p284|I've been there.
p284_176|p284|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p284_162|p284|They are not advertised.
p284_189|p284|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p284_348|p284|A great deal has been achieved.
p284_412|p284|It might be.
p284_374|p284|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p284_360|p284|She is free.
p284_406|p284|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p284_228|p284|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p284_200|p284|There was an e-mail.
p284_214|p284|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p284_002|p284|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p284_016|p284|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p284_012|p284|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p284_006|p284|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p284_238|p284|The scene is about this?
p284_210|p284|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p284_204|p284|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p284_358|p284|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p284_402|p284|But we are a young side.
p284_364|p284|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p284_370|p284|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p284_416|p284|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p284_199|p284|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p284_166|p284|They will do their own thing.
p284_172|p284|It is not either national standards or local control.
p284_173|p284|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p284_167|p284|Does that put pressure on us?
p284_198|p284|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p284_371|p284|They believed it worked.
p284_417|p284|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p284_403|p284|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p284_365|p284|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p284_359|p284|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p284_205|p284|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p284_211|p284|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p284_239|p284|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p284_007|p284|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p284_013|p284|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p284_039|p284|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p284_005|p284|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p284_011|p284|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p284_207|p284|In each case they were a goal down.
p284_213|p284|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p284_398|p284|It can help.
p284_415|p284|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p284_373|p284|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p284_367|p284|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p284_401|p284|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p284_159|p284|These days are long gone.
p284_171|p284|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p284_165|p284|Again, we were lucky.
p284_164|p284|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p284_170|p284|As we worked.
p284_158|p284|Was this element always there?
p284_366|p284|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p284_400|p284|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p284_414|p284|He scored a touchdown.
p284_372|p284|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p284_399|p284|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p284_212|p284|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p284_206|p284|It's not ideal.
p284_010|p284|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p284_004|p284|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p284_038|p284|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p284_088|p284|It is a lifeline.
p284_063|p284|They are real.
p284_077|p284|Even the one she loved.
p284_261|p284|This is a question of Islam.
p284_275|p284|If not, he should go home.
p284_249|p284|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p284_315|p284|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p284_301|p284|Nothing is safe.
p284_329|p284|We are in the end game.
p284_117|p284|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p284_103|p284|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p284_102|p284|They make a selective perception process.
p284_116|p284|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p284_328|p284|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p284_300|p284|What has altered?
p284_314|p284|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p284_248|p284|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p284_274|p284|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p284_260|p284|I am just trying to do my job.
p284_076|p284|The party is up for it.
p284_062|p284|It's that kind of place.
p284_089|p284|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p284_074|p284|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p284_060|p284|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p284_048|p284|Our people are ready.
p284_289|p284|No Briton has ever won.
p284_276|p284|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p284_262|p284|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p284_302|p284|One was a lawyer.
p284_316|p284|Special measures were needed.
p284_100|p284|May not have been at fault?
p284_114|p284|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p284_128|p284|No production was achieved.
p284_129|p284|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p284_115|p284|It is so sad.
p284_101|p284|They tried to deny it.
p284_317|p284|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p284_303|p284|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p284_263|p284|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p284_277|p284|We are a grandmother.
p284_288|p284|We are not going to forget.
p284_049|p284|Here's a clue.
p284_061|p284|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p284_075|p284|Is there a new way forward?
p284_059|p284|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p284_071|p284|He was at home with his pals.
p284_065|p284|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p284_298|p284|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p284_273|p284|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p284_267|p284|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p284_307|p284|Work has started.
p284_313|p284|We want to play at the worlds.
p284_139|p284|I was awful.
p284_105|p284|Oil embargo endorsed.
p284_111|p284|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p284_110|p284|It was a funny game.
p284_104|p284|That's all right then.
p284_138|p284|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p284_312|p284|The letters are going out today.
p284_306|p284|I can live with it.
p284_266|p284|We're in shock.
p284_272|p284|She looked so young.
p284_299|p284|I was the sheep.
p284_064|p284|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p284_070|p284|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p284_058|p284|There's a danger.
p284_099|p284|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p284_066|p284|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p284_072|p284|It was magic.
p284_258|p284|There's not much money in cycling.
p284_264|p284|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p284_270|p284|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p284_338|p284|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p284_310|p284|You should be.
p284_304|p284|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p284_112|p284|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p284_106|p284|Before the game we went for a pint.
p284_107|p284|She reflects a bit.
p284_113|p284|It was the eighties.
p284_305|p284|They are wrong.
p284_311|p284|The minister is the engineer.
p284_339|p284|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p284_271|p284|They seem to get away with it.
p284_265|p284|The system can work.
p284_259|p284|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p284_073|p284|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p284_067|p284|That was a gold medal for certain.
p284_098|p284|It is a love affair.
p284_081|p284|He had taken everything from me.
p284_095|p284|I love the Dome.
p284_042|p284|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p284_056|p284|I expect a rapid response.
p284_283|p284|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p284_297|p284|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p284_240|p284|It was a kind of contempt.
p284_254|p284|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p284_268|p284|It's a way of life.
p284_334|p284|Relief was beyond belief.
p284_320|p284|Such actions are rarely popular.
p284_308|p284|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p284_136|p284|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p284_122|p284|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p284_123|p284|There were no grounds for his action.
p284_137|p284|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p284_309|p284|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p284_321|p284|We have got to get the points from this one.
p284_335|p284|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p284_269|p284|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p284_255|p284|Is that a serious question?
p284_241|p284|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p284_296|p284|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p284_282|p284|He will address the nation this evening.
p284_057|p284|What was the main difference?
p284_043|p284|We will push.
p284_094|p284|It is annoying.
p284_080|p284|Who will pay for this?
p284_096|p284|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p284_082|p284|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p284_055|p284|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p284_041|p284|Dancing was her life.
p284_069|p284|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p284_294|p284|The goals will come.
p284_280|p284|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p284_257|p284|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p284_243|p284|I should think so, too.
p284_323|p284|Henman has been warned.
p284_337|p284|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p284_121|p284|We enjoyed it today.
p284_135|p284|I don't know the full story.
p284_109|p284|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p284_108|p284|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p284_134|p284|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p284_120|p284|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p284_336|p284|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p284_322|p284|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p284_242|p284|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p284_256|p284|They must play for each other.
p284_281|p284|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p284_295|p284|Who can predict?
p284_068|p284|We should have known.
p284_040|p284|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p284_054|p284|Sadly, it can't.
p284_083|p284|By then, he was walking on water.
p284_097|p284|I am extremely sad.
p284_093|p284|Then came the crunch.
p284_087|p284|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p284_078|p284|People must remain vigilant.
p284_050|p284|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p284_044|p284|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p284_291|p284|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p284_285|p284|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p284_252|p284|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p284_246|p284|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p284_326|p284|The problems began a long time ago.
p284_332|p284|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p284_118|p284|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p284_124|p284|I can't even get into the A team.
p284_130|p284|It plans to return to this field.
p284_131|p284|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p284_125|p284|She really suffered for her art.
p284_119|p284|It is rubbish.
p284_333|p284|It is a job creation scheme.
p284_327|p284|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p284_247|p284|Is there on his hands?
p284_253|p284|We have to expand.
p284_284|p284|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p284_290|p284|Painful, but only because it's true.
p284_045|p284|Among them are many criminals.
p284_051|p284|I was inspired by two things.
p284_079|p284|Today she has been released.
p284_086|p284|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p284_092|p284|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p284_084|p284|They lived for their children.
p284_090|p284|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p284_047|p284|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p284_053|p284|My fitness was very poor.
p284_286|p284|This is a national crisis.
p284_292|p284|The songs are just so good.
p284_279|p284|You feel very helpless.
p284_245|p284|There's the mix.
p284_251|p284|Chelsea was a great club.
p284_319|p284|Your father was a good man.
p284_331|p284|There was no time scale.
p284_325|p284|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p284_133|p284|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p284_127|p284|The people will come.
p284_126|p284|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p284_132|p284|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p284_324|p284|I would love it.
p284_330|p284|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p284_318|p284|The show is at an end.
p284_250|p284|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p284_244|p284|It was a hit.
p284_278|p284|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p284_293|p284|And it's a goodbye from him.
p284_287|p284|Bombing slaughter rejected
p284_052|p284|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p284_046|p284|It is marvellous.
p284_091|p284|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p284_085|p284|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p284_021|p284|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p284_035|p284|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p284_009|p284|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p284_223|p284|My wife and family are the support system.
p284_237|p284|You can feel at home in China.
p284_394|p284|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p284_380|p284|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p284_357|p284|I first met him last summer.
p284_425|p284|Nato will prevail.
p284_343|p284|He has to learn.
p284_419|p284|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p284_196|p284|There was no safety net.
p284_182|p284|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p284_155|p284|He was asked to quit.
p284_141|p284|That group reported just before Christmas.
p284_169|p284|Is Saddam a threat?
p284_168|p284|One season, they might do well.
p284_140|p284|The idea is simple.
p284_154|p284|My Dad is a hero.
p284_183|p284|Our team is just so young.
p284_197|p284|It was worth a photograph.
p284_418|p284|It is legally binding.
p284_424|p284|He is to appeal.
p284_342|p284|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p284_356|p284|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p284_381|p284|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p284_395|p284|We try to keep it right.
p284_236|p284|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p284_222|p284|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p284_008|p284|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p284_034|p284|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p284_020|p284|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p284_036|p284|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p284_022|p284|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p284_234|p284|The whole thing will be great.
p284_220|p284|The report is due out next month.
p284_208|p284|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p284_383|p284|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p284_397|p284|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p284_340|p284|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p284_354|p284|I HAVE a dream.
p284_368|p284|There was a substantial explosion.
p284_181|p284|What has caused the demise of singing?
p284_195|p284|It's all about money, money, money.
p284_142|p284|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p284_156|p284|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p284_157|p284|He can do no wrong.
p284_143|p284|It is not just about pay.
p284_194|p284|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p284_180|p284|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p284_369|p284|Their time has gone.
p284_355|p284|We have big ideas.
p284_341|p284|He was the architect.
p284_396|p284|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p284_382|p284|It is hard to understand.
p284_209|p284|I might come back.
p284_221|p284|But she was.
p284_235|p284|Our policy is clear.
p284_023|p284|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p284_037|p284|It's a fact.
p284_033|p284|This is the window.
p284_027|p284|Is this accurate?
p284_219|p284|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p284_231|p284|But it's a subtle process.
p284_225|p284|We were awful.
p284_386|p284|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p284_392|p284|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p284_379|p284|The task is enormous.
p284_423|p284|It was little else.
p284_345|p284|I've got no secret.
p284_351|p284|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p284_184|p284|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p284_190|p284|Is that success?
p284_147|p284|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p284_153|p284|We are on a four-year mission.
p284_152|p284|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p284_146|p284|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p284_191|p284|They are ready.
p284_185|p284|It is a farce.
p284_350|p284|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p284_422|p284|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p284_344|p284|Two people were interviewed.
p284_378|p284|There is no signature.
p284_393|p284|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p284_387|p284|That's the name of the game, though.
p284_224|p284|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p284_230|p284|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p284_218|p284|It's not before time.
p284_026|p284|We will be homeless.
p284_032|p284|There's a story, too.
p284_018|p284|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p284_024|p284|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
p284_030|p284|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p284_226|p284|They tried to give her advice.
p284_232|p284|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p284_391|p284|You had to go and see him.
p284_385|p284|Something is wrong.
p284_408|p284|It is full-scale.
p284_352|p284|They should take their mobile phones.
p284_346|p284|This is a big advantage.
p284_420|p284|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p284_193|p284|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p284_187|p284|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p284_178|p284|Four policemen were wounded.
p284_150|p284|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p284_144|p284|Note the date.
p284_145|p284|So I got a blood test.
p284_151|p284|I was on a roll.
p284_179|p284|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p284_186|p284|Peace was won.
p284_192|p284|I have a cold.
p284_347|p284|I'm very lucky.
p284_421|p284|Eriksson would have approved.
p284_353|p284|Eight months later, he was dead.
p284_409|p284|Then , he laughs.
p284_384|p284|I was lost.
p284_390|p284|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p284_233|p284|The car was just there.
p284_227|p284|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p284_031|p284|I'd just like to play.
p284_025|p284|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p284_019|p284|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p270_029|p270|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p270_203|p270|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p270_217|p270|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p270_388|p270|Last season was very hard for me.
p270_377|p270|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p270_411|p270|That is the ultimate revenge.
p270_405|p270|Ferguson must take the blame.
p270_363|p270|An alternative must be offered.
p270_439|p270|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p270_175|p270|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
p270_161|p270|What form did that take?
p270_149|p270|We will provide immediate access.
p270_148|p270|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p270_160|p270|How independent is that?
p270_174|p270|There is no signature on this document.
p270_438|p270|It would be very dangerous.
p270_404|p270|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p270_362|p270|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p270_376|p270|He must have seen the movie.
p270_410|p270|We must improve our relations with government.
p270_389|p270|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p270_216|p270|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
p270_202|p270|I came home by ambulance.
p270_028|p270|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p270_014|p270|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p270_016|p270|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p270_002|p270|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p270_214|p270|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p270_200|p270|He should emerge as the winner.
p270_228|p270|They are difficult awards to decide.
p270_360|p270|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p270_406|p270|It's too close to call.
p270_412|p270|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p270_374|p270|They knew that I wanted to do something.
p270_348|p270|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p270_189|p270|They bought the property four years ago.
p270_162|p270|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p270_176|p270|They could not match it.
p270_177|p270|His team management was protective.
p270_163|p270|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p270_188|p270|That's not fair to the supporters.
p270_349|p270|Nobody said it was required.
p270_413|p270|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p270_375|p270|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p270_361|p270|We have very limited capacity.
p270_407|p270|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p270_229|p270|I am considered a teenager.
p270_201|p270|In France, the reverse is true.
p270_215|p270|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p270_003|p270|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p270_017|p270|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p270_013|p270|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p270_007|p270|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p270_239|p270|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p270_211|p270|I am very realistic about these things.
p270_205|p270|We believe a third party was involved.
p270_359|p270|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p270_403|p270|There's still no-one like him.
p270_365|p270|Nobody else was with me.
p270_371|p270|You need a licence to run a pub.
p270_417|p270|That was a touch of class.
p270_198|p270|I know every village and island on the west coast.
p270_167|p270|We did what we had to do.
p270_173|p270|Nobody did in those days.
p270_172|p270|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p270_166|p270|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p270_199|p270|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p270_370|p270|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p270_416|p270|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p270_402|p270|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p270_364|p270|The value of the merger is still there.
p270_358|p270|My view has now completely changed.
p270_204|p270|They have the cash and the fire power.
p270_210|p270|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
p270_238|p270|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p270_006|p270|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p270_012|p270|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p270_038|p270|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p270_004|p270|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p270_010|p270|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p270_206|p270|The early physical reports were clear.
p270_212|p270|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p270_399|p270|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p270_428|p270|The woman is basically off her head.
p270_414|p270|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p270_372|p270|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p270_366|p270|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p270_400|p270|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p270_158|p270|Do you think we are a top nation?
p270_170|p270|It's nice to be involved.
p270_164|p270|The woman was his wife.
p270_165|p270|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p270_171|p270|That would open the gates of hell.
p270_159|p270|Is our children learning?
p270_367|p270|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p270_401|p270|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p270_415|p270|Shelter also supports the reform.
p270_373|p270|I came here this week to work.
p270_429|p270|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p270_398|p270|There was a substantial explosion.
p270_213|p270|They are looking at a flotation.
p270_207|p270|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p270_011|p270|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p270_005|p270|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p270_039|p270|This represents a tough game for us.
p270_089|p270|They must be on commission.
p270_062|p270|We have made a commitment to those people.
p270_076|p270|It was a unanimous decision.
p270_260|p270|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p270_274|p270|Or was it?
p270_248|p270|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p270_314|p270|Job losses were also announced.
p270_300|p270|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p270_328|p270|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p270_116|p270|The problem was a social problem.
p270_102|p270|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p270_103|p270|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p270_117|p270|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p270_329|p270|It is a court case.
p270_301|p270|The rescue package is public money.
p270_315|p270|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p270_249|p270|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p270_275|p270|And they were being paid?
p270_261|p270|You're not getting any goodwill.
p270_077|p270|It makes for an interesting conference.
p270_063|p270|Have a look at our accounts.
p270_088|p270|The peace process will be buried!
p270_075|p270|My immune system had been depleted.
p270_061|p270|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p270_049|p270|My fitness was very poor.
p270_288|p270|It was never a free kick.
p270_277|p270|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p270_263|p270|No production contract is yet in sight.
p270_303|p270|The effect was almost magical.
p270_317|p270|The pound has also suffered.
p270_459|p270|We are over the moon.
p270_101|p270|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p270_115|p270|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p270_129|p270|I was on a roll.
p270_128|p270|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p270_114|p270|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p270_100|p270|The following are the principal provisions.
p270_458|p270|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p270_316|p270|It is a road of death.
p270_302|p270|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p270_262|p270|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p270_276|p270|These figures are truly terrible.
p270_289|p270|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p270_048|p270|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p270_060|p270|We have not given up hope.
p270_074|p270|It is not in my nature.
p270_058|p270|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p270_070|p270|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p270_064|p270|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p270_299|p270|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p270_272|p270|I think, therefore I am?
p270_266|p270|We accept the new rules.
p270_448|p270|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p270_306|p270|Selection is not in my hands at all.
p270_460|p270|They're just a good retailer.
p270_312|p270|There was no hint of scandal.
p270_138|p270|They made such decisions in London.
p270_104|p270|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p270_110|p270|You had better believe it.
p270_111|p270|The website has changed the company.
p270_105|p270|I understand the medical concerns.
p270_139|p270|Italy was just behind the US.
p270_313|p270|I was brought up in a mining background.
p270_307|p270|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
p270_461|p270|We are now up against it.
p270_449|p270|The budget was too low for that.
p270_267|p270|It is probably in the culture.
p270_273|p270|Who was she?
p270_298|p270|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p270_065|p270|Final proposals will be published in February.
p270_071|p270|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p270_059|p270|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p270_098|p270|In the end we made too many errors.
p270_067|p270|It wasn't possible to relax.
p270_073|p270|She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
p270_259|p270|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p270_265|p270|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p270_271|p270|What are you not good at?
p270_339|p270|My body is clearly capable.
p270_311|p270|The world record is suspicious.
p270_305|p270|It could well be military.
p270_113|p270|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p270_107|p270|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p270_106|p270|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p270_112|p270|This is a step backwards.
p270_462|p270|Something happened on that island.
p270_304|p270|It would be great to win the title again.
p270_310|p270|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p270_338|p270|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p270_270|p270|how do you get it back?
p270_264|p270|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p270_258|p270|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p270_072|p270|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p270_066|p270|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p270_099|p270|That time is not now, however.
p270_080|p270|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p270_094|p270|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p270_043|p270|Must be prepared to use it.
p270_057|p270|Because we do not need it.
p270_282|p270|Any error is severely punished.
p270_296|p270|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p270_241|p270|The scientific debate is dead.
p270_255|p270|This championship is different from the other majors.
p270_269|p270|I'd never run for them.
p270_453|p270|They were good years for him.
p270_335|p270|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p270_321|p270|Was it the wife?
p270_447|p270|It was to be inclusive.
p270_309|p270|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p270_137|p270|The first half was depressing.
p270_123|p270|Those people must be accountable.
p270_122|p270|That admission is not surprising.
p270_136|p270|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
p270_308|p270|The songs are just so good.
p270_320|p270|Are you going to win?
p270_446|p270|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p270_452|p270|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p270_334|p270|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p270_268|p270|He took over our lives.
p270_254|p270|This is a historic occasion.
p270_240|p270|We were a shambles at the back.
p270_297|p270|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p270_283|p270|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p270_056|p270|After the match, do you?
p270_042|p270|Merger would be entirely logical.
p270_095|p270|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p270_081|p270|They lived for their children.
p270_097|p270|But the battle has only just begun.
p270_083|p270|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p270_054|p270|How do you take them away?
p270_040|p270|The boy is no longer with us.
p270_068|p270|Then followed a bout of flu.
p270_295|p270|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p270_281|p270|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p270_256|p270|Labour was too busy to respond.
p270_242|p270|They are the innocent victims.
p270_444|p270|It shows the right amount of progress.
p270_322|p270|Why change it?
p270_336|p270|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
p270_450|p270|Our legal advice is clear.
p270_120|p270|You can spend money on housing.
p270_134|p270|So what happens next?
p270_108|p270|We deserve a significant rise.
p270_109|p270|I would be prepared to go anywhere.
p270_135|p270|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p270_121|p270|It's not a quick fix.
p270_337|p270|The next week is crucial.
p270_451|p270|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p270_445|p270|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p270_323|p270|What do we want to do that for?
p270_243|p270|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p270_257|p270|I was just getting over the time difference.
p270_280|p270|None of this work is guaranteed.
p270_294|p270|It's hard to see it.
p270_069|p270|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p270_041|p270|Among them are many criminals.
p270_055|p270|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p270_082|p270|Potions said he would drive.
p270_096|p270|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p270_092|p270|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p270_086|p270|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p270_079|p270|I first met him last summer.
p270_051|p270|What do they want us to do?
p270_045|p270|That was the theory, anyway.
p270_290|p270|It involved the same people.
p270_284|p270|I understand the security issue.
p270_253|p270|Everything depends on the weather.
p270_247|p270|It had so much to do with output.
p270_327|p270|There will be good prospects ahead.
p270_441|p270|It is not over by any means.
p270_455|p270|This is the stuff of live music.
p270_333|p270|It is far too early.
p270_119|p270|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p270_125|p270|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p270_131|p270|What are they for?
p270_130|p270|Are they free?
p270_124|p270|I've never seen a game like it.
p270_118|p270|You were made to feel so welcome.
p270_454|p270|Let that be their memorial.
p270_332|p270|He will go a long way.
p270_326|p270|Survival is not an option.
p270_440|p270|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p270_246|p270|And he goes with it.
p270_252|p270|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p270_285|p270|It left me with a sadness.
p270_291|p270|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p270_044|p270|Not if you know the person.
p270_050|p270|He also presented You Bet!
p270_078|p270|I've had it for the exams.
p270_087|p270|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p270_093|p270|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p270_085|p270|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p270_091|p270|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p270_046|p270|I had come back from London.
p270_052|p270|Is it worth it?
p270_287|p270|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p270_293|p270|There's always the next century.
p270_278|p270|He could see no other bidder.
p270_244|p270|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p270_250|p270|The irony was not lost.
p270_318|p270|He has left the company.
p270_330|p270|This isn't the end of story.
p270_456|p270|We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
p270_442|p270|It deserved to be a winner.
p270_324|p270|Does the name matter?
p270_132|p270|Is there a waiting list?
p270_126|p270|But we could only help a handful of people.
p270_127|p270|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p270_133|p270|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p270_443|p270|They are interior designers and architects.
p270_325|p270|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p270_331|p270|It will set the tone.
p270_457|p270|We will deal with the refugees.
p270_319|p270|What happened in that game?
p270_251|p270|I might get an injury very easily.
p270_245|p270|This would include the GM food industry.
p270_279|p270|There's not much money in cycling.
p270_292|p270|You have to expect this type of thing.
p270_286|p270|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p270_053|p270|Does it matter?
p270_047|p270|I had trouble with the producers.
p270_090|p270|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p270_084|p270|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p270_020|p270|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p270_034|p270|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p270_008|p270|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p270_222|p270|Do I think about them often?
p270_236|p270|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p270_395|p270|It sounds like a wish list.
p270_381|p270|So is that it, then?
p270_356|p270|He was at school in Devon.
p270_430|p270|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p270_424|p270|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p270_342|p270|They were impressive against France.
p270_418|p270|People will see this over time.
p270_197|p270|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p270_183|p270|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p270_154|p270|The transaction is not feasible.
p270_140|p270|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p270_168|p270|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p270_169|p270|She returned to the theatre.
p270_141|p270|I feel very grateful with everything.
p270_155|p270|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p270_182|p270|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p270_196|p270|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p270_419|p270|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p270_425|p270|It was a breathtaking moment.
p270_343|p270|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p270_357|p270|This decision is a farce.
p270_431|p270|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p270_380|p270|How are you, sir?
p270_394|p270|It runs until the beginning of June.
p270_237|p270|That was a real challenge.
p270_223|p270|Is it in the right place?
p270_009|p270|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p270_035|p270|Costs have got to be controlled.
p270_021|p270|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p270_037|p270|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p270_023|p270|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p270_235|p270|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p270_221|p270|What was the matter for concern?
p270_209|p270|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p270_382|p270|What do we do?
p270_396|p270|They have not got anyone.
p270_341|p270|There was some merit in that.
p270_427|p270|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
p270_433|p270|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p270_355|p270|It's wonderful to have won.
p270_369|p270|He was then replaced by Ross.
p270_180|p270|City sentiment is in his favour.
p270_194|p270|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p270_143|p270|Before it was an ordeal.
p270_157|p270|My Dad is a hero.
p270_156|p270|We will turn the corner.
p270_142|p270|There was an element of frustration.
p270_195|p270|We represent a wide range of society.
p270_181|p270|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p270_368|p270|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p270_432|p270|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p270_354|p270|There is a good example in this city.
p270_340|p270|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p270_426|p270|It needs to be volatile.
p270_397|p270|It has happened for generations.
p270_383|p270|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p270_208|p270|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p270_220|p270|It had all been arranged.
p270_234|p270|People should make their own decisions.
p270_022|p270|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p270_036|p270|He really is a lovely man.
p270_032|p270|We have to find a way to put that right.
p270_026|p270|They will not be allowed to succeed.
p270_218|p270|From there, they can go anywhere.
p270_230|p270|There's a chance they might come down.
p270_224|p270|Did he trip?
p270_387|p270|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p270_393|p270|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p270_378|p270|She said they would appeal.
p270_422|p270|Such an attack is bizarre.
p270_344|p270|So, did she meet him?
p270_350|p270|This statement has never been withdrawn.
p270_436|p270|I didn't get to keep it.
p270_185|p270|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p270_191|p270|Miller was every bit as happy.
p270_146|p270|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p270_152|p270|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p270_153|p270|They have not been named.
p270_147|p270|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p270_190|p270|They need to look after themselves.
p270_184|p270|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p270_351|p270|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p270_437|p270|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p270_423|p270|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p270_345|p270|So what is the campaign about?
p270_379|p270|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p270_392|p270|I always knew she was funny.
p270_386|p270|She is obviously very disappointed.
p270_225|p270|Does that put pressure on us?
p270_231|p270|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
p270_219|p270|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p270_027|p270|Smoking is also very important.
p270_033|p270|That is the face of fear.
p270_019|p270|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p270_025|p270|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
p270_031|p270|Drugs are a serious problem.
p270_227|p270|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p270_233|p270|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p270_390|p270|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p270_384|p270|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p270_409|p270|Colour was at the core of his life.
p270_435|p270|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p270_353|p270|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p270_347|p270|Are you from the rugby?
p270_421|p270|My aim is a top six finish.
p270_192|p270|You know the sort of thing.
p270_186|p270|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p270_179|p270|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p270_151|p270|It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
p270_145|p270|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p270_144|p270|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p270_150|p270|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p270_178|p270|The jury is still out.
p270_187|p270|They receive a high profile in the media.
p270_193|p270|They were seriously after him.
p270_346|p270|And does it?
p270_420|p270|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p270_434|p270|The British government does not want to know.
p270_352|p270|Whether this return was too soon.
p270_408|p270|Of course, it is nonsense.
p270_385|p270|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p270_391|p270|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p270_232|p270|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p270_226|p270|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p270_030|p270|He has the courage of the unaware.
p270_024|p270|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p270_018|p270|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p246_229|p246|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p246_215|p246|The report is due out next month.
p246_201|p246|I will win.
p246_349|p246|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p246_361|p246|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p246_188|p246|It was very frightened and dirty.
p246_163|p246|We have a budget in March.
p246_177|p246|The goals were good.
p246_176|p246|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p246_162|p246|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p246_189|p246|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p246_360|p246|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p246_348|p246|Until they came to do it.
p246_200|p246|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p246_214|p246|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p246_228|p246|My wife and family are the support system.
p246_002|p246|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p246_016|p246|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p246_028|p246|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p246_014|p246|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p246_202|p246|Feel the heat?
p246_216|p246|Because they didn't want to know.
p246_148|p246|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p246_174|p246|Tony had arrived.
p246_160|p246|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p246_161|p246|It is not like us.
p246_175|p246|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p246_149|p246|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p246_217|p246|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p246_203|p246|He knows a lot.
p246_015|p246|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p246_001|p246|Please call Stella.  
p246_029|p246|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p246_005|p246|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p246_011|p246|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p246_039|p246|Indeed, he does.
p246_207|p246|My neighbours are horrified.
p246_213|p246|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p246_171|p246|It is not either national standards or local control.
p246_165|p246|We should do everything at a stroke.
p246_159|p246|I will tell you.
p246_158|p246|I'd love to be like Peter.
p246_164|p246|Again, we were lucky.
p246_170|p246|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p246_212|p246|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p246_206|p246|I have decided to quit the show.
p246_038|p246|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p246_010|p246|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p246_004|p246|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p246_012|p246|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p246_006|p246|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p246_210|p246|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p246_204|p246|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p246_238|p246|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p246_358|p246|Their time has gone.
p246_199|p246|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p246_166|p246|You had to go and see him.
p246_172|p246|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p246_173|p246|I drove the ball well.
p246_167|p246|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p246_198|p246|It's all about money, money, money.
p246_359|p246|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p246_239|p246|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p246_205|p246|It had all been arranged.
p246_211|p246|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p246_007|p246|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p246_013|p246|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p246_048|p246|There is no reason at all.
p246_074|p246|Today she has been released.
p246_060|p246|Scotland had great assets.
p246_289|p246|Dialogue is the key.
p246_276|p246|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p246_262|p246|Blood samples were taken.
p246_302|p246|She is really magic.
p246_316|p246|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p246_128|p246|It's perfectly feasible.
p246_100|p246|That would be unlawful.
p246_114|p246|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p246_115|p246|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p246_101|p246|Oil embargo endorsed.
p246_129|p246|We work well together.
p246_303|p246|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p246_263|p246|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p246_277|p246|They seem to get away with it.
p246_288|p246|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p246_061|p246|It's that kind of place.
p246_075|p246|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p246_049|p246|The State would provide.
p246_088|p246|Tony Blair said as little.
p246_063|p246|He could make it.
p246_077|p246|He is in the queue.
p246_249|p246|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p246_261|p246|Souter will be back.
p246_275|p246|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p246_329|p246|Who will do it?
p246_315|p246|We are a peaceful people.
p246_301|p246|What has altered?
p246_117|p246|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p246_103|p246|Before the game we went for a pint.
p246_102|p246|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p246_116|p246|Who would have?
p246_300|p246|He was at home with his pals.
p246_314|p246|She is on a life support machine.
p246_328|p246|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p246_274|p246|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p246_260|p246|There's not much money in cycling.
p246_248|p246|There's the mix.
p246_076|p246|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p246_062|p246|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p246_089|p246|As, indeed, they would be.
p246_099|p246|No, the equipment is extra.
p246_066|p246|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p246_072|p246|Even the one she loved.
p246_264|p246|It will be done in stages.
p246_270|p246|We're in shock.
p246_258|p246|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p246_310|p246|The letters are going out today.
p246_304|p246|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p246_338|p246|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p246_112|p246|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p246_106|p246|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p246_107|p246|Is that right?
p246_113|p246|Who would be a referee?
p246_339|p246|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p246_305|p246|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p246_311|p246|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p246_259|p246|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p246_271|p246|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p246_265|p246|There is no link.
p246_073|p246|People must remain vigilant.
p246_067|p246|There could be a way back.
p246_098|p246|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p246_071|p246|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p246_065|p246|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p246_059|p246|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p246_298|p246|And huge, indeed, it is.
p246_273|p246|It's a way of life.
p246_267|p246|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p246_307|p246|The plot is minimal.
p246_313|p246|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p246_105|p246|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p246_111|p246|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p246_139|p246|She died at her home.
p246_138|p246|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p246_110|p246|It is so sad.
p246_104|p246|It was an adventure.
p246_312|p246|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p246_306|p246|We could easily be cut again.
p246_266|p246|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p246_272|p246|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p246_299|p246|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p246_058|p246|I feel I did not have enough time.
p246_064|p246|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p246_070|p246|It is a job creation scheme.
p246_096|p246|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p246_082|p246|It is a blow.
p246_069|p246|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p246_055|p246|It is unique.
p246_041|p246|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p246_294|p246|It was good.
p246_280|p246|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p246_257|p246|I could have got out a long time ago.
p246_243|p246|The scene is about this?
p246_323|p246|There was no time scale.
p246_337|p246|Our policy is clear.
p246_109|p246|It was the eighties.
p246_121|p246|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p246_135|p246|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p246_134|p246|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p246_120|p246|She really suffered for her art.
p246_108|p246|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p246_336|p246|I'm very lucky.
p246_322|p246|Off with their heads.
p246_242|p246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p246_256|p246|They must play for each other.
p246_281|p246|It's so awful.
p246_295|p246|Bombing slaughter rejected
p246_040|p246|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p246_054|p246|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p246_068|p246|Then followed a bout of flu.
p246_083|p246|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p246_097|p246|They make a selective perception process.
p246_081|p246|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p246_095|p246|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p246_042|p246|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p246_056|p246|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p246_283|p246|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p246_297|p246|No Briton has ever won.
p246_268|p246|We are happy.
p246_240|p246|It is hard won.
p246_254|p246|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p246_308|p246|You are the glory.
p246_334|p246|I've got no secret.
p246_320|p246|I came into this world with nothing.
p246_136|p246|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p246_122|p246|It is not a U-turn.
p246_123|p246|I just wanted a break.
p246_137|p246|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p246_321|p246|It's too horrible to think.
p246_335|p246|He loved the moment.
p246_309|p246|The minister is the engineer.
p246_255|p246|Is that a serious question?
p246_241|p246|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p246_296|p246|We are not going to forget.
p246_282|p246|If not, he should go home.
p246_057|p246|That's the truth.
p246_043|p246|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p246_094|p246|I saw the whole thing.
p246_080|p246|A play is a set of actions.
p246_084|p246|They lived for their children.
p246_090|p246|This one did.
p246_047|p246|Is a drug dealer?
p246_053|p246|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p246_286|p246|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p246_292|p246|Yet, it worked.
p246_245|p246|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p246_251|p246|I can't get a job.
p246_279|p246|It is so very obvious.
p246_331|p246|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p246_325|p246|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p246_319|p246|They had a confession.
p246_133|p246|My daughter is an adult.
p246_127|p246|It plans to return to this field.
p246_126|p246|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p246_132|p246|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p246_318|p246|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p246_324|p246|Either team will be hard.
p246_330|p246|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p246_278|p246|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p246_250|p246|Is there on his hands?
p246_244|p246|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p246_293|p246|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p246_287|p246|You feel very helpless.
p246_052|p246|Here's a clue.
p246_046|p246|They said she was stable.
p246_091|p246|It was clear.
p246_085|p246|It will be tight.
p246_093|p246|It is home-grown.
p246_087|p246|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p246_050|p246|She looked so young.
p246_044|p246|We will push.
p246_078|p246|I first met him last summer.
p246_291|p246|It was a virus.
p246_285|p246|But I've won both ways.
p246_252|p246|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p246_246|p246|I should think so, too.
p246_326|p246|He scored a touchdown.
p246_332|p246|This is the last straw.
p246_124|p246|Twaddle is a case in point.
p246_130|p246|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p246_118|p246|There were no grounds for his action.
p246_119|p246|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p246_131|p246|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p246_125|p246|I am now unemployed.
p246_333|p246|Two people were interviewed.
p246_327|p246|Is that an issue?
p246_247|p246|It was a hit.
p246_253|p246|they fail to engage.
p246_284|p246|We are a grandmother.
p246_290|p246|He will address the nation this evening.
p246_079|p246|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p246_045|p246|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p246_051|p246|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p246_086|p246|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p246_092|p246|But I was wrong.
p246_036|p246|It has failed.
p246_022|p246|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p246_208|p246|It's not ideal.
p246_234|p246|You should be.
p246_220|p246|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p246_340|p246|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p246_354|p246|That would help.
p246_181|p246|It's to do with context.
p246_195|p246|Who will pay for this?
p246_142|p246|I was awful.
p246_156|p246|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p246_157|p246|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p246_143|p246|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p246_194|p246|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p246_180|p246|They need to look after themselves.
p246_355|p246|It is a memorial.
p246_341|p246|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p246_221|p246|I'd never seen a play about me.
p246_235|p246|It's quite nice.
p246_209|p246|In each case they were a goal down.
p246_023|p246|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p246_037|p246|They're just different.
p246_009|p246|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p246_021|p246|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p246_035|p246|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p246_223|p246|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p246_237|p246|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p246_357|p246|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p246_343|p246|I got a yellow card.
p246_196|p246|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p246_182|p246|Does this matter?
p246_169|p246|As we worked.
p246_155|p246|We are on a four-year mission.
p246_141|p246|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p246_140|p246|He realises his mistake.
p246_154|p246|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p246_168|p246|He was a crazy man.
p246_183|p246|One was a lawyer.
p246_197|p246|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p246_342|p246|They should take their mobile phones.
p246_236|p246|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p246_222|p246|It's not before time.
p246_034|p246|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p246_020|p246|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p246_008|p246|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p246_024|p246|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p246_030|p246|There's a story, too.
p246_018|p246|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p246_226|p246|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p246_232|p246|Of course I was tempted.
p246_352|p246|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p246_346|p246|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p246_193|p246|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p246_187|p246|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p246_150|p246|I was stunned.
p246_144|p246|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p246_178|p246|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p246_179|p246|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p246_145|p246|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p246_151|p246|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p246_186|p246|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p246_192|p246|I do not own the vessel in question.
p246_347|p246|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p246_353|p246|Hartley should know.
p246_233|p246|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p246_227|p246|At the time, he was a living legend.
p246_019|p246|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p246_031|p246|This is the window.
p246_025|p246|He has not been named.
p246_033|p246|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p246_027|p246|Is this accurate?
p246_231|p246|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p246_225|p246|But she was.
p246_219|p246|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p246_345|p246|He had taken everything from me.
p246_351|p246|I was in the train station overnight.
p246_184|p246|There is no openness.
p246_190|p246|The concerns are the same.
p246_147|p246|I am just trying to do my job.
p246_153|p246|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p246_152|p246|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p246_146|p246|It is not just about pay.
p246_191|p246|Is that success?
p246_185|p246|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p246_350|p246|The pair are very much in love.
p246_344|p246|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p246_218|p246|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p246_224|p246|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p246_230|p246|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p246_026|p246|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p246_032|p246|He was jailed for five years.
p279_406|p279|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p279_348|p279|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p279_189|p279|It just came into my head that day.
p279_176|p279|It is not either national standards or local control.
p279_162|p279|As, indeed, they would be.
p279_002|p279|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p279_016|p279|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p279_200|p279|I have a cold.
p279_214|p279|That is an important part of our role.
p279_228|p279|My neighbours are horrified.
p279_229|p279|At the time, he was a living legend.
p279_215|p279|Twaddle is a case in point.
p279_201|p279|Tommy is not a problem.
p279_017|p279|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p279_003|p279|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p279_163|p279|I have got a wife to feed.
p279_177|p279|The clarity is vital.
p279_188|p279|Does this matter?
p279_349|p279|I kept going for her.
p279_361|p279|Well, the big day has arrived.
p279_375|p279|YOU thought it was a headache.
p279_388|p279|I was in jail for five years.
p279_405|p279|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p279_363|p279|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p279_377|p279|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p279_161|p279|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p279_175|p279|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p279_149|p279|You know the type.
p279_015|p279|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p279_029|p279|Is this accurate?
p279_217|p279|By hard work, is the answer.
p279_203|p279|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p279_202|p279|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p279_216|p279|I am delighted for Simon.
p279_028|p279|They should be so lucky.
p279_014|p279|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p279_148|p279|They did very well.
p279_174|p279|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p279_160|p279|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p279_376|p279|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p279_404|p279|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p279_362|p279|So there, we won.
p279_389|p279|It will take place in July.
p279_399|p279|I have been in good form for the last two years.
p279_366|p279|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p279_400|p279|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p279_372|p279|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p279_158|p279|These days are long gone.
p279_164|p279|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p279_170|p279|Nobody did in those days.
p279_038|p279|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p279_010|p279|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p279_004|p279|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p279_212|p279|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p279_206|p279|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p279_207|p279|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p279_213|p279|The road was closed for several hours.
p279_005|p279|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p279_011|p279|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p279_039|p279|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p279_171|p279|My life has been destroyed.
p279_165|p279|Tell it like it was?
p279_159|p279|It is an attitude of mind.
p279_373|p279|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p279_367|p279|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p279_401|p279|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p279_398|p279|You make the choice.
p279_359|p279|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p279_371|p279|He denied the charge.
p279_403|p279|The weekly average was three hours.
p279_365|p279|There is no signature.
p279_198|p279|Our strategy is straightforward.
p279_173|p279|Is Saddam a threat?
p279_167|p279|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p279_007|p279|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p279_013|p279|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p279_239|p279|You take a risk.
p279_205|p279|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p279_211|p279|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p279_210|p279|I don't want to use it.
p279_204|p279|He had suffered a heart attack.
p279_238|p279|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p279_012|p279|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p279_006|p279|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p279_166|p279|It is not too late to get on board.
p279_172|p279|His team management was protective.
p279_199|p279|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p279_402|p279|What would be the point?
p279_364|p279|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p279_370|p279|Again, we were lucky.
p279_358|p279|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p279_317|p279|My body is clearly capable.
p279_303|p279|They are wrong.
p279_115|p279|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p279_101|p279|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p279_129|p279|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p279_061|p279|Here's a clue.
p279_075|p279|It is like a river running by my home.
p279_049|p279|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p279_288|p279|It's like a high school play.
p279_263|p279|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p279_277|p279|She looked so young.
p279_276|p279|They seem to get away with it.
p279_262|p279|The warning is timely.
p279_289|p279|It was hopeless.
p279_048|p279|It is urgent.
p279_074|p279|Have a look at our accounts.
p279_060|p279|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p279_128|p279|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p279_100|p279|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p279_114|p279|This is a step backwards.
p279_302|p279|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p279_316|p279|Craig is a major concern for us.
p279_300|p279|I thought it was my only chance.
p279_314|p279|It is all credit to them today.
p279_328|p279|Was this element always there?
p279_102|p279|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p279_116|p279|This film will be totally awesome.
p279_089|p279|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p279_076|p279|The end result is precisely the same.
p279_062|p279|He had no enemies.
p279_274|p279|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p279_260|p279|People should not become complacent.
p279_248|p279|He's a lovely young man.
p279_249|p279|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p279_261|p279|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p279_275|p279|The script was funny.
p279_063|p279|Sadly, it can't.
p279_077|p279|It seemed so personal.
p279_088|p279|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p279_117|p279|My office is bare.
p279_103|p279|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p279_329|p279|They haven't got a hope.
p279_315|p279|They were fantastic.
p279_301|p279|One was a lawyer.
p279_339|p279|The boat was fantastic.
p279_305|p279|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p279_311|p279|I did not name it.
p279_107|p279|Before the game we went for a pint.
p279_113|p279|I was angry.
p279_098|p279|The peace process will be buried!
p279_073|p279|He was popular.
p279_067|p279|They were too hard.
p279_259|p279|they fail to engage.
p279_271|p279|It is the same in Sweden.
p279_265|p279|It looks as though he will be right.
p279_264|p279|Blood samples were taken.
p279_270|p279|It was an easy decision to come here.
p279_258|p279|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p279_066|p279|That's the truth.
p279_072|p279|Scotland had great assets.
p279_099|p279|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p279_112|p279|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p279_106|p279|I didn't play well last year.
p279_310|p279|The letters are going out today.
p279_304|p279|This is a war over our home.
p279_338|p279|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p279_312|p279|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p279_306|p279|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p279_138|p279|It's perfectly feasible.
p279_110|p279|I don't have many friends.
p279_104|p279|I see no need for change.
p279_058|p279|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p279_064|p279|We have not given up hope.
p279_070|p279|They're appalled by that.
p279_299|p279|Graeme was prepared.
p279_266|p279|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p279_272|p279|That could be in place by next year.
p279_273|p279|Things can change.
p279_267|p279|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p279_298|p279|What has altered?
p279_071|p279|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p279_065|p279|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p279_059|p279|Life is good.
p279_105|p279|That would be unlawful.
p279_111|p279|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p279_139|p279|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p279_307|p279|It was entirely justified.
p279_313|p279|Special measures were needed.
p279_336|p279|The composer will conduct.
p279_322|p279|He got the same story.
p279_134|p279|It will be too hot.
p279_120|p279|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p279_108|p279|They will want to perform well.
p279_083|p279|She died in hospital two hours later.
p279_097|p279|Until you hit the big games.
p279_040|p279|President Bush is at war.
p279_054|p279|But it might have done.
p279_068|p279|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p279_281|p279|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p279_295|p279|He should have won.
p279_242|p279|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p279_256|p279|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p279_257|p279|This is a big club.
p279_243|p279|He will go a long way.
p279_294|p279|These figures are truly awful.
p279_280|p279|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
p279_069|p279|Art is extra.
p279_055|p279|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p279_041|p279|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p279_096|p279|It is an old family habit.
p279_082|p279|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p279_109|p279|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p279_121|p279|Who would have?
p279_135|p279|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p279_323|p279|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p279_337|p279|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p279_321|p279|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p279_335|p279|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p279_309|p279|It's certainly different.
p279_123|p279|We work on the same level.
p279_137|p279|You've got to be vigilant.
p279_094|p279|Yet, it worked.
p279_080|p279|I've been there.
p279_057|p279|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p279_043|p279|Dancing was her life.
p279_296|p279|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p279_282|p279|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p279_255|p279|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p279_241|p279|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p279_269|p279|It left me with a sadness.
p279_268|p279|It's very nice.
p279_240|p279|It's too much work.
p279_254|p279|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p279_283|p279|You've got to have both sides.
p279_297|p279|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p279_042|p279|I was scared.
p279_056|p279|As she explains.
p279_081|p279|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p279_095|p279|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p279_136|p279|I am now unemployed.
p279_122|p279|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p279_308|p279|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p279_334|p279|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p279_320|p279|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p279_318|p279|I came into this world with nothing.
p279_324|p279|He was then replaced by Ross.
p279_330|p279|He did a good job.
p279_126|p279|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p279_132|p279|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p279_091|p279|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p279_085|p279|It works for us.
p279_052|p279|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p279_046|p279|We will push.
p279_293|p279|It changed my life.
p279_287|p279|Who will perform?
p279_278|p279|It happens from time to time.
p279_250|p279|This year I understood.
p279_244|p279|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p279_245|p279|The scene is about this?
p279_251|p279|This is the culture change in medicine.
p279_279|p279|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p279_286|p279|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p279_292|p279|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p279_047|p279|That period was a struggle.
p279_053|p279|It's a blessing.
p279_084|p279|Is there a new way forward?
p279_090|p279|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p279_133|p279|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p279_127|p279|I'm so angry.
p279_331|p279|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p279_325|p279|She did not attend the courtroom.
p279_319|p279|The airport was even different.
p279_333|p279|It will be very, very tight.
p279_327|p279|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p279_119|p279|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p279_131|p279|Well, you can have a tree.
p279_125|p279|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p279_086|p279|It is a time bomb.
p279_092|p279|They lived for their children.
p279_079|p279|He had been a singer.
p279_045|p279|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p279_051|p279|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p279_284|p279|The attacker died in the crash.
p279_290|p279|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p279_247|p279|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p279_253|p279|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p279_252|p279|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p279_246|p279|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p279_291|p279|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p279_285|p279|It was a virus.
p279_050|p279|The judge said.
p279_044|p279|It will come all right.
p279_078|p279|Painful, but only because it's true.
p279_093|p279|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p279_087|p279|This is the way things should be handled.
p279_124|p279|You can spend money on housing.
p279_130|p279|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p279_118|p279|Does this mean.
p279_326|p279|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p279_332|p279|It is so unfair.
p279_396|p279|You ask the question.
p279_382|p279|It's like a basketball.
p279_355|p279|He could make it.
p279_341|p279|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p279_369|p279|He has the edge.
p279_194|p279|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p279_180|p279|That has been the easy part.
p279_157|p279|I am very happy with life.
p279_143|p279|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p279_023|p279|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p279_037|p279|They're just different.
p279_221|p279|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p279_235|p279|It is set in Paris.
p279_209|p279|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p279_208|p279|There was no rescue.
p279_234|p279|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p279_220|p279|His death was a tragic accident.
p279_036|p279|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p279_022|p279|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p279_142|p279|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p279_156|p279|This latter point is hugely important.
p279_181|p279|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p279_195|p279|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p279_368|p279|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p279_340|p279|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p279_354|p279|It's that sort of night.
p279_383|p279|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p279_397|p279|Not because they want to sing about something.
p279_381|p279|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p279_395|p279|So I did.
p279_342|p279|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p279_356|p279|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p279_183|p279|Government will intervene.
p279_197|p279|It was typical.
p279_140|p279|This represents a tough game for us.
p279_154|p279|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p279_168|p279|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p279_034|p279|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p279_020|p279|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p279_008|p279|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p279_236|p279|They should come forward.
p279_222|p279|He's a nice guy.
p279_223|p279|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p279_237|p279|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p279_009|p279|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p279_021|p279|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p279_035|p279|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p279_169|p279|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p279_155|p279|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p279_141|p279|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p279_196|p279|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p279_182|p279|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p279_357|p279|I lost my head.
p279_343|p279|You need a licence to run a pub.
p279_394|p279|He's already made history.
p279_380|p279|We try to keep it right.
p279_384|p279|I can lead by example.
p279_390|p279|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p279_347|p279|It is horrible.
p279_353|p279|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p279_186|p279|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p279_192|p279|It is tough, but possible.
p279_179|p279|I drove the ball well.
p279_145|p279|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p279_151|p279|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p279_019|p279|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p279_031|p279|There's a story, too.
p279_025|p279|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p279_233|p279|Broke the birdie record.
p279_227|p279|It is a gamble.
p279_226|p279|I'd never seen a play about me.
p279_232|p279|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p279_024|p279|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p279_030|p279|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p279_018|p279|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p279_150|p279|In each case they were a goal down.
p279_144|p279|Is that Titanic?
p279_178|p279|The hotel was now for sale.
p279_193|p279|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p279_187|p279|It's a joke.
p279_352|p279|We are looking for perfection.
p279_346|p279|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p279_391|p279|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p279_385|p279|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p279_393|p279|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p279_387|p279|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p279_378|p279|It doesn't always work that way.
p279_350|p279|He has seen the past.
p279_344|p279|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p279_191|p279|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p279_185|p279|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p279_152|p279|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p279_146|p279|It is like a football team.
p279_026|p279|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p279_032|p279|People love to see this stuff.
p279_218|p279|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p279_224|p279|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p279_230|p279|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p279_231|p279|They are the innocent victims.
p279_225|p279|I am immensely sad.
p279_219|p279|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p279_033|p279|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p279_027|p279|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p279_147|p279|I am just trying to do my job.
p279_153|p279|It was the same at Twickenham.
p279_184|p279|We knew nothing about it.
p279_190|p279|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p279_345|p279|The salary changes are long overdue.
p279_351|p279|Hartley should know.
p279_379|p279|I'm pleased about one thing.
p279_386|p279|He is on the wrong side.
p279_392|p279|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p241_241|p241|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p241_296|p241|It just came into my head that day.
p241_282|p241|Yet, it worked.
p241_057|p241|What was the main difference?
p241_043|p241|That period was a struggle.
p241_094|p241|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p241_080|p241|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p241_123|p241|I'm so angry.
p241_137|p241|It was typical.
p241_309|p241|Is there on his hands?
p241_321|p241|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p241_334|p241|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p241_320|p241|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p241_308|p241|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p241_136|p241|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p241_122|p241|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p241_081|p241|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p241_095|p241|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p241_042|p241|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p241_056|p241|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p241_283|p241|I should think so, too.
p241_297|p241|Our task is to complete the picture.
p241_240|p241|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p241_254|p241|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p241_268|p241|And Michael was just great.
p241_242|p241|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p241_256|p241|They are real.
p241_281|p241|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p241_295|p241|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p241_068|p241|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p241_040|p241|President Bush is at war.
p241_083|p241|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p241_108|p241|Is that right?
p241_134|p241|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p241_120|p241|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p241_336|p241|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p241_322|p241|It is a strong case.
p241_323|p241|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p241_337|p241|I must make that clear.
p241_121|p241|You can spend money on housing.
p241_135|p241|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p241_109|p241|You had better believe it.
p241_096|p241|The peace process will be buried!
p241_082|p241|I first met him last summer.
p241_055|p241|Next league matches Celtic.
p241_041|p241|It was ugly.
p241_069|p241|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p241_294|p241|What has altered?
p241_280|p241|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p241_257|p241|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p241_243|p241|The scene is about this?
p241_247|p241|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p241_253|p241|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p241_284|p241|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p241_290|p241|A new school will be built.
p241_045|p241|We need to chat.
p241_051|p241|He looks like an Afghan.
p241_079|p241|This is the way things should be handled.
p241_092|p241|Today I couldn't run on it.
p241_125|p241|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p241_119|p241|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p241_333|p241|Who will do it?
p241_327|p241|I'd like to take the plunge.
p241_326|p241|We agreed to disagree.
p241_332|p241|They should stop the bombing.
p241_118|p241|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p241_124|p241|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p241_130|p241|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p241_093|p241|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p241_087|p241|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p241_078|p241|I've got the shirt.
p241_050|p241|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p241_044|p241|This represents a tough game for us.
p241_291|p241|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p241_285|p241|The death toll included five children.
p241_252|p241|Special measures were needed.
p241_246|p241|They are different types.
p241_250|p241|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p241_244|p241|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p241_278|p241|We have to break that cycle.
p241_293|p241|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p241_287|p241|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p241_052|p241|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p241_046|p241|That time has passed.
p241_091|p241|Now the system is right behind us.
p241_085|p241|Someone who cares
p241_126|p241|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p241_132|p241|What will happen then?
p241_324|p241|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p241_330|p241|Who was the mystery MP?
p241_319|p241|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p241_331|p241|It's been hard.
p241_325|p241|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p241_133|p241|It's not true.
p241_127|p241|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p241_084|p241|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p241_090|p241|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p241_047|p241|As she explains.
p241_053|p241|However the drama was still not at an end.
p241_286|p241|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p241_292|p241|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p241_279|p241|I saw it at a ruck.
p241_245|p241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p241_251|p241|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p241_236|p241|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p241_222|p241|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p241_008|p241|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p241_034|p241|And we have a singer.
p241_168|p241|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p241_140|p241|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p241_154|p241|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p241_183|p241|Four policemen were wounded.
p241_197|p241|Is that success?
p241_342|p241|I would miss him.
p241_356|p241|It benefits the whole family.
p241_357|p241|Our numbers are small.
p241_343|p241|Tiger is the exception.
p241_196|p241|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p241_182|p241|They will run a mile.
p241_155|p241|Was this element always there?
p241_141|p241|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p241_169|p241|It is too much for me.
p241_021|p241|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p241_035|p241|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p241_009|p241|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p241_223|p241|We played them off the pitch.
p241_237|p241|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p241_209|p241|But I am a worried man.
p241_221|p241|You have to do your research.
p241_235|p241|We were extremely poor.
p241_023|p241|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p241_037|p241|It's nice to hear.
p241_157|p241|It was so new, so exciting.
p241_143|p241|Is that Titanic?
p241_180|p241|They know no other way.
p241_369|p241|There was no hint of scandal.
p241_340|p241|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p241_354|p241|As, indeed, they would be.
p241_368|p241|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p241_181|p241|It is minute.
p241_195|p241|It's the same old story.
p241_142|p241|He is severe.
p241_036|p241|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p241_234|p241|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p241_220|p241|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p241_208|p241|I don't want to use it.
p241_224|p241|But it will be sorted out this week.
p241_230|p241|It is not the message alone.
p241_218|p241|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p241_026|p241|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p241_032|p241|This is the window.
p241_152|p241|They were later discharged from hospital.
p241_146|p241|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p241_191|p241|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p241_185|p241|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p241_350|p241|There is a cup final at stake.
p241_344|p241|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p241_345|p241|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p241_351|p241|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p241_184|p241|We did everything by the book.
p241_190|p241|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p241_147|p241|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p241_153|p241|Neither side can win this war.
p241_033|p241|People love to see this stuff.
p241_027|p241|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p241_219|p241|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p241_231|p241|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p241_225|p241|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p241_233|p241|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p241_227|p241|The track is currently covered in snow.
p241_031|p241|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p241_025|p241|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p241_019|p241|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p241_145|p241|I am just trying to do my job.
p241_151|p241|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p241_179|p241|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p241_186|p241|What has caused the demise of singing?
p241_192|p241|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p241_347|p241|I got a yellow card.
p241_353|p241|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p241_352|p241|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p241_346|p241|His contract was then not renewed.
p241_193|p241|Off I went.
p241_187|p241|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p241_178|p241|I drove the ball well.
p241_150|p241|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p241_144|p241|That group reported just before Christmas.
p241_018|p241|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p241_024|p241|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p241_030|p241|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p241_226|p241|My neighbours are horrified.
p241_232|p241|Hospitals are for the ill.
p241_217|p241|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p241_203|p241|He's not perfect.
p241_029|p241|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p241_001|p241|Please call Stella.  
p241_149|p241|We want to see the maximum of change.
p241_161|p241|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p241_175|p241|And I saw the light!
p241_363|p241|Equity declined to comment.
p241_362|p241|This is a club on the rise.
p241_174|p241|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p241_160|p241|We do not get that impression now.
p241_148|p241|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p241_014|p241|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p241_028|p241|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p241_202|p241|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p241_216|p241|I was so nervous.
p241_228|p241|Who would be right?
p241_200|p241|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p241_214|p241|It's been a good year.
p241_002|p241|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p241_016|p241|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p241_176|p241|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p241_162|p241|We have to move forward.
p241_189|p241|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p241_374|p241|There is no signature.
p241_360|p241|We are looking for perfection.
p241_349|p241|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p241_188|p241|I wish I could say something.
p241_163|p241|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p241_177|p241|The clarity is vital.
p241_017|p241|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p241_003|p241|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p241_215|p241|We want to keep the pound.
p241_229|p241|It is set in Paris.
p241_205|p241|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p241_211|p241|It had all been arranged.
p241_239|p241|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p241_007|p241|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p241_013|p241|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p241_173|p241|One season, they might do well.
p241_167|p241|The post will be unpaid.
p241_198|p241|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p241_371|p241|Well, the big day has arrived.
p241_365|p241|The play is based on a real-life event.
p241_359|p241|So I left.
p241_358|p241|That would help.
p241_364|p241|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p241_370|p241|Safety was also an issue.
p241_199|p241|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p241_166|p241|They will do their own thing.
p241_172|p241|It became a book by itself.
p241_012|p241|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p241_006|p241|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p241_238|p241|It is hard won.
p241_210|p241|He knows a lot.
p241_204|p241|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p241_212|p241|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p241_206|p241|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p241_010|p241|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p241_004|p241|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p241_038|p241|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p241_164|p241|We have a budget in March.
p241_170|p241|He was a crazy man.
p241_158|p241|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p241_366|p241|He could face a jail sentence.
p241_372|p241|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p241_373|p241|Talks are progressing.
p241_159|p241|I've put my own money into this project.
p241_171|p241|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p241_165|p241|There was no respite.
p241_039|p241|It is not for any other purpose.
p241_005|p241|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p241_011|p241|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p241_207|p241|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p241_213|p241|His third goal was superb.
p241_248|p241|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p241_274|p241|It was a privilege to work for him.
p241_260|p241|It was good fun.
p241_076|p241|He is now resident in England.
p241_062|p241|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p241_089|p241|They have not done so this season so far.
p241_102|p241|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p241_116|p241|I'm delighted about that.
p241_328|p241|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p241_300|p241|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p241_314|p241|Craig is a major concern for us.
p241_315|p241|The home team had an amazing start.
p241_301|p241|This is a war over our home.
p241_329|p241|I've not thought about it.
p241_117|p241|I joined a group.
p241_103|p241|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p241_088|p241|And rugby fans can help.
p241_063|p241|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p241_077|p241|Even the one she loved.
p241_261|p241|It looks as though he will be right.
p241_275|p241|It's so awful.
p241_249|p241|This is the culture change in medicine.
p241_277|p241|We are a grandmother.
p241_288|p241|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p241_049|p241|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p241_061|p241|It was all in a short period of time.
p241_075|p241|It is a job creation scheme.
p241_129|p241|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p241_115|p241|He will emerge as a world leader.
p241_101|p241|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p241_317|p241|It is out there.
p241_303|p241|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p241_302|p241|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p241_100|p241|It was mayhem.
p241_114|p241|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p241_128|p241|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p241_074|p241|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p241_048|p241|He is too weak to move.
p241_289|p241|It changed my life.
p241_276|p241|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p241_262|p241|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p241_266|p241|It left me with a sadness.
p241_272|p241|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p241_299|p241|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p241_064|p241|The script was funny.
p241_070|p241|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p241_058|p241|I was an athlete.
p241_110|p241|We want to help them through it.
p241_104|p241|They will want to perform well.
p241_138|p241|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p241_312|p241|Kids are terrible.
p241_306|p241|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p241_307|p241|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p241_313|p241|It should be equal.
p241_139|p241|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p241_105|p241|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p241_111|p241|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p241_059|p241|There was a battle there.
p241_071|p241|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p241_065|p241|He could make it.
p241_298|p241|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p241_273|p241|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p241_267|p241|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p241_271|p241|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p241_265|p241|It's very nice.
p241_259|p241|That's the only thing I will say.
p241_073|p241|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p241_067|p241|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p241_098|p241|I love the Dome.
p241_107|p241|It was his job to check.
p241_113|p241|It's not fair.
p241_305|p241|And he goes with it.
p241_311|p241|I was rubbish.
p241_338|p241|The train was on time.
p241_310|p241|It was a question of patience.
p241_304|p241|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p241_112|p241|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p241_106|p241|I'm not depressed.
p241_099|p241|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p241_066|p241|Try to save us.
p241_072|p241|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p241_258|p241|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p241_264|p241|Immediate action must be taken.
p241_270|p241|Access has been a nightmare.
p225_166|p225|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
p225_199|p225|And they were being paid?
p225_006|p225|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p225_012|p225|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p225_210|p225|Scotland will play its part.
p225_238|p225|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p225_239|p225|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p225_211|p225|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p225_013|p225|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p225_007|p225|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p225_173|p225|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
p225_359|p225|But we welcome this document.
p225_365|p225|You did not see it.
p225_165|p225|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p225_171|p225|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
p225_159|p225|Neither side can win this war.
p225_011|p225|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p225_005|p225|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p225_039|p225|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p225_212|p225|After that nothing could save him.
p225_038|p225|Diving is no part of football.
p225_004|p225|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p225_010|p225|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p225_158|p225|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p225_366|p225|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p225_174|p225|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
p225_028|p225|Do I have a favourite?
p225_014|p225|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p225_202|p225|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
p225_203|p225|They have the cash and the fire power.
p225_001|p225|Please call Stella.
p225_029|p225|What do we do?
p225_175|p225|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p225_149|p225|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p225_363|p225|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p225_349|p225|How do you take them away?
p225_177|p225|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p225_003|p225|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p225_017|p225|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p225_201|p225|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p225_200|p225|It looked like a river.
p225_016|p225|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p225_002|p225|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p225_176|p225|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p225_348|p225|Does it matter?
p225_111|p225|It isn't a happy memory.
p225_065|p225|There is no pressure on us.
p225_071|p225|He is in the queue.
p225_059|p225|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p225_273|p225|He has not created a Festival resource.
p225_298|p225|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p225_299|p225|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p225_266|p225|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p225_058|p225|However, the problem is the timing.
p225_070|p225|That is bound to happen.
p225_064|p225|It could take some time.
p225_104|p225|His is a success story by any standard.
p225_110|p225|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p225_312|p225|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p225_310|p225|What are they for?
p225_072|p225|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p225_066|p225|It is a job creation scheme.
p225_264|p225|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p225_258|p225|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p225_265|p225|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p225_067|p225|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p225_073|p225|So, did she meet him?
p225_113|p225|The big issue for us is the review.
p225_305|p225|Cast Away now on general release.
p225_329|p225|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p225_301|p225|I must do something about it.
p225_315|p225|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p225_103|p225|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
p225_117|p225|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
p225_063|p225|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p225_275|p225|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p225_274|p225|We have not reached the point of no return.
p225_248|p225|Does that put pressure on us?
p225_089|p225|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p225_062|p225|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p225_116|p225|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p225_314|p225|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p225_300|p225|I can hardly believe it.
p225_328|p225|It is just a tax on employment.
p225_316|p225|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
p225_302|p225|Three hours later, the man was free.
p225_128|p225|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p225_114|p225|I told him I was a long time ago.
p225_060|p225|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p225_276|p225|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p225_289|p225|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p225_277|p225|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p225_061|p225|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p225_049|p225|I have learned from him.
p225_115|p225|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p225_303|p225|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p225_317|p225|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p225_332|p225|It's difficult to predict the future.
p225_326|p225|He will go a long way.
p225_124|p225|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p225_118|p225|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p225_044|p225|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p225_285|p225|We have to break that cycle.
p225_291|p225|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p225_290|p225|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p225_253|p225|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p225_092|p225|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p225_086|p225|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p225_051|p225|We are committed to the ban.
p225_045|p225|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p225_131|p225|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p225_325|p225|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p225_331|p225|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p225_319|p225|There's still a bit to go.
p225_127|p225|It is a common problem.
p225_133|p225|I think he's the favourite.
p225_053|p225|I have made that offer.
p225_090|p225|I did not have a bet on myself.
p225_084|p225|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
p225_279|p225|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p225_286|p225|I wanted to change the formula.
p225_287|p225|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
p225_293|p225|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p225_244|p225|What was the matter for concern?
p225_046|p225|No details of the talks were given.
p225_052|p225|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p225_126|p225|The squad is too small.
p225_318|p225|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
p225_330|p225|We are a peaceful people.
p225_324|p225|There is no plan B.
p225_308|p225|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p225_320|p225|We have a good healthy debate.
p225_334|p225|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p225_122|p225|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p225_136|p225|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p225_056|p225|Clearly, it can go either way.
p225_081|p225|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p225_268|p225|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p225_254|p225|The problem was a social problem.
p225_240|p225|We are in the hat.
p225_297|p225|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
p225_282|p225|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
p225_296|p225|It goes back a long way.
p225_241|p225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p225_094|p225|That's as it should be.
p225_057|p225|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p225_123|p225|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p225_335|p225|We are in the end game.
p225_309|p225|Are they free?
p225_337|p225|But they have the sound.
p225_323|p225|It is a court case.
p225_109|p225|That might help a bit.
p225_135|p225|We have seen a copy of the report.
p225_121|p225|You get a lot for your money.
p225_082|p225|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p225_243|p225|The irony was not lost.
p225_257|p225|My son was too young to die.
p225_280|p225|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p225_294|p225|However, we had no failures in our side.
p225_295|p225|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p225_281|p225|They were not at the property yesterday.
p225_242|p225|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p225_083|p225|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p225_054|p225|Four other charges were dropped.
p225_040|p225|You'd better believe it.
p225_120|p225|The industry is not well organised.
p225_108|p225|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p225_322|p225|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p225_336|p225|I came into this world with nothing.
p225_351|p225|After the match, do you?
p225_153|p225|We have a clean bill of health.
p225_147|p225|Does the name matter?
p225_027|p225|So is that it, then?
p225_033|p225|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p225_225|p225|It is good for our team.
p225_219|p225|They did not attack the themes of the book.
p225_218|p225|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p225_224|p225|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p225_026|p225|How are you, sir?
p225_191|p225|People will ask about us.
p225_152|p225|The weather forecast isn't good.
p225_350|p225|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p225_346|p225|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p225_352|p225|He was then replaced by Ross.
p225_144|p225|She will do for me.
p225_150|p225|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p225_193|p225|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p225_030|p225|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p225_024|p225|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p225_018|p225|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p225_019|p225|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p225_025|p225|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p225_192|p225|However, this idea is never developed.
p225_179|p225|They know no other way.
p225_151|p225|Nothing has been put into action.
p225_145|p225|Why change it?
p225_353|p225|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p225_347|p225|Boy is the town a mess.
p225_357|p225|It is a sign of hope.
p225_169|p225|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p225_141|p225|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p225_182|p225|We are just glad to be alive.
p225_196|p225|I think, therefore I am?
p225_009|p225|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p225_035|p225|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225_021|p225|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p225_237|p225|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p225_223|p225|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p225_222|p225|In each case they were a goal down.
p225_236|p225|That will be the criteria for the future.
p225_020|p225|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p225_008|p225|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p225_197|p225|Who was she?
p225_356|p225|I said he was set to retire.
p225_354|p225|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p225_156|p225|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p225_142|p225|Well, you can have a tree.
p225_195|p225|It is hard to tell.
p225_022|p225|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p225_036|p225|It was a close call.
p225_208|p225|You are a great player.
p225_220|p225|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p225_235|p225|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p225_221|p225|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p225_037|p225|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p225_023|p225|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p225_143|p225|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p225_157|p225|He was asked to quit.
p225_355|p225|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p240_085|p240|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p240_091|p240|Today I couldn't run on it.
p240_278|p240|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
p240_244|p240|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p240_250|p240|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p240_293|p240|It was a virus.
p240_318|p240|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p240_330|p240|That's the law of the land.
p240_324|p240|Craig is a major concern for us.
p240_132|p240|It was the same at Twickenham.
p240_126|p240|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p240_127|p240|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p240_133|p240|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p240_325|p240|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p240_331|p240|Donald was his friend.
p240_319|p240|They were fantastic.
p240_292|p240|He will address the nation this evening.
p240_286|p240|If not, he should go home.
p240_251|p240|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p240_245|p240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p240_279|p240|It's a way of life.
p240_090|p240|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p240_084|p240|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p240_053|p240|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p240_047|p240|It is so sad.
p240_079|p240|Today she has been released.
p240_051|p240|It's a blessing.
p240_045|p240|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p240_092|p240|She told The Herald.
p240_086|p240|Someone who cares
p240_253|p240|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p240_247|p240|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p240_290|p240|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p240_284|p240|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p240_327|p240|Referees are easy targets.
p240_333|p240|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p240_119|p240|She really suffered for her art.
p240_125|p240|I was furious.
p240_131|p240|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p240_130|p240|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p240_124|p240|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p240_118|p240|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p240_332|p240|I am so upset.
p240_326|p240|It is out there.
p240_285|p240|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p240_291|p240|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p240_246|p240|It is hard won.
p240_252|p240|He got the same story.
p240_087|p240|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p240_093|p240|We could not get any possession.
p240_044|p240|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p240_050|p240|Who can say?
p240_078|p240|I've got the shirt.
p240_054|p240|He is too weak to move.
p240_040|p240|It's a real threat.
p240_068|p240|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p240_097|p240|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
p240_083|p240|He is in the queue.
p240_256|p240|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p240_242|p240|He was good, but not that good.
p240_295|p240|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p240_281|p240|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p240_322|p240|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p240_336|p240|We agreed to disagree.
p240_120|p240|It is a delight on every level.
p240_134|p240|It is also well received.
p240_108|p240|It's a shame.
p240_109|p240|It had been played at festivals.
p240_135|p240|Government will intervene.
p240_121|p240|You can spend money on housing.
p240_337|p240|It could have gone either way.
p240_323|p240|Henman has been warned.
p240_280|p240|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p240_294|p240|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p240_243|p240|We were extremely poor.
p240_257|p240|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p240_082|p240|What has changed?
p240_096|p240|They were outside the circle.
p240_069|p240|It should be devolved.
p240_041|p240|It was the eighties.
p240_055|p240|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p240_043|p240|President Bush is at war.
p240_057|p240|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p240_080|p240|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p240_094|p240|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p240_241|p240|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p240_255|p240|A friendship that will endure.
p240_269|p240|This is a question of Islam.
p240_282|p240|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p240_296|p240|It's like a high school play.
p240_335|p240|The police have to act to help them.
p240_321|p240|We are a peaceful people.
p240_309|p240|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p240_137|p240|He was in a great deal of pain.
p240_123|p240|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p240_122|p240|There were no grounds for his action.
p240_136|p240|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p240_308|p240|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p240_320|p240|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p240_334|p240|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p240_297|p240|Who did the recruiting?
p240_283|p240|People have no choice.
p240_268|p240|There is no link.
p240_254|p240|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p240_240|p240|But it's a subtle process.
p240_095|p240|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p240_081|p240|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p240_056|p240|He had no enemies.
p240_042|p240|Indeed, he does.
p240_019|p240|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p240_025|p240|Johnson was pretty low.
p240_031|p240|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p240_227|p240|I am immensely sad.
p240_233|p240|The body follows the mind.
p240_353|p240|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p240_347|p240|It is so unfair.
p240_179|p240|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p240_151|p240|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p240_145|p240|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p240_192|p240|People will ask about us.
p240_186|p240|They really did a great job.
p240_187|p240|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p240_193|p240|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p240_144|p240|I am just trying to do my job.
p240_150|p240|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p240_178|p240|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p240_346|p240|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p240_352|p240|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p240_232|p240|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p240_226|p240|What was the main difference?
p240_030|p240|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p240_024|p240|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p240_018|p240|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p240_032|p240|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p240_026|p240|But it failed.
p240_218|p240|Work has started.
p240_230|p240|It's so special.
p240_224|p240|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p240_378|p240|It's been hard.
p240_344|p240|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p240_146|p240|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p240_152|p240|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p240_185|p240|We want to help them through it.
p240_191|p240|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p240_190|p240|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p240_184|p240|What has caused the demise of singing?
p240_153|p240|Mr Blair had done well.
p240_147|p240|They did very well.
p240_351|p240|Look at the witnesses.
p240_345|p240|Three years ago he would have been.
p240_379|p240|It's now down in black and white.
p240_225|p240|But it will be sorted out this week.
p240_231|p240|They are the innocent victims.
p240_219|p240|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p240_027|p240|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p240_033|p240|This is the window.
p240_037|p240|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p240_023|p240|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p240_235|p240|And thought we would get away with it.
p240_221|p240|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p240_209|p240|We have an election in eight days.
p240_341|p240|Who was the mystery MP?
p240_355|p240|This is a friendly match?
p240_369|p240|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p240_143|p240|She died at her home.
p240_157|p240|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p240_180|p240|They will run a mile.
p240_194|p240|It is a farce.
p240_195|p240|I am totally surprised.
p240_181|p240|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p240_156|p240|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p240_142|p240|Who would be right?
p240_368|p240|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p240_354|p240|The composer will conduct.
p240_340|p240|I've not thought about it.
p240_208|p240|It's a mixture of everything.
p240_220|p240|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p240_234|p240|However, no further action was taken by police.
p240_022|p240|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p240_036|p240|It is marvellous.
p240_020|p240|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p240_034|p240|People love to see this stuff.
p240_008|p240|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p240_222|p240|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p240_236|p240|Jobs could go.
p240_342|p240|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p240_154|p240|I was in daily contact.
p240_140|p240|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p240_168|p240|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p240_197|p240|It wasn't to be.
p240_183|p240|Miller was every bit as happy.
p240_182|p240|They need to look after themselves.
p240_196|p240|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p240_169|p240|They will do their own thing.
p240_141|p240|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p240_155|p240|My Dad is a hero.
p240_380|p240|Safety was also an issue.
p240_343|p240|It is a sign of hope.
p240_357|p240|They should take their mobile phones.
p240_237|p240|It is not the message alone.
p240_223|p240|That has been the easy part.
p240_009|p240|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p240_035|p240|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p240_021|p240|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p240_038|p240|It has failed.
p240_004|p240|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p240_010|p240|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p240_206|p240|It's all about money, money, money.
p240_212|p240|She should not be blamed.
p240_372|p240|A deadline is still essential.
p240_366|p240|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p240_158|p240|Was this element always there?
p240_170|p240|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p240_164|p240|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p240_165|p240|Tell it like it was?
p240_171|p240|It's quite a routine.
p240_159|p240|These days are long gone.
p240_367|p240|As, indeed, they would be.
p240_373|p240|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p240_213|p240|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p240_207|p240|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p240_011|p240|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p240_005|p240|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p240_039|p240|They're just different.
p240_013|p240|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p240_007|p240|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p240_239|p240|It's very safe.
p240_211|p240|We'll have to work hard today.
p240_205|p240|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p240_359|p240|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p240_365|p240|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p240_371|p240|That would help.
p240_167|p240|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p240_173|p240|The hotel was now for sale.
p240_198|p240|There was no option.
p240_199|p240|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p240_172|p240|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p240_166|p240|We have a budget in March.
p240_370|p240|Hartley should know.
p240_364|p240|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p240_358|p240|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p240_204|p240|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p240_210|p240|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p240_238|p240|It's quite a line-up!
p240_006|p240|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p240_012|p240|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p240_016|p240|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p240_002|p240|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p240_214|p240|It had all been arranged.
p240_200|p240|But we are not immune to the problem.
p240_228|p240|It is a gamble.
p240_360|p240|He had played well in that central role.
p240_374|p240|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p240_348|p240|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p240_162|p240|I was in the train station overnight.
p240_176|p240|They know no other way.
p240_189|p240|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p240_188|p240|It is tough, but possible.
p240_177|p240|There is no point in looking any further.
p240_163|p240|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p240_349|p240|He has to learn.
p240_375|p240|We are looking for perfection.
p240_361|p240|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p240_229|p240|At the time, he was a living legend.
p240_201|p240|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p240_215|p240|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p240_003|p240|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p240_017|p240|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p240_001|p240|Please call Stella.  
p240_015|p240|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p240_029|p240|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p240_203|p240|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p240_217|p240|I was so nervous.
p240_377|p240|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p240_363|p240|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p240_175|p240|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p240_161|p240|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p240_149|p240|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p240_148|p240|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p240_160|p240|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p240_174|p240|I drove the ball well.
p240_362|p240|That is a break with tradition.
p240_376|p240|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p240_216|p240|His third goal was superb.
p240_202|p240|Who will pay for this?
p240_028|p240|Is this accurate?
p240_014|p240|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p240_067|p240|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p240_073|p240|I was as strong as a horse.
p240_098|p240|It was a good performance.
p240_259|p240|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p240_265|p240|It is also very valuable.
p240_271|p240|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p240_339|p240|I saw some good things.
p240_311|p240|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p240_305|p240|There was no hint of scandal.
p240_113|p240|This film will be totally awesome.
p240_107|p240|It's in his blood.
p240_106|p240|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
p240_112|p240|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p240_304|p240|I was the sheep.
p240_310|p240|We do not expect any surplus.
p240_338|p240|He was then replaced by Ross.
p240_270|p240|It looks as though he will be right.
p240_264|p240|They must play for each other.
p240_258|p240|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p240_099|p240|I see no need for change.
p240_072|p240|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p240_066|p240|They are real.
p240_058|p240|However the drama was still not at an end.
p240_070|p240|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p240_064|p240|Art is extra.
p240_272|p240|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p240_266|p240|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p240_299|p240|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p240_306|p240|The home was now under new management.
p240_312|p240|The plot is minimal.
p240_138|p240|We want to keep the pound.
p240_104|p240|That all hope is never lost.
p240_110|p240|I came to complete.
p240_111|p240|It's a question of perception.
p240_105|p240|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p240_139|p240|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p240_313|p240|And he goes with it.
p240_307|p240|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p240_298|p240|He was obviously very genuine.
p240_267|p240|Blood samples were taken.
p240_273|p240|Have a look at our accounts.
p240_065|p240|Scotland had great assets.
p240_071|p240|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p240_059|p240|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p240_075|p240|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p240_061|p240|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p240_049|p240|This represents a tough game for us.
p240_277|p240|Access has been a nightmare.
p240_263|p240|I was happily surprised.
p240_288|p240|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
p240_303|p240|He said she was mad.
p240_317|p240|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p240_101|p240|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p240_115|p240|I'm delighted about that.
p240_129|p240|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p240_128|p240|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p240_114|p240|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p240_100|p240|We have every respect for Michelle.
p240_316|p240|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p240_302|p240|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p240_289|p240|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p240_262|p240|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p240_276|p240|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p240_048|p240|That period was a struggle.
p240_060|p240|That's the truth.
p240_074|p240|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p240_062|p240|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p240_076|p240|She died in hospital two hours later.
p240_089|p240|They lived for their children.
p240_260|p240|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p240_274|p240|He was also married with two children.
p240_248|p240|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p240_314|p240|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p240_300|p240|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p240_328|p240|They had a confession.
p240_116|p240|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p240_102|p240|He takes the job.
p240_103|p240|They will want to perform well.
p240_117|p240|I joined a group.
p240_329|p240|We do the same.
p240_301|p240|A new school will be built.
p240_315|p240|It is no surprise.
p240_249|p240|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
p240_275|p240|And Michael was just great.
p240_261|p240|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p240_088|p240|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p240_077|p240|Is there a new way forward?
p240_063|p240|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p247_210|p247|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p247_006|p247|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p247_012|p247|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p247_199|p247|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p247_172|p247|It was by the numbers.
p247_166|p247|It has become a way of life.
p247_358|p247|The pain is still acute.
p247_416|p247|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p247_370|p247|He had no access to the database.
p247_364|p247|But we welcome this document.
p247_402|p247|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p247_365|p247|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p247_403|p247|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p247_417|p247|Shelter also supports the reform.
p247_371|p247|The members have voted against it.
p247_359|p247|He said something in his work.
p247_167|p247|There's always the next century.
p247_173|p247|We will turn the corner.
p247_198|p247|It caused a lot of upset.
p247_013|p247|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p247_007|p247|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p247_211|p247|January is a bad time of year.
p247_205|p247|The early physical reports were clear.
p247_239|p247|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p247_213|p247|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p247_207|p247|It gave no further details.
p247_039|p247|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p247_011|p247|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p247_005|p247|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p247_159|p247|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p247_165|p247|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p247_171|p247|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p247_398|p247|It is a simple equation.
p247_429|p247|Such an attack is bizarre.
p247_401|p247|It proved a good decision.
p247_367|p247|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p247_373|p247|Neither woman has been named.
p247_415|p247|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p247_372|p247|He had no previous convictions.
p247_414|p247|After the match, do you?
p247_400|p247|That investment has now been secured.
p247_366|p247|He can handle it without any problem.
p247_428|p247|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.
p247_399|p247|Ferguson must take the blame.
p247_170|p247|Nothing was meant by it.
p247_164|p247|That view has not altered.
p247_158|p247|Anyone can do the sums.
p247_004|p247|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p247_010|p247|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p247_038|p247|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p247_206|p247|The result is utterly compelling.
p247_212|p247|His injury was completely random.
p247_216|p247|was everything done to save people?
p247_202|p247|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p247_014|p247|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p247_028|p247|Because we do not need it.
p247_160|p247|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p247_174|p247|The strong pound also took its toll.
p247_148|p247|What happened in that game?
p247_389|p247|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p247_362|p247|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p247_404|p247|The BBC was a disgrace.
p247_410|p247|The casualties were not named.
p247_376|p247|That is a crazy situation.
p247_438|p247|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p247_439|p247|An alternative must be offered.
p247_411|p247|Does it matter?
p247_377|p247|Two things were clear from the new programme.
p247_363|p247|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p247_405|p247|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p247_388|p247|It benefits the whole family.
p247_149|p247|Are you going to win?
p247_175|p247|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p247_161|p247|His second goal was equally impressive.
p247_029|p247|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p247_001|p247|Please call Stella.  
p247_203|p247|Because he was born in England.
p247_217|p247|What was the matter for concern?
p247_215|p247|And they were being paid?
p247_229|p247|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p247_003|p247|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p247_017|p247|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p247_188|p247|Talks are at an advanced stage.
p247_177|p247|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p247_163|p247|He's not a Celtic man.
p247_375|p247|They have broken that promise.
p247_413|p247|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p247_407|p247|There was an element of frustration.
p247_361|p247|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
p247_349|p247|What do they want us to do?
p247_348|p247|Had this been common practice?
p247_406|p247|But the foundations have been laid.
p247_360|p247|It's wonderful to have won.
p247_374|p247|I got a yellow card.
p247_412|p247|How do you take them away?
p247_162|p247|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p247_176|p247|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p247_189|p247|They bought the property four years ago.
p247_016|p247|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p247_002|p247|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p247_228|p247|The transaction is not feasible.
p247_214|p247|I had relied on him.
p247_200|p247|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p247_298|p247|They were worth the money.
p247_267|p247|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p247_273|p247|Is our children learning?
p247_059|p247|So is that it, then?
p247_065|p247|We will pay their bills.
p247_071|p247|Final proposals will be published in February.
p247_139|p247|But it is different in different regions.
p247_111|p247|Our house was very small.
p247_105|p247|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p247_449|p247|He deserves a second chance.
p247_475|p247|The chief constable has retired.
p247_461|p247|It's because they can't understand the language.
p247_307|p247|But it has been an amazing experience.
p247_460|p247|The boys are mentally focused.
p247_306|p247|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p247_312|p247|I was there five months ago.
p247_474|p247|They were impressive against France.
p247_448|p247|There were no formal announcements.
p247_104|p247|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p247_110|p247|Before the game we went for a pint.
p247_138|p247|We did what we had to do.
p247_070|p247|It's not covered by the insurance.
p247_064|p247|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p247_058|p247|How are you, sir?
p247_272|p247|Do you think we are a top nation?
p247_266|p247|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p247_299|p247|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p247_258|p247|Labour was too busy to respond.
p247_270|p247|Does that put pressure on us?
p247_264|p247|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p247_099|p247|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p247_072|p247|You should try to have a laugh.
p247_066|p247|We could soon be in that same position!
p247_106|p247|Our preference is to play in midweek.
p247_112|p247|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p247_338|p247|It was an achievement all right.
p247_304|p247|He will address the nation this evening.
p247_462|p247|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p247_476|p247|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p247_310|p247|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p247_477|p247|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p247_311|p247|The effect was almost magical.
p247_305|p247|Tony Blair said as little.
p247_463|p247|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p247_339|p247|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p247_113|p247|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p247_107|p247|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p247_067|p247|It came as a surprise.
p247_073|p247|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p247_098|p247|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p247_265|p247|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p247_271|p247|Did it work?
p247_259|p247|You can never tell with the manager.
p247_275|p247|What form did that take?
p247_261|p247|Persuaded to change his mind.
p247_249|p247|Others agreed with this view.
p247_088|p247|Those people must be accountable.
p247_077|p247|I was as strong as a horse.
p247_063|p247|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p247_103|p247|She has so much to offer.
p247_117|p247|You had better believe it.
p247_467|p247|They're just a good retailer.
p247_301|p247|We will deliver at director level.
p247_315|p247|His job was not advertised.
p247_473|p247|We will now look into its historical background.
p247_329|p247|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
p247_328|p247|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p247_314|p247|Britain is going to celebrate in style.
p247_472|p247|And it covers the spectrum.
p247_466|p247|I think it's a great system.
p247_300|p247|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p247_116|p247|We deserve a significant rise.
p247_102|p247|But it is up again.
p247_062|p247|Why do it otherwise?
p247_076|p247|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p247_089|p247|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p247_248|p247|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p247_260|p247|We have no information on Iraq.
p247_274|p247|How independent is that?
p247_289|p247|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p247_262|p247|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p247_276|p247|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p247_060|p247|Do I have a favourite?
p247_074|p247|It wasn't possible to relax.
p247_048|p247|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p247_114|p247|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p247_100|p247|And they had a case.
p247_128|p247|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p247_470|p247|They were good years for him.
p247_316|p247|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p247_302|p247|I wanted to change the formula.
p247_464|p247|I'm very passionate about my country.
p247_458|p247|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
p247_459|p247|The damage is all inside.
p247_303|p247|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
p247_465|p247|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p247_471|p247|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p247_317|p247|He was obviously very genuine.
p247_129|p247|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p247_101|p247|It was clear on Thursday.
p247_115|p247|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p247_049|p247|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p247_075|p247|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p247_061|p247|What do we do?
p247_277|p247|He is quite well organised.
p247_263|p247|He has also cut a record.
p247_288|p247|None of this work is guaranteed.
p247_285|p247|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p247_291|p247|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p247_246|p247|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p247_252|p247|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p247_087|p247|I've had it for the exams.
p247_093|p247|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p247_078|p247|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p247_044|p247|Merger would be entirely logical.
p247_050|p247|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p247_118|p247|The website has changed the company.
p247_130|p247|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p247_124|p247|We have the mental strength.
p247_468|p247|That should get their attention.
p247_332|p247|They come to enjoy themselves.
p247_454|p247|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p247_440|p247|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p247_326|p247|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p247_441|p247|There is no hiding place.
p247_327|p247|Job losses were also announced.
p247_333|p247|The people will not be patient.
p247_455|p247|People are so negative about the whole business.
p247_469|p247|Now that business is banned.
p247_125|p247|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p247_131|p247|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p247_119|p247|This is a step backwards.
p247_051|p247|We would have concerns about suspension.
p247_045|p247|Everything is possible in football.
p247_079|p247|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p247_092|p247|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p247_086|p247|It makes for an interesting conference.
p247_253|p247|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p247_247|p247|I am not going to go tomorrow.
p247_290|p247|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p247_284|p247|These figures are truly terrible.
p247_292|p247|It was exactly four months away.
p247_286|p247|It is also very valuable.
p247_279|p247|It was a minor incident.
p247_251|p247|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p247_245|p247|Those overseas offices were great.
p247_090|p247|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p247_084|p247|The party is up for it.
p247_053|p247|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p247_047|p247|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p247_127|p247|I can't even get into the A team.
p247_133|p247|The answer was in space.
p247_319|p247|His appeal is instantly understood.
p247_325|p247|His only reply was a laugh.
p247_443|p247|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p247_457|p247|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
p247_331|p247|This is a moment to seize.
p247_456|p247|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.
p247_330|p247|The party lasted all night.
p247_324|p247|I was brought up in a mining background.
p247_442|p247|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p247_318|p247|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
p247_132|p247|Which can happen any time.
p247_126|p247|You can spend money on housing.
p247_046|p247|It's not a swimming pool out there.
p247_052|p247|The couple actually came upon the accident.
p247_085|p247|Even the one she loved.
p247_091|p247|We have to offer value for money.
p247_244|p247|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p247_250|p247|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.
p247_278|p247|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p247_287|p247|There's not much money in cycling.
p247_293|p247|I understand the security issue.
p247_297|p247|A revival is under way.
p247_283|p247|They must play for each other.
p247_254|p247|I have received no explanation.
p247_240|p247|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p247_268|p247|Messages have to be reinforced.
p247_095|p247|Potions said he would drive.
p247_081|p247|She died in hospital two hours later.
p247_056|p247|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p247_042|p247|They said she was stable.
p247_122|p247|However, the problem is timing.
p247_136|p247|This should begin in October.
p247_446|p247|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p247_320|p247|I first met him last summer.
p247_334|p247|And he goes with it.
p247_452|p247|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p247_308|p247|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p247_309|p247|The rescue package is public money.
p247_335|p247|Scotland has shown the way.
p247_453|p247|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
p247_447|p247|That will be best for him.
p247_321|p247|A Home Office spokesman said.
p247_137|p247|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p247_123|p247|It isn't a happy memory.
p247_043|p247|Among them are many criminals.
p247_057|p247|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p247_080|p247|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p247_094|p247|They lived for their children.
p247_269|p247|I didn't see the point.
p247_241|p247|She was an only child.
p247_255|p247|Mr Smith declined to comment.
p247_282|p247|There were no problems with the crowds.
p247_296|p247|It's hard to see it.
p247_280|p247|Scotland won by six wickets.
p247_294|p247|It was never a free kick.
p247_243|p247|They have to be able to play the game.
p247_257|p247|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p247_082|p247|It happens on an annual basis.
p247_096|p247|The woman is basically off her head.
p247_041|p247|The boy is no longer with us.
p247_055|p247|We have to keep our clients.
p247_069|p247|Only water is currently allowed.
p247_135|p247|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p247_121|p247|That might help a bit.
p247_109|p247|The following are the principal provisions.
p247_451|p247|But you can go beyond that condition.
p247_337|p247|We will listen to any suggestion.
p247_323|p247|There was no hint of scandal.
p247_445|p247|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p247_479|p247|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p247_322|p247|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p247_444|p247|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p247_450|p247|It certainly appeared that way.
p247_336|p247|Then followed a bout of flu.
p247_108|p247|We made a world record together.
p247_120|p247|There's still plenty time left.
p247_134|p247|But it could be a consequence of our policy.
p247_068|p247|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p247_054|p247|Italy is a beautiful place.
p247_040|p247|It is serious - but not that serious.
p247_097|p247|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p247_083|p247|It is a job creation scheme.
p247_256|p247|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p247_242|p247|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p247_295|p247|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p247_281|p247|They are interior designers and architects.
p247_219|p247|Is it in the right place?
p247_225|p247|I am considered a teenager.
p247_231|p247|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p247_027|p247|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p247_033|p247|It carried a double message.
p247_190|p247|The Royal Highland was no exception.
p247_184|p247|It is not either national standards or local control.
p247_153|p247|Does the name matter?
p247_147|p247|My daughter is an adult.
p247_392|p247|Rugby has an extended run.
p247_386|p247|The pair are very much in love.
p247_379|p247|The group is not paying a dividend.
p247_437|p247|We've made a couple of albums.
p247_351|p247|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p247_345|p247|Is there a waiting list?
p247_423|p247|That's been all around Europe with me.
p247_344|p247|What are they for?
p247_422|p247|The projections are very positive for South Africa.
p247_436|p247|There is another important factor.
p247_350|p247|Is it worth it?
p247_378|p247|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p247_387|p247|The team hadn't been picked.
p247_393|p247|It has happened for generations.
p247_146|p247|This represents a tough game for us.
p247_152|p247|What do we want to do that for?
p247_185|p247|City sentiment is in his favour.
p247_191|p247|I put the drawing down.
p247_032|p247|It is not for any other purpose.
p247_026|p247|Meetings will also remain private.
p247_230|p247|William Hague delighted his party.
p247_224|p247|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p247_218|p247|Do I think about them often?
p247_232|p247|We played them off the pitch.
p247_226|p247|The process will start tomorrow.
p247_018|p247|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p247_030|p247|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p247_024|p247|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p247_187|p247|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p247_193|p247|You know the sort of thing.
p247_178|p247|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p247_144|p247|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p247_150|p247|Was it the wife?
p247_385|p247|to have products for their needs.
p247_391|p247|He will consult the right people.
p247_408|p247|But they can also be managed by telephone.
p247_420|p247|That is not the position of the British relatives.
p247_346|p247|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p247_352|p247|There was some merit in that.
p247_434|p247|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p247_353|p247|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p247_435|p247|It's going to be epic.
p247_421|p247|He seems to be used to the attention.
p247_347|p247|So what happens next?
p247_409|p247|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p247_390|p247|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p247_384|p247|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p247_151|p247|Why change it?
p247_145|p247|You are a gambling man.
p247_179|p247|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p247_192|p247|I will have to order its destruction.
p247_186|p247|It is vital to clarify their role.
p247_025|p247|They are very clever in their use of words.
p247_031|p247|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p247_019|p247|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p247_227|p247|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p247_233|p247|It will be strictly cross-country.
p247_237|p247|The scientific debate is dead.
p247_223|p247|His third goal was superb.
p247_035|p247|That is the face of fear.
p247_021|p247|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p247_009|p247|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p247_182|p247|His team management was protective.
p247_196|p247|I'm interested in interesting work.
p247_141|p247|They made such decisions in London.
p247_155|p247|That is the ultimate revenge.
p247_169|p247|It is not normal practice.
p247_380|p247|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
p247_394|p247|Theatre is not a museum.
p247_343|p247|Are they free?
p247_425|p247|It was submitted without their knowledge.
p247_431|p247|No date has been fixed for his return.
p247_357|p247|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p247_419|p247|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p247_418|p247|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p247_430|p247|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.
p247_356|p247|Other people had looked at it.
p247_342|p247|It is inherent in society.
p247_424|p247|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p247_395|p247|He took over our lives.
p247_381|p247|The major championships will always have a special place.
p247_168|p247|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p247_154|p247|how do you get it back?
p247_140|p247|This is the highlight of my career.
p247_197|p247|We represent a wide range of society.
p247_183|p247|One season, they might do well.
p247_008|p247|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p247_020|p247|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p247_034|p247|The company did not declare a dividend.
p247_222|p247|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p247_236|p247|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p247_220|p247|Did he trip?
p247_234|p247|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p247_208|p247|This will take several weeks.
p247_022|p247|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p247_036|p247|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p247_195|p247|It shows the strength of the roots.
p247_181|p247|I always felt they played for me.
p247_156|p247|Before it was an ordeal.
p247_142|p247|I learned that only yesterday.
p247_397|p247|They have not done so this season so far.
p247_383|p247|It's as wide as a church in here.
p247_354|p247|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p247_432|p247|It was a breathtaking moment.
p247_426|p247|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p247_340|p247|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p247_368|p247|I think we'll just keep it.
p247_369|p247|It is a stroke of genius.
p247_427|p247|My aim is a top six finish.
p247_341|p247|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p247_355|p247|But the New Year was special.
p247_433|p247|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p247_382|p247|There is no deal as yet.
p247_396|p247|It seems a long time ago.
p247_143|p247|I have accepted the challenge.
p247_157|p247|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p247_180|p247|They could not match it.
p247_194|p247|They were seriously after him.
p247_037|p247|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p247_023|p247|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p247_209|p247|It was worth a photograph.
p247_235|p247|Truth is the child of time.
p247_221|p247|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p278_173|p278|What happened in that game?
p278_365|p278|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p278_403|p278|Clark is back on top form.
p278_371|p278|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p278_359|p278|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p278_211|p278|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p278_205|p278|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p278_239|p278|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p278_013|p278|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p278_007|p278|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p278_006|p278|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p278_012|p278|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p278_238|p278|I have spoken to the skipper.
p278_204|p278|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p278_210|p278|I won't make an official complaint.
p278_358|p278|A crucial moment has arrived.
p278_370|p278|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p278_364|p278|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p278_402|p278|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p278_172|p278|My life has been destroyed.
p278_166|p278|He is keen to stay in public service.
p278_199|p278|Last night was a key episode.
p278_170|p278|On my day I can beat anyone.
p278_164|p278|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p278_158|p278|These days are long gone.
p278_399|p278|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p278_372|p278|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p278_400|p278|There's still no-one like him.
p278_366|p278|We put our bid in last night.
p278_206|p278|We could soon be in that same position!
p278_212|p278|Bombing is the easy option.
p278_004|p278|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p278_010|p278|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p278_038|p278|Among them are many criminals.
p278_039|p278|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p278_011|p278|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p278_005|p278|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p278_213|p278|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p278_207|p278|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p278_401|p278|They know it'll be fantastic.
p278_367|p278|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p278_373|p278|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p278_398|p278|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p278_159|p278|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p278_165|p278|We have a budget in March.
p278_171|p278|We've made a couple of albums.
p278_149|p278|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p278_175|p278|Was it the wife?
p278_161|p278|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p278_388|p278|They will fight for everything.
p278_377|p278|The major championships will always have a special place.
p278_363|p278|His views are hardly surprising.
p278_405|p278|We must improve our relations with government.
p278_203|p278|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p278_217|p278|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p278_029|p278|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p278_015|p278|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p278_014|p278|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p278_028|p278|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p278_216|p278|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p278_202|p278|I came home by ambulance.
p278_362|p278|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p278_404|p278|I had a fortunate war.
p278_410|p278|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p278_376|p278|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p278_389|p278|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p278_160|p278|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p278_174|p278|Are you going to win?
p278_148|p278|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p278_189|p278|They need to look after themselves.
p278_162|p278|So was the first half.
p278_176|p278|Why change it?
p278_348|p278|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p278_406|p278|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p278_360|p278|Three years ago he would have been.
p278_374|p278|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p278_228|p278|how do you get it back?
p278_214|p278|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p278_200|p278|They are still very quiet.
p278_016|p278|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p278_002|p278|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p278_003|p278|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p278_017|p278|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p278_201|p278|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p278_215|p278|They make a selective perception process.
p278_229|p278|What are you not good at?
p278_375|p278|He must have seen the movie.
p278_407|p278|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p278_361|p278|But we welcome this document.
p278_349|p278|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p278_177|p278|What do we want to do that for?
p278_163|p278|It's never great to finish second.
p278_188|p278|That's not fair to the supporters.
p278_104|p278|Had I heard?
p278_110|p278|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p278_138|p278|It will affect their work.
p278_306|p278|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p278_312|p278|It's not covered by the insurance.
p278_299|p278|You have to expect this type of thing.
p278_272|p278|What was the matter for concern?
p278_266|p278|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p278_070|p278|Even the one she loved.
p278_064|p278|But it has been an amazing experience.
p278_058|p278|Let's hope that it does.
p278_059|p278|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
p278_065|p278|The judge was really nice.
p278_071|p278|It was a unanimous decision.
p278_267|p278|Messages have to be reinforced.
p278_273|p278|Do I think about them often?
p278_298|p278|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p278_313|p278|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p278_307|p278|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p278_139|p278|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p278_111|p278|He was jailed for a year.
p278_105|p278|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p278_113|p278|Football is a passion for many.
p278_107|p278|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p278_311|p278|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p278_305|p278|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p278_339|p278|We want to play at the worlds.
p278_265|p278|No production contract is yet in sight.
p278_271|p278|was everything done to save people?
p278_259|p278|You can feel at home in China.
p278_098|p278|Why do it otherwise?
p278_067|p278|The fans would love it.
p278_073|p278|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p278_072|p278|It's all going to clear the debt.
p278_066|p278|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p278_099|p278|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p278_258|p278|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p278_270|p278|And they were being paid?
p278_264|p278|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p278_338|p278|The letters are going out today.
p278_304|p278|John was there already in spirit.
p278_310|p278|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p278_106|p278|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p278_112|p278|They almost achieved a draw.
p278_116|p278|Maybe this battle has been.
p278_102|p278|And does it?
p278_328|p278|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p278_314|p278|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p278_300|p278|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p278_248|p278|A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
p278_260|p278|We have no information on Iraq.
p278_274|p278|Is it in the right place?
p278_089|p278|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p278_062|p278|Only water is currently allowed.
p278_076|p278|By then, he was walking on water.
p278_077|p278|We have to offer value for money.
p278_063|p278|I'm looking to the future.
p278_088|p278|But they must believe in themselves.
p278_275|p278|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p278_261|p278|Persuaded to change his mind.
p278_249|p278|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p278_301|p278|So the Government will be damaged.
p278_315|p278|You have to see it like this.
p278_329|p278|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p278_103|p278|Are you from the rugby?
p278_117|p278|That might help a bit.
p278_129|p278|This should begin in October.
p278_101|p278|So what is the campaign about?
p278_115|p278|It was located on the remote control.
p278_303|p278|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p278_317|p278|Holland won by five wickets.
p278_288|p278|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p278_277|p278|He was released after treatment.
p278_263|p278|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p278_049|p278|He will need that machine.
p278_075|p278|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p278_061|p278|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p278_060|p278|It was exactly four months away.
p278_074|p278|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p278_048|p278|Do I have a favourite?
p278_262|p278|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p278_276|p278|They are interior designers and architects.
p278_289|p278|Those overseas offices were great.
p278_316|p278|You have asked for action.
p278_302|p278|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p278_114|p278|I didn't think so either.
p278_100|p278|So, did she meet him?
p278_128|p278|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p278_125|p278|Which can happen any time.
p278_131|p278|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p278_119|p278|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
p278_327|p278|The dealer is on notice.
p278_333|p278|They come to enjoy themselves.
p278_290|p278|I understand the security issue.
p278_284|p278|The stage was set for a showdown.
p278_253|p278|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p278_247|p278|It had so much to do with output.
p278_092|p278|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p278_086|p278|It was clear on Thursday.
p278_051|p278|I had trouble with the producers.
p278_045|p278|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p278_079|p278|Mr Smith declined to comment.
p278_078|p278|It's so hard to shift.
p278_044|p278|He looks like an Afghan.
p278_050|p278|I have learned from him.
p278_087|p278|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p278_093|p278|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p278_246|p278|I need a publishing deal!
p278_252|p278|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p278_285|p278|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p278_291|p278|Truth is the child of time.
p278_332|p278|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p278_326|p278|McNaughton was not so sure.
p278_118|p278|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p278_130|p278|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p278_124|p278|This is a frightening development.
p278_132|p278|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p278_126|p278|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p278_330|p278|The party lasted all night.
p278_324|p278|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p278_318|p278|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p278_287|p278|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p278_293|p278|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p278_244|p278|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p278_250|p278|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p278_278|p278|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p278_085|p278|It was worth a photograph.
p278_091|p278|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p278_046|p278|How are you, sir?
p278_052|p278|He also presented You Bet!
p278_053|p278|People come to see the Highlands.
p278_047|p278|So is that it, then?
p278_090|p278|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p278_084|p278|Everyone had to play the game.
p278_279|p278|I'd never run for them.
p278_251|p278|There were no reports of casualties.
p278_245|p278|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p278_292|p278|It has become a way of life.
p278_286|p278|I'd like to report a murder.
p278_319|p278|The answer was in space.
p278_325|p278|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p278_331|p278|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p278_127|p278|We had another last Tuesday.
p278_133|p278|That would open the gates of hell.
p278_137|p278|Before it was an ordeal.
p278_123|p278|However, the problem is the timing.
p278_309|p278|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p278_335|p278|And he goes with it.
p278_321|p278|I first met him last summer.
p278_282|p278|These figures are truly terrible.
p278_296|p278|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p278_269|p278|We accept the new rules.
p278_241|p278|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p278_255|p278|They made such decisions in London.
p278_080|p278|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p278_094|p278|In the end we made too many errors.
p278_043|p278|Must be prepared to use it.
p278_057|p278|None has ever been found.
p278_056|p278|She said she was really sorry.
p278_042|p278|Well, the climate has changed.
p278_095|p278|That time is not now, however.
p278_081|p278|That was a great performance by the team.
p278_254|p278|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p278_240|p278|The statement contained no surprises.
p278_268|p278|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p278_297|p278|This is a great opportunity for us.
p278_283|p278|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p278_320|p278|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p278_334|p278|That meant the search was unlawful.
p278_308|p278|He will address the nation this evening.
p278_122|p278|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p278_136|p278|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p278_108|p278|We have got a race.
p278_120|p278|You can spend money on housing.
p278_134|p278|You've got to be vigilant.
p278_322|p278|The songs are just so good.
p278_336|p278|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
p278_295|p278|It was never a free kick.
p278_281|p278|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p278_256|p278|It seems a waste of talents.
p278_242|p278|This would include the GM food industry.
p278_097|p278|Our house was very small.
p278_083|p278|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p278_068|p278|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p278_054|p278|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
p278_040|p278|This will get their attention.
p278_041|p278|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p278_055|p278|We have not given up hope.
p278_069|p278|The party is up for it.
p278_082|p278|He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
p278_096|p278|We created so many chances.
p278_243|p278|My wife and family are the support system.
p278_257|p278|I was just getting over the time difference.
p278_280|p278|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p278_294|p278|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p278_337|p278|We are on a four-year mission.
p278_323|p278|The casting is as perfect.
p278_135|p278|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p278_121|p278|The hearing was due to continue today.
p278_109|p278|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p278_185|p278|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p278_191|p278|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p278_146|p278|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p278_152|p278|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p278_387|p278|This remains the party's policy.
p278_393|p278|The marshall at the turn was great.
p278_344|p278|Is there a waiting list?
p278_350|p278|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p278_378|p278|That is a break with tradition.
p278_230|p278|I think, therefore I am?
p278_224|p278|Twaddle is a case in point.
p278_218|p278|They have known the hard times.
p278_032|p278|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p278_026|p278|These decisions are not simple.
p278_027|p278|Life was like a timetable.
p278_033|p278|It carried a double message.
p278_219|p278|It was important to win the singles.
p278_225|p278|I'm just a regular person.
p278_231|p278|Who was she?
p278_379|p278|This decision is a farce.
p278_351|p278|And it was this one.
p278_345|p278|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
p278_392|p278|I always knew she was funny.
p278_386|p278|In due course the deal was done.
p278_153|p278|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
p278_147|p278|There's always the next century.
p278_190|p278|I've always been like that.
p278_184|p278|It is vital to clarify their role.
p278_192|p278|They were seriously after him.
p278_186|p278|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p278_151|p278|Nothing was meant by it.
p278_145|p278|It was his job to check.
p278_179|p278|His team management was protective.
p278_390|p278|The team hadn't been picked.
p278_384|p278|After the match, do you?
p278_353|p278|My view has now completely changed.
p278_347|p278|And he is immensely loyal.
p278_409|p278|The next few months will tell.
p278_227|p278|Does the name matter?
p278_233|p278|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p278_025|p278|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p278_031|p278|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p278_019|p278|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p278_018|p278|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p278_030|p278|The director will be present.
p278_024|p278|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p278_232|p278|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p278_226|p278|My daughter is an adult.
p278_408|p278|That is the ultimate revenge.
p278_346|p278|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p278_352|p278|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p278_385|p278|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p278_391|p278|One-third of the places are already taken.
p278_178|p278|I always felt they played for me.
p278_144|p278|I have always loved the countryside.
p278_150|p278|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
p278_187|p278|Says the Duke of York.
p278_193|p278|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p278_197|p278|However, this idea is never developed.
p278_183|p278|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p278_168|p278|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
p278_154|p278|It was by the numbers.
p278_140|p278|They could use a boost.
p278_395|p278|They have not got anyone.
p278_381|p278|Does it matter?
p278_356|p278|Finally came the moment of truth.
p278_342|p278|What form did that take?
p278_222|p278|His injury was completely random.
p278_236|p278|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p278_008|p278|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p278_020|p278|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p278_034|p278|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p278_035|p278|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p278_021|p278|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p278_009|p278|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p278_237|p278|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p278_223|p278|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p278_343|p278|What are they for?
p278_357|p278|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p278_380|p278|Is it worth it?
p278_394|p278|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p278_141|p278|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p278_155|p278|I knew he was good.
p278_169|p278|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p278_182|p278|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p278_196|p278|It caused a lot of upset.
p278_180|p278|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p278_194|p278|It shows the strength of the roots.
p278_143|p278|Others are not so sure.
p278_157|p278|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p278_382|p278|How do you take them away?
p278_396|p278|The law would appear to be on our side.
p278_369|p278|I was delighted to accept.
p278_341|p278|How independent is that?
p278_355|p278|He was at school in Devon.
p278_209|p278|I am very realistic about these things.
p278_235|p278|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p278_221|p278|January is a bad time of year.
p278_037|p278|It was a hell of a way to lose.
p278_023|p278|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p278_022|p278|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p278_036|p278|Several investments have already been made.
p278_220|p278|The only problem was the greens.
p278_234|p278|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p278_208|p278|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p278_354|p278|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p278_340|p278|Do you think we are a top nation?
p278_368|p278|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p278_397|p278|It has happened for generations.
p278_383|p278|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p278_156|p278|We will turn the corner.
p278_142|p278|Anyone can do the sums.
p278_195|p278|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p278_181|p278|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p271_010|p271|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p271_004|p271|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p271_038|p271|Indeed, he does.
p271_164|p271|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p271_170|p271|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p271_158|p271|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p271_399|p271|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p271_400|p271|It is full-scale.
p271_366|p271|It has only been rumours.
p271_372|p271|There is no signature.
p271_414|p271|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p271_428|p271|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p271_429|p271|We have the location, which is assured.
p271_373|p271|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p271_415|p271|But we finished the show.
p271_401|p271|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p271_367|p271|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p271_398|p271|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p271_159|p271|Words were not required.
p271_171|p271|Tell it like it was?
p271_165|p271|It has to be now.
p271_039|p271|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p271_005|p271|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p271_011|p271|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p271_207|p271|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p271_213|p271|You have a plan?
p271_205|p271|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p271_211|p271|I don't want to use it.
p271_239|p271|We are so proud.
p271_007|p271|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p271_013|p271|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p271_198|p271|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p271_173|p271|We have a budget in March.
p271_167|p271|As, indeed, they would be.
p271_417|p271|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p271_371|p271|It seems a long time ago.
p271_365|p271|Their time has gone.
p271_403|p271|It is an absolute nonsense.
p271_359|p271|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p271_358|p271|My husband was angry.
p271_364|p271|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p271_402|p271|He will be judged by his actions.
p271_416|p271|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p271_370|p271|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p271_166|p271|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p271_172|p271|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p271_199|p271|It is a farce.
p271_012|p271|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p271_006|p271|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p271_238|p271|They tried to give her advice.
p271_210|p271|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p271_204|p271|We believe a third party was involved.
p271_228|p271|I will win.
p271_200|p271|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p271_214|p271|It had all been arranged.
p271_002|p271|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p271_016|p271|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p271_189|p271|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p271_176|p271|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p271_162|p271|These days are long gone.
p271_348|p271|We have big ideas.
p271_374|p271|It became a national network.
p271_412|p271|He got his degree.
p271_406|p271|In a way he was.
p271_360|p271|It is a memorial.
p271_407|p271|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p271_361|p271|And he laughs.
p271_375|p271|I am a wealthy person.
p271_413|p271|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p271_349|p271|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p271_163|p271|I'd love to be like Peter.
p271_177|p271|It is really good news.
p271_188|p271|I've been there.
p271_017|p271|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p271_003|p271|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p271_215|p271|I had decided to quit the show.
p271_201|p271|I came home by ambulance.
p271_229|p271|I am immensely sad.
p271_217|p271|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p271_203|p271|It opened last month.
p271_029|p271|They have no history.
p271_015|p271|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p271_001|p271|Please call Stella.  
p271_149|p271|Note the date.
p271_161|p271|That includes the equipment?
p271_175|p271|You had to go and see him.
p271_388|p271|They deserved the win.
p271_439|p271|We are now up against it.
p271_363|p271|There was a substantial explosion.
p271_405|p271|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p271_411|p271|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p271_377|p271|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p271_410|p271|He scored a touchdown.
p271_376|p271|The BBC was a disgrace.
p271_362|p271|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p271_404|p271|They are not left wing.
p271_438|p271|Admission is free.
p271_389|p271|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p271_174|p271|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p271_160|p271|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p271_148|p271|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p271_014|p271|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p271_028|p271|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p271_202|p271|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p271_216|p271|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p271_271|p271|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p271_265|p271|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p271_259|p271|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p271_098|p271|It is annoying.
p271_073|p271|He was at home with his pals.
p271_067|p271|It's good news and long overdue.
p271_107|p271|That would be unlawful.
p271_113|p271|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p271_305|p271|This is a war over our home.
p271_311|p271|There is no excuse.
p271_339|p271|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p271_338|p271|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p271_310|p271|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p271_304|p271|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p271_112|p271|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p271_106|p271|They make a selective perception process.
p271_066|p271|They are real.
p271_072|p271|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p271_099|p271|It is home-grown.
p271_258|p271|That could be in place by next year.
p271_264|p271|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p271_270|p271|You take a risk.
p271_299|p271|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p271_266|p271|Blood samples were taken.
p271_272|p271|He was also married with two children.
p271_064|p271|Scotland had great assets.
p271_070|p271|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p271_058|p271|It's so awful.
p271_110|p271|She reflects a bit.
p271_104|p271|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
p271_138|p271|He should resign.
p271_312|p271|The letters are going out today.
p271_306|p271|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p271_448|p271|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
p271_449|p271|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p271_307|p271|The court had a number of empty seats.
p271_313|p271|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p271_139|p271|I was dead.
p271_105|p271|It is a love affair.
p271_111|p271|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p271_059|p271|It is unique.
p271_071|p271|Try to save us.
p271_065|p271|It's that kind of place.
p271_273|p271|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p271_267|p271|We shall rely on human beings.
p271_298|p271|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p271_288|p271|You've got to have both sides.
p271_263|p271|This is the first step.
p271_277|p271|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p271_049|p271|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p271_061|p271|That's the truth.
p271_075|p271|There could be a way back.
p271_129|p271|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p271_115|p271|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p271_101|p271|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p271_317|p271|We are a peaceful people.
p271_303|p271|They are wrong.
p271_302|p271|There is no openness.
p271_316|p271|My whole life has changed.
p271_100|p271|They are now divorced.
p271_114|p271|I am an actor.
p271_128|p271|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p271_074|p271|It's all I can do.
p271_060|p271|I expect a rapid response.
p271_048|p271|He is too weak to move.
p271_276|p271|That goes back a long way.
p271_262|p271|Is that a serious question?
p271_289|p271|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p271_248|p271|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p271_274|p271|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p271_260|p271|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p271_089|p271|They lived for their children.
p271_076|p271|Then followed a bout of flu.
p271_062|p271|Jobs could go.
p271_102|p271|I saw the whole thing.
p271_116|p271|It was the eighties.
p271_328|p271|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p271_300|p271|Nothing is safe.
p271_314|p271|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p271_315|p271|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p271_301|p271|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p271_329|p271|It is a job creation scheme.
p271_117|p271|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p271_103|p271|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p271_063|p271|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p271_077|p271|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p271_088|p271|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p271_261|p271|Chelsea was a great club.
p271_275|p271|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p271_249|p271|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p271_293|p271|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p271_287|p271|You feel very helpless.
p271_250|p271|It is hard won.
p271_244|p271|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p271_278|p271|She failed in her action.
p271_091|p271|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p271_085|p271|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p271_052|p271|Here's a clue.
p271_046|p271|Is a drug dealer?
p271_126|p271|The people will come.
p271_132|p271|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p271_324|p271|It will work.
p271_442|p271|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p271_330|p271|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p271_318|p271|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p271_319|p271|Henman has been warned.
p271_331|p271|Relief was beyond belief.
p271_325|p271|It's too horrible to think.
p271_443|p271|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p271_133|p271|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p271_127|p271|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p271_047|p271|There is no reason at all.
p271_053|p271|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p271_084|p271|A play is a set of actions.
p271_090|p271|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p271_279|p271|They seem to get away with it.
p271_245|p271|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p271_251|p271|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p271_286|p271|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p271_292|p271|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p271_284|p271|He looked very sharp.
p271_290|p271|It was a virus.
p271_247|p271|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p271_253|p271|The scene is about this?
p271_086|p271|Someone who cares
p271_092|p271|It is a lifeline.
p271_045|p271|Among them are many criminals.
p271_051|p271|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p271_079|p271|Is there a new way forward?
p271_131|p271|What will happen then?
p271_125|p271|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p271_119|p271|You had better believe it.
p271_333|p271|They should take their mobile phones.
p271_441|p271|We were used.
p271_327|p271|There was no time scale.
p271_440|p271|In it went.
p271_326|p271|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p271_332|p271|Is that an issue?
p271_454|p271|It's a miracle.
p271_118|p271|It is so sad.
p271_124|p271|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p271_130|p271|We work well together.
p271_078|p271|Neither it is.
p271_050|p271|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p271_044|p271|They said she was stable.
p271_093|p271|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p271_087|p271|By then, he was walking on water.
p271_252|p271|You can feel at home in China.
p271_246|p271|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p271_291|p271|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p271_285|p271|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p271_281|p271|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p271_295|p271|We are not going to forget.
p271_242|p271|It's quite nice.
p271_256|p271|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p271_083|p271|He is driven.
p271_097|p271|Then came the crunch.
p271_068|p271|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p271_040|p271|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p271_054|p271|I guess I was lucky, though.
p271_108|p271|We have an election in eight days.
p271_134|p271|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p271_120|p271|It's not fair.
p271_450|p271|Was it worth it?
p271_336|p271|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p271_322|p271|They had a confession.
p271_444|p271|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p271_323|p271|We are in the end game.
p271_445|p271|They were not even allowed to see them.
p271_451|p271|It was ignored.
p271_337|p271|Who will do it?
p271_121|p271|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p271_135|p271|It was very frightened and dirty.
p271_109|p271|He takes the job.
p271_055|p271|I was inspired by two things.
p271_041|p271|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p271_069|p271|We should have known.
p271_096|p271|This one did.
p271_082|p271|He is in the queue.
p271_257|p271|The concerns are the same.
p271_243|p271|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p271_294|p271|This is a national crisis.
p271_280|p271|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p271_296|p271|No Briton has ever won.
p271_282|p271|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p271_269|p271|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p271_255|p271|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p271_241|p271|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p271_094|p271|He was possessed
p271_080|p271|The party is up for it.
p271_057|p271|I love the Dome.
p271_043|p271|I hate the word.
p271_123|p271|Who would have?
p271_137|p271|My daughter is an adult.
p271_309|p271|The plot is minimal.
p271_447|p271|Bill is a mentor.
p271_321|p271|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p271_335|p271|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p271_453|p271|It had been in place since last July.
p271_334|p271|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p271_452|p271|It is bizarre.
p271_446|p271|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p271_320|p271|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p271_308|p271|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p271_136|p271|Is that it?
p271_122|p271|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p271_042|p271|We will push.
p271_056|p271|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p271_081|p271|Even the one she loved.
p271_095|p271|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p271_240|p271|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p271_254|p271|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p271_268|p271|This is a question of Islam.
p271_283|p271|We are a grandmother.
p271_297|p271|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p271_233|p271|At the time, he was a living legend.
p271_227|p271|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p271_031|p271|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p271_025|p271|She looked so young.
p271_019|p271|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p271_186|p271|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p271_192|p271|What has caused the demise of singing?
p271_145|p271|He realises his mistake.
p271_151|p271|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p271_179|p271|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p271_384|p271|It's a real problem.
p271_390|p271|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p271_421|p271|The service from the other players was super.
p271_347|p271|I got a yellow card.
p271_353|p271|It is not like us.
p271_435|p271|It is not either national standards or local control.
p271_409|p271|The weekly average was three hours.
p271_408|p271|It might be.
p271_352|p271|Until they came to do it.
p271_434|p271|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p271_420|p271|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p271_346|p271|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p271_391|p271|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p271_385|p271|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p271_178|p271|He was a crazy man.
p271_150|p271|So I got a blood test.
p271_144|p271|She died at her home.
p271_193|p271|One was a lawyer.
p271_187|p271|The goals were good.
p271_018|p271|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p271_024|p271|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p271_030|p271|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p271_226|p271|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p271_232|p271|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p271_224|p271|He seemed to lose his focus.
p271_230|p271|It's not before time.
p271_218|p271|I might come back.
p271_026|p271|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p271_032|p271|I'd just like to play.
p271_191|p271|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p271_185|p271|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p271_152|p271|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p271_146|p271|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p271_393|p271|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p271_387|p271|It is unusual.
p271_436|p271|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p271_350|p271|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p271_344|p271|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p271_422|p271|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p271_378|p271|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p271_379|p271|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p271_345|p271|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p271_423|p271|Paris is not only young.
p271_437|p271|We are all equal.
p271_351|p271|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p271_386|p271|Who will provide the wine?
p271_392|p271|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p271_147|p271|I was awful.
p271_153|p271|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p271_184|p271|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p271_190|p271|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p271_033|p271|This is the window.
p271_027|p271|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p271_219|p271|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p271_231|p271|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p271_225|p271|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p271_209|p271|It was worth a photograph.
p271_221|p271|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p271_235|p271|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p271_023|p271|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p271_037|p271|It was clear.
p271_194|p271|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p271_180|p271|One season, they might do well.
p271_157|p271|My Dad is a hero.
p271_143|p271|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p271_396|p271|It will take place in July.
p271_382|p271|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p271_369|p271|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p271_355|p271|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p271_433|p271|Everything has collapsed.
p271_427|p271|I'm very grateful.
p271_341|p271|This is a big advantage.
p271_426|p271|It was like someone had died.
p271_340|p271|I've got no secret.
p271_354|p271|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p271_432|p271|I know the worry over Iraq.
p271_368|p271|The death rates are still as high.
p271_383|p271|Yet the data is compelling.
p271_397|p271|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p271_142|p271|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p271_156|p271|Work has started.
p271_181|p271|As we worked.
p271_195|p271|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p271_036|p271|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p271_022|p271|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p271_234|p271|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p271_220|p271|That idea is rubbish.
p271_208|p271|He had suffered a heart attack.
p271_236|p271|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p271_222|p271|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p271_008|p271|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p271_034|p271|I feel I did not have enough time.
p271_020|p271|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p271_183|p271|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p271_197|p271|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p271_168|p271|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p271_140|p271|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p271_154|p271|The weather forecast isn't good.
p271_381|p271|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p271_395|p271|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p271_418|p271|That may be.
p271_342|p271|went on sale.
p271_424|p271|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p271_430|p271|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p271_356|p271|We will be homeless.
p271_431|p271|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p271_357|p271|That would help.
p271_343|p271|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p271_425|p271|He is to appeal.
p271_419|p271|It is legally binding.
p271_394|p271|But we are a young side.
p271_380|p271|That's the name of the game, though.
p271_155|p271|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p271_141|p271|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p271_169|p271|They are not advertised.
p271_196|p271|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p271_182|p271|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p271_021|p271|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p271_035|p271|We speak about the performance.
p271_009|p271|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p271_223|p271|We could easily be cut again.
p271_237|p271|We were awful.
p285_011|p285|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p285_005|p285|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p285_039|p285|Indeed, he does.
p285_165|p285|Tell it like it was?
p285_171|p285|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p285_159|p285|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p285_398|p285|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p285_401|p285|What was the difference between them?
p285_367|p285|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p285_373|p285|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p285_372|p285|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p285_400|p285|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p285_366|p285|It seems a long time ago.
p285_399|p285|Is that possible?
p285_158|p285|I will tell you.
p285_170|p285|He was a crazy man.
p285_164|p285|They are not advertised.
p285_038|p285|It was clear.
p285_004|p285|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p285_010|p285|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p285_206|p285|Twaddle is a case in point.
p285_212|p285|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p285_204|p285|There was an e-mail.
p285_210|p285|In each case they were a goal down.
p285_238|p285|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p285_006|p285|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p285_012|p285|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p285_199|p285|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p285_172|p285|One season, they might do well.
p285_166|p285|Seven people were later detained by police.
p285_370|p285|There is no signature.
p285_364|p285|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p285_402|p285|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p285_358|p285|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p285_359|p285|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p285_365|p285|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p285_403|p285|Emotions were complex.
p285_371|p285|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p285_167|p285|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p285_173|p285|As we worked.
p285_198|p285|The service from the other players was super.
p285_013|p285|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p285_007|p285|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p285_239|p285|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p285_211|p285|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p285_205|p285|He knows a lot.
p285_229|p285|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p285_201|p285|Today was first class.
p285_215|p285|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p285_003|p285|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p285_017|p285|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p285_188|p285|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p285_177|p285|I drove the ball well.
p285_163|p285|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p285_349|p285|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p285_375|p285|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p285_361|p285|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p285_360|p285|This is a club on the rise.
p285_374|p285|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p285_348|p285|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p285_162|p285|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p285_176|p285|My players are special.
p285_189|p285|There is no openness.
p285_016|p285|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p285_002|p285|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p285_214|p285|People should make their own decisions.
p285_200|p285|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p285_228|p285|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p285_216|p285|Because they didn't want to know.
p285_202|p285|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p285_028|p285|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p285_014|p285|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p285_148|p285|I was on a roll.
p285_160|p285|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p285_174|p285|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p285_389|p285|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p285_362|p285|They believed it worked.
p285_376|p285|Something is wrong.
p285_377|p285|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
p285_363|p285|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p285_388|p285|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p285_175|p285|It is not either national standards or local control.
p285_161|p285|As, indeed, they would be.
p285_149|p285|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p285_001|p285|Please call Stella.  
p285_015|p285|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p285_029|p285|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p285_203|p285|I don't want to use it.
p285_217|p285|That has been the easy part.
p285_270|p285|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p285_264|p285|He was also married with two children.
p285_258|p285|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p285_099|p285|No, the equipment is extra.
p285_072|p285|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p285_066|p285|The death rates are still as high.
p285_106|p285|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p285_112|p285|It is so sad.
p285_304|p285|It needs a team approach.
p285_310|p285|We are a peaceful people.
p285_338|p285|I'm very lucky.
p285_339|p285|Our policy is clear.
p285_311|p285|Hartley should know.
p285_305|p285|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p285_113|p285|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p285_107|p285|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p285_067|p285|I had my suspicions.
p285_073|p285|What has changed?
p285_098|p285|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p285_259|p285|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p285_265|p285|The system can work.
p285_271|p285|It was very fast.
p285_298|p285|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p285_267|p285|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p285_273|p285|They seem to get away with it.
p285_065|p285|There could be a way back.
p285_071|p285|It's now down in black and white.
p285_059|p285|They are real.
p285_111|p285|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p285_105|p285|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p285_139|p285|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p285_313|p285|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p285_307|p285|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p285_306|p285|There is no excuse.
p285_312|p285|Henman has been warned.
p285_138|p285|Who would be right?
p285_104|p285|It was an interesting thing to do.
p285_110|p285|It was the eighties.
p285_058|p285|It's that kind of place.
p285_070|p285|Even the one she loved.
p285_064|p285|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p285_272|p285|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p285_266|p285|We are happy.
p285_299|p285|They are wrong.
p285_289|p285|Who can predict?
p285_262|p285|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p285_276|p285|She looked so young.
p285_048|p285|Here's a clue.
p285_060|p285|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p285_074|p285|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p285_128|p285|We work well together.
p285_114|p285|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p285_100|p285|We have an election in eight days.
p285_316|p285|It will work.
p285_302|p285|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p285_303|p285|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p285_317|p285|I came into this world with nothing.
p285_101|p285|Oil embargo endorsed.
p285_115|p285|It is rubbish.
p285_129|p285|It's not true.
p285_075|p285|He is in the queue.
p285_061|p285|We should have known.
p285_049|p285|I was lost.
p285_277|p285|It's so awful.
p285_263|p285|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p285_288|p285|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p285_249|p285|There's the mix.
p285_275|p285|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p285_261|p285|Souter will be back.
p285_088|p285|But I was wrong.
p285_077|p285|All options are open.
p285_063|p285|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p285_103|p285|She reflects a bit.
p285_117|p285|We enjoyed it today.
p285_329|p285|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p285_301|p285|This is a war over our home.
p285_315|p285|A review is under way.
p285_314|p285|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p285_300|p285|It could work.
p285_328|p285|The outcome is not in doubt.
p285_116|p285|Who would be a referee?
p285_102|p285|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p285_062|p285|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p285_076|p285|He is driven.
p285_089|p285|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p285_260|p285|There's not much money in cycling.
p285_274|p285|I feel pretty good.
p285_248|p285|It was a hit.
p285_292|p285|He was at home with his pals.
p285_286|p285|We are not going to forget.
p285_251|p285|The concerns are the same.
p285_245|p285|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p285_279|p285|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p285_090|p285|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p285_084|p285|This is the start of our season.
p285_053|p285|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p285_047|p285|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p285_127|p285|I am now unemployed.
p285_133|p285|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p285_325|p285|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p285_331|p285|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p285_319|p285|Off with their heads.
p285_318|p285|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p285_330|p285|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p285_324|p285|It's not long enough.
p285_132|p285|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p285_126|p285|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p285_046|p285|He looks like an Afghan.
p285_052|p285|There was no safety net.
p285_085|p285|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p285_091|p285|I saw the whole thing.
p285_278|p285|He looked very sharp.
p285_244|p285|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p285_250|p285|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p285_287|p285|No Briton has ever won.
p285_293|p285|What has altered?
p285_285|p285|Who did the recruiting?
p285_291|p285|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p285_246|p285|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p285_252|p285|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p285_087|p285|We knew they could do it.
p285_093|p285|It was mayhem.
p285_044|p285|Is a drug dealer?
p285_050|p285|It's a miracle.
p285_078|p285|I was too young.
p285_130|p285|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p285_124|p285|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p285_118|p285|She does not want to speak.
p285_332|p285|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p285_326|p285|He scored a touchdown.
p285_327|p285|The party is up for it.
p285_333|p285|Three years ago he would have been.
p285_119|p285|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p285_125|p285|No production was achieved.
p285_131|p285|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p285_079|p285|Someone who cares
p285_051|p285|I love the Dome.
p285_045|p285|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p285_092|p285|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p285_086|p285|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p285_253|p285|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p285_247|p285|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p285_290|p285|There was a vacuum.
p285_284|p285|It was good.
p285_280|p285|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p285_294|p285|I was brought up in a mining background.
p285_243|p285|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p285_257|p285|Is that a serious question?
p285_082|p285|They lived for their children.
p285_096|p285|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p285_069|p285|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p285_041|p285|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p285_055|p285|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p285_109|p285|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p285_135|p285|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p285_121|p285|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p285_337|p285|went on sale.
p285_323|p285|Either team will be hard.
p285_322|p285|Our message was inclusive.
p285_336|p285|I've got no secret.
p285_120|p285|There were no grounds for his action.
p285_134|p285|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p285_108|p285|Is that right?
p285_054|p285|That's the truth.
p285_040|p285|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p285_068|p285|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p285_097|p285|They tried to deny it.
p285_083|p285|It will be tight.
p285_256|p285|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p285_242|p285|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p285_295|p285|She is really magic.
p285_281|p285|He will address the nation this evening.
p285_297|p285|One was a lawyer.
p285_283|p285|Who will perform?
p285_268|p285|We're in shock.
p285_254|p285|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p285_240|p285|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p285_095|p285|It is a love affair.
p285_081|p285|It is a blow.
p285_056|p285|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p285_042|p285|Sure, it's funny.
p285_122|p285|She really suffered for her art.
p285_136|p285|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p285_308|p285|The letters are going out today.
p285_320|p285|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p285_334|p285|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p285_335|p285|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p285_321|p285|There was no time scale.
p285_309|p285|She is very distinctive.
p285_137|p285|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p285_123|p285|It is not a U-turn.
p285_043|p285|This represents a tough game for us.
p285_057|p285|Scotland had great assets.
p285_080|p285|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p285_094|p285|Journalists should make him.
p285_241|p285|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
p285_255|p285|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p285_269|p285|Of course I was tempted.
p285_282|p285|Yet, it worked.
p285_296|p285|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p285_232|p285|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p285_226|p285|At the time, he was a living legend.
p285_030|p285|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p285_024|p285|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p285_018|p285|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p285_187|p285|What has caused the demise of singing?
p285_193|p285|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p285_144|p285|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p285_150|p285|We are on a four-year mission.
p285_178|p285|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p285_385|p285|They deserved the win.
p285_391|p285|They are good.
p285_346|p285|I HAVE a dream.
p285_352|p285|The pair are very much in love.
p285_353|p285|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p285_347|p285|There may be reasons for it.
p285_390|p285|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p285_384|p285|It's just outrageous.
p285_179|p285|The goals were good.
p285_151|p285|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p285_145|p285|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p285_192|p285|It caused a lot of upset.
p285_186|p285|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p285_019|p285|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p285_025|p285|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p285_031|p285|There's a story, too.
p285_227|p285|My wife and family are the support system.
p285_233|p285|Wealth is relative.
p285_225|p285|But she was.
p285_231|p285|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p285_219|p285|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p285_027|p285|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p285_033|p285|He was jailed for five years.
p285_190|p285|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p285_184|p285|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p285_153|p285|My Dad is a hero.
p285_147|p285|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p285_392|p285|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p285_386|p285|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p285_351|p285|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p285_345|p285|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p285_379|p285|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p285_378|p285|You can cope with it.
p285_344|p285|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p285_350|p285|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p285_387|p285|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p285_393|p285|But we are a young side.
p285_146|p285|The weather forecast isn't good.
p285_152|p285|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p285_185|p285|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p285_191|p285|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p285_032|p285|This is the window.
p285_026|p285|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p285_218|p285|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p285_230|p285|They tried to give her advice.
p285_224|p285|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p285_208|p285|It's not ideal.
p285_220|p285|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p285_234|p285|You should be.
p285_022|p285|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p285_036|p285|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p285_195|p285|I came home by ambulance.
p285_181|p285|Nothing is safe.
p285_156|p285|That includes the equipment?
p285_142|p285|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p285_397|p285|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p285_383|p285|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p285_368|p285|So there, we won.
p285_354|p285|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p285_340|p285|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p285_341|p285|I will miss him.
p285_355|p285|We will be homeless.
p285_369|p285|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p285_382|p285|Yet the data is compelling.
p285_396|p285|What happened in the summer?
p285_143|p285|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p285_157|p285|Well, he should know.
p285_180|p285|His name was unknown.
p285_194|p285|It's a fact.
p285_037|p285|They're just different.
p285_023|p285|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p285_235|p285|It's quite nice.
p285_221|p285|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p285_209|p285|We want to keep the pound.
p285_237|p285|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p285_223|p285|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p285_009|p285|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p285_035|p285|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p285_021|p285|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p285_182|p285|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p285_196|p285|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p285_169|p285|I carried on for him.
p285_141|p285|That group reported just before Christmas.
p285_155|p285|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p285_380|p285|At the last I found a bunker.
p285_394|p285|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p285_343|p285|I got a yellow card.
p285_357|p285|It is a memorial.
p285_356|p285|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p285_342|p285|They should take their mobile phones.
p285_395|p285|It will take place in July.
p285_381|p285|It is the old story.
p285_154|p285|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p285_140|p285|I was awful.
p285_168|p285|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p285_197|p285|We live by the rule of law.
p285_183|p285|Many innocent people will die.
p285_020|p285|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p285_034|p285|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p285_008|p285|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p285_222|p285|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p285_236|p285|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p282_079|p282|People must remain vigilant.
p282_092|p282|We are on the path of change.
p282_086|p282|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p282_253|p282|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p282_247|p282|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p282_290|p282|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p282_284|p282|This is a national crisis.
p282_327|p282|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p282_333|p282|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p282_125|p282|There were no grounds for his action.
p282_131|p282|I am now unemployed.
p282_119|p282|It is rubbish.
p282_118|p282|The mood is upbeat.
p282_130|p282|No production was achieved.
p282_124|p282|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p282_332|p282|This is a friendly match?
p282_326|p282|Three years ago he would have been.
p282_285|p282|Who did the recruiting?
p282_291|p282|Nothing is safe.
p282_246|p282|It was a hit.
p282_252|p282|they fail to engage.
p282_087|p282|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p282_093|p282|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p282_078|p282|The party is up for it.
p282_044|p282|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p282_050|p282|A neighbour said.
p282_046|p282|It's the only thing.
p282_052|p282|There is no reason at all.
p282_085|p282|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p282_091|p282|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p282_244|p282|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p282_250|p282|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p282_278|p282|You've got to have both sides.
p282_287|p282|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p282_293|p282|One was a lawyer.
p282_330|p282|I've got no secret.
p282_324|p282|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p282_318|p282|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p282_132|p282|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p282_126|p282|I'm so angry.
p282_127|p282|She really suffered for her art.
p282_133|p282|It plans to return to this field.
p282_319|p282|Feel the air, the space.
p282_325|p282|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p282_331|p282|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p282_292|p282|But it's a subtle process.
p282_286|p282|She is really magic.
p282_279|p282|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p282_251|p282|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p282_245|p282|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p282_090|p282|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p282_084|p282|I first met him last summer.
p282_053|p282|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p282_047|p282|You had better believe it.
p282_043|p282|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p282_057|p282|I was lost.
p282_080|p282|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p282_094|p282|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p282_269|p282|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p282_241|p282|The scene is about this?
p282_255|p282|They must play for each other.
p282_282|p282|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p282_296|p282|They are wrong.
p282_309|p282|She is very distinctive.
p282_335|p282|They should take their mobile phones.
p282_321|p282|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p282_137|p282|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p282_123|p282|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p282_122|p282|We enjoyed it today.
p282_136|p282|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p282_320|p282|Is there a new way forward?
p282_334|p282|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p282_308|p282|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p282_297|p282|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p282_283|p282|Who will perform?
p282_254|p282|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p282_240|p282|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p282_268|p282|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p282_095|p282|Yet, it worked.
p282_081|p282|What has changed?
p282_056|p282|Here's a clue.
p282_042|p282|Dancing was her life.
p282_068|p282|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p282_054|p282|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p282_040|p282|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p282_097|p282|I love the Dome.
p282_083|p282|He is in the queue.
p282_256|p282|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p282_242|p282|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p282_295|p282|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p282_281|p282|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p282_322|p282|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p282_336|p282|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p282_108|p282|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p282_120|p282|Who would be a referee?
p282_134|p282|We work well together.
p282_135|p282|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p282_121|p282|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p282_109|p282|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p282_337|p282|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p282_323|p282|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p282_280|p282|Dialogue is the key.
p282_294|p282|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p282_243|p282|My son was too young to die.
p282_257|p282|There's not much money in cycling.
p282_082|p282|I will miss him.
p282_096|p282|He's been hit by it.
p282_041|p282|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p282_055|p282|Our people are ready.
p282_069|p282|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p282_032|p282|Help is needed.
p282_026|p282|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p282_230|p282|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p282_224|p282|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p282_218|p282|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p282_344|p282|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p282_350|p282|That would help.
p282_146|p282|Who would have?
p282_152|p282|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p282_185|p282|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p282_191|p282|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p282_190|p282|It caused a lot of upset.
p282_184|p282|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p282_153|p282|The weather forecast isn't good.
p282_147|p282|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p282_351|p282|My husband was angry.
p282_345|p282|As, indeed, they would be.
p282_219|p282|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p282_225|p282|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p282_231|p282|We are so proud.
p282_027|p282|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p282_033|p282|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p282_025|p282|But it failed.
p282_031|p282|He was jailed for five years.
p282_227|p282|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p282_233|p282|Of course I was tempted.
p282_353|p282|And he laughs.
p282_347|p282|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p282_151|p282|I was stunned.
p282_145|p282|I was awful.
p282_179|p282|The goals were good.
p282_192|p282|We speak about the performance.
p282_186|p282|Does this matter?
p282_187|p282|Our team is just so young.
p282_193|p282|It is a farce.
p282_178|p282|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p282_144|p282|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p282_150|p282|There was a substantial explosion.
p282_346|p282|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p282_352|p282|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p282_232|p282|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p282_226|p282|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p282_018|p282|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p282_030|p282|This is the window.
p282_024|p282|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p282_020|p282|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p282_034|p282|It is marvellous.
p282_222|p282|I'd never seen a play about me.
p282_236|p282|The minister is the engineer.
p282_356|p282|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p282_342|p282|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p282_168|p282|I was in the train station overnight.
p282_154|p282|They have not been named.
p282_140|p282|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p282_197|p282|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p282_183|p282|They need to look after themselves.
p282_182|p282|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p282_196|p282|I came home by ambulance.
p282_141|p282|She died at her home.
p282_155|p282|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p282_169|p282|We have a budget in March.
p282_343|p282|Yet he left a few days later.
p282_357|p282|Their time has gone.
p282_237|p282|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p282_223|p282|It's not before time.
p282_035|p282|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p282_021|p282|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p282_009|p282|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p282_037|p282|They're just different.
p282_023|p282|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p282_209|p282|It had all been arranged.
p282_235|p282|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p282_221|p282|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p282_369|p282|Colour was at the core of his life.
p282_341|p282|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p282_355|p282|This is a club on the rise.
p282_143|p282|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p282_157|p282|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p282_180|p282|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p282_194|p282|Peace was won.
p282_195|p282|It's a fact.
p282_181|p282|It's an idea.
p282_156|p282|My Dad is a hero.
p282_142|p282|He realises his mistake.
p282_354|p282|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p282_340|p282|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p282_368|p282|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p282_220|p282|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p282_234|p282|It's quite a line-up!
p282_208|p282|Twaddle is a case in point.
p282_022|p282|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p282_036|p282|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p282_013|p282|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p282_007|p282|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p282_211|p282|Work has started.
p282_205|p282|We have an election in eight days.
p282_239|p282|Our policy is clear.
p282_365|p282|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p282_359|p282|The death rates are still as high.
p282_167|p282|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p282_173|p282|In a way he was.
p282_198|p282|Is that success?
p282_199|p282|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p282_172|p282|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p282_166|p282|It has to be now.
p282_358|p282|He could make it.
p282_370|p282|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p282_364|p282|It is a simple equation.
p282_238|p282|It is hard won.
p282_204|p282|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p282_210|p282|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p282_006|p282|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p282_012|p282|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p282_004|p282|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p282_010|p282|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p282_038|p282|It was clear.
p282_206|p282|Feel the heat?
p282_212|p282|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p282_366|p282|It was a funny game.
p282_170|p282|We should do everything at a stroke.
p282_164|p282|I'd love to be like Peter.
p282_158|p282|Words were not required.
p282_159|p282|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p282_165|p282|I've put my own money into this project.
p282_171|p282|You had to go and see him.
p282_367|p282|There wasn't a goal.
p282_213|p282|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p282_207|p282|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p282_039|p282|Indeed, he does.
p282_011|p282|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p282_005|p282|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p282_029|p282|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p282_015|p282|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p282_203|p282|It was worth a photograph.
p282_217|p282|Then another one came.
p282_363|p282|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p282_149|p282|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p282_175|p282|Blair's response was weak.
p282_161|p282|Well, he should know.
p282_160|p282|Life becomes a song.
p282_174|p282|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p282_148|p282|It is not just about pay.
p282_362|p282|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p282_216|p282|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p282_202|p282|Sadly, it can't.
p282_014|p282|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p282_028|p282|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p282_016|p282|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p282_002|p282|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p282_228|p282|My wife and family are the support system.
p282_214|p282|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p282_200|p282|Who will pay for this?
p282_348|p282|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p282_360|p282|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p282_162|p282|Was this element always there?
p282_176|p282|As we worked.
p282_189|p282|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p282_188|p282|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p282_177|p282|We are the gateway to justice.
p282_163|p282|These days are long gone.
p282_361|p282|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p282_349|p282|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p282_201|p282|It's all about money, money, money.
p282_215|p282|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p282_229|p282|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p282_003|p282|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p282_017|p282|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p282_070|p282|But I've won both ways.
p282_064|p282|That's the truth.
p282_058|p282|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p282_272|p282|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p282_266|p282|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p282_299|p282|It could work.
p282_306|p282|Is there on his hands?
p282_312|p282|Henman has been warned.
p282_104|p282|That would be unlawful.
p282_110|p282|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p282_138|p282|I was dead.
p282_139|p282|I don't know the full story.
p282_111|p282|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p282_105|p282|I don't want to use it.
p282_313|p282|We are in the end game.
p282_307|p282|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p282_298|p282|There were no passengers on board.
p282_267|p282|One knows the feeling.
p282_273|p282|She looked so young.
p282_059|p282|My fitness was very poor.
p282_065|p282|It seems to have worked.
p282_071|p282|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p282_067|p282|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p282_073|p282|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p282_098|p282|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p282_265|p282|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p282_271|p282|She failed in her action.
p282_259|p282|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p282_311|p282|You may have a short memory.
p282_305|p282|The letters are going out today.
p282_339|p282|She is free.
p282_113|p282|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p282_107|p282|It was an adventure.
p282_106|p282|Oil embargo endorsed.
p282_112|p282|Is that right?
p282_338|p282|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p282_304|p282|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p282_310|p282|We have got to get the points from this one.
p282_258|p282|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p282_270|p282|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p282_264|p282|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p282_099|p282|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p282_072|p282|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p282_066|p282|This is the first step.
p282_062|p282|I expect a rapid response.
p282_076|p282|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p282_089|p282|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p282_248|p282|That could be in place by next year.
p282_260|p282|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p282_274|p282|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p282_328|p282|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p282_314|p282|It will work.
p282_300|p282|This is a war over our home.
p282_102|p282|They make a selective perception process.
p282_103|p282|Two of the team became ill.
p282_117|p282|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p282_301|p282|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p282_315|p282|I came into this world with nothing.
p282_329|p282|Two people were interviewed.
p282_275|p282|It's so awful.
p282_261|p282|He has not created a Festival resource.
p282_249|p282|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p282_088|p282|They lived for their children.
p282_077|p282|It is a job creation scheme.
p282_063|p282|It happened so quickly.
p282_049|p282|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p282_075|p282|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p282_061|p282|It is unique.
p282_277|p282|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p282_263|p282|He was also married with two children.
p282_288|p282|I was the sheep.
p282_303|p282|You should be.
p282_317|p282|Our message was inclusive.
p282_129|p282|It is not a U-turn.
p282_101|p282|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p282_115|p282|It was the eighties.
p282_114|p282|It's a shame.
p282_100|p282|It is a love affair.
p282_128|p282|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p282_316|p282|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p282_302|p282|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p282_289|p282|I was brought up in a mining background.
p282_262|p282|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p282_276|p282|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p282_060|p282|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p282_074|p282|It could take some time.
p282_048|p282|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p276_078|p276|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p276_093|p276|Funding needs to be long term.
p276_087|p276|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
p276_252|p276|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p276_291|p276|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p276_285|p276|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p276_440|p276|I got a yellow card.
p276_326|p276|Is our children learning?
p276_332|p276|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p276_454|p276|They must play for each other.
p276_124|p276|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p276_130|p276|Potions said he would drive.
p276_118|p276|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p276_119|p276|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p276_131|p276|Diversions were put in place.
p276_125|p276|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p276_333|p276|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p276_455|p276|We are aiming for early March.
p276_441|p276|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p276_327|p276|How independent is that?
p276_284|p276|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p276_290|p276|We have a budget in March.
p276_247|p276|That group reported just before Christmas.
p276_253|p276|For business, the benefits will be enormous.
p276_086|p276|But the organisers refused to worry.
p276_092|p276|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p276_079|p276|I have made that offer.
p276_045|p276|And they had a case.
p276_051|p276|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
p276_047|p276|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p276_053|p276|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p276_084|p276|The new deal will now be put to the officers.
p276_090|p276|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p276_245|p276|We were right to be afraid.
p276_251|p276|That view has not altered.
p276_279|p276|This is absolutely not true.
p276_286|p276|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p276_292|p276|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p276_457|p276|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p276_331|p276|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p276_325|p276|Do you think we are a top nation?
p276_443|p276|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
p276_319|p276|I'm interested in interesting work.
p276_133|p276|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p276_127|p276|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p276_126|p276|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p276_132|p276|The Queen Mother is dead.
p276_318|p276|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p276_324|p276|Did it work?
p276_442|p276|Not many people like to do that.
p276_456|p276|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p276_330|p276|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p276_293|p276|That would open the gates of hell.
p276_287|p276|It's never great to finish second.
p276_278|p276|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p276_250|p276|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
p276_244|p276|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p276_091|p276|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p276_085|p276|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p276_052|p276|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p276_046|p276|We believe a third party was involved.
p276_042|p276|He is married with three children.
p276_056|p276|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p276_081|p276|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p276_095|p276|He's not getting into any games.
p276_268|p276|We will turn the corner.
p276_240|p276|Is it worth it?
p276_254|p276|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p276_283|p276|I've come here for the jersey.
p276_297|p276|We have to keep our clients.
p276_308|p276|Says the Duke of York.
p276_334|p276|I was inspired by two things.
p276_452|p276|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p276_446|p276|He was due to retire in December.
p276_320|p276|We represent a wide range of society.
p276_136|p276|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p276_122|p276|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p276_123|p276|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p276_137|p276|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p276_447|p276|We go there with confidence.
p276_321|p276|It caused a lot of upset.
p276_335|p276|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
p276_453|p276|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p276_309|p276|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p276_296|p276|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p276_282|p276|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
p276_255|p276|Five years later, the deception continued.
p276_241|p276|Does it matter?
p276_269|p276|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p276_094|p276|We should all be grateful.
p276_080|p276|Why do it otherwise?
p276_057|p276|Among them are many criminals.
p276_043|p276|I might well have done so already.
p276_069|p276|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p276_055|p276|This represents a tough game for us.
p276_041|p276|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p276_096|p276|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
p276_082|p276|So, did she meet him?
p276_257|p276|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p276_243|p276|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p276_294|p276|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p276_280|p276|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p276_323|p276|Does that put pressure on us?
p276_445|p276|We accept the new rules.
p276_451|p276|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
p276_337|p276|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p276_109|p276|Even the one she loved.
p276_121|p276|I am not very pleased.
p276_135|p276|Margins are also in retreat.
p276_134|p276|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p276_120|p276|Choice is a good thing.
p276_108|p276|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
p276_450|p276|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p276_336|p276|MOVIE stars are public property.
p276_322|p276|I saw them last week.
p276_444|p276|I might also completely change the routine.
p276_281|p276|They should stop the bombing.
p276_295|p276|We've made a couple of albums.
p276_242|p276|How do you take them away?
p276_256|p276|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p276_083|p276|So what is the campaign about?
p276_097|p276|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p276_040|p276|I can feel the sound inside.
p276_054|p276|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p276_068|p276|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p276_033|p276|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p276_027|p276|So is that it, then?
p276_231|p276|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p276_225|p276|You are a gambling man.
p276_219|p276|What are you not good at?
p276_345|p276|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
p276_423|p276|You didn't need to pay.
p276_437|p276|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p276_351|p276|It was worth a photograph.
p276_379|p276|Laura is an investment banker.
p276_386|p276|It must be tough to live with.
p276_392|p276|They would have to go to the Royal.
p276_147|p276|We just have to adapt.
p276_153|p276|And they all have a vote.
p276_184|p276|I've no idea how it works.
p276_190|p276|As if that is an achievement.
p276_191|p276|That will be the sweetness.
p276_185|p276|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p276_152|p276|Why change it?
p276_146|p276|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p276_393|p276|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p276_387|p276|The statement contained no surprises.
p276_378|p276|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p276_436|p276|They make the right decisions.
p276_350|p276|I won't make an official complaint.
p276_344|p276|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p276_422|p276|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p276_218|p276|how do you get it back?
p276_224|p276|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p276_230|p276|The refund is fully justified.
p276_026|p276|How are you, sir?
p276_032|p276|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p276_024|p276|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p276_030|p276|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p276_018|p276|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p276_226|p276|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p276_232|p276|I never wanted a legal battle.
p276_352|p276|I grew up with that in the amateur game.
p276_434|p276|The company declined to comment.
p276_420|p276|I have received no explanation.
p276_346|p276|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p276_408|p276|It has to be enforced.
p276_391|p276|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p276_385|p276|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p276_150|p276|Are you going to win?
p276_144|p276|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p276_178|p276|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p276_193|p276|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p276_187|p276|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p276_186|p276|The festivals will be about having fun.
p276_192|p276|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p276_179|p276|You had better believe it.
p276_145|p276|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p276_151|p276|Was it the wife?
p276_384|p276|But the rally was short-lived.
p276_390|p276|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p276_409|p276|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p276_421|p276|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p276_347|p276|You just have to give yourself a chance.
p276_353|p276|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p276_435|p276|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p276_233|p276|It would make a lot of sense.
p276_227|p276|My daughter is an adult.
p276_019|p276|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p276_031|p276|Smoking is also very important.
p276_025|p276|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p276_009|p276|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p276_021|p276|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p276_035|p276|There was a rush of water.
p276_223|p276|It's been a humbling year.
p276_237|p276|She died at her home.
p276_419|p276|Everything has its place and purpose.
p276_431|p276|We have no information on Iraq.
p276_357|p276|What are they for?
p276_343|p276|And we have the experience.
p276_425|p276|But nothing could be done.
p276_394|p276|He ended up a headmaster.
p276_380|p276|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p276_169|p276|His job was not advertised.
p276_155|p276|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p276_141|p276|Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
p276_196|p276|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p276_182|p276|There's still plenty time left.
p276_183|p276|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p276_197|p276|The feedback from them has been fantastic.
p276_140|p276|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p276_154|p276|But they must believe in themselves.
p276_168|p276|City sentiment is in his favour.
p276_381|p276|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p276_395|p276|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p276_342|p276|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p276_424|p276|The might be rolled out.
p276_430|p276|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p276_356|p276|There is no quick fix.
p276_418|p276|A, The media has been great.
p276_236|p276|Bottling is now the core business.
p276_222|p276|I learned that only yesterday.
p276_034|p276|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
p276_020|p276|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p276_008|p276|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p276_036|p276|A fiver and I'll tell.
p276_022|p276|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p276_208|p276|My father died in childbirth.
p276_234|p276|It was started almost by accident.
p276_220|p276|I think, therefore I am?
p276_368|p276|I had relied on him.
p276_426|p276|They made such decisions in London.
p276_340|p276|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p276_354|p276|They make a selective perception process.
p276_432|p276|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p276_383|p276|We played them off the pitch.
p276_397|p276|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p276_142|p276|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p276_156|p276|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
p276_181|p276|I can see it now.
p276_195|p276|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p276_194|p276|There was a fossil on screen.
p276_180|p276|It was a sobering experience.
p276_157|p276|We made a world record together.
p276_143|p276|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p276_396|p276|He is obviously very dangerous.
p276_382|p276|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p276_355|p276|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
p276_433|p276|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p276_427|p276|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p276_341|p276|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p276_369|p276|Truth is the child of time.
p276_221|p276|You've got to be vigilant.
p276_235|p276|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p276_209|p276|It is quite a thing to watch.
p276_023|p276|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p276_037|p276|We speak about the performance.
p276_012|p276|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p276_006|p276|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p276_210|p276|This should begin in October.
p276_204|p276|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p276_238|p276|Had this been common practice?
p276_364|p276|He worked there for six months.
p276_402|p276|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p276_416|p276|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p276_370|p276|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
p276_358|p276|Is there a waiting list?
p276_166|p276|It is a good lifestyle.
p276_172|p276|He was just like a godfather to it.
p276_199|p276|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
p276_198|p276|That admission is not surprising.
p276_173|p276|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p276_167|p276|Before the game we went for a pint.
p276_359|p276|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p276_417|p276|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p276_365|p276|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p276_403|p276|After the match, do you?
p276_239|p276|What do they want us to do?
p276_205|p276|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p276_211|p276|Twaddle is a case in point.
p276_007|p276|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p276_013|p276|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p276_005|p276|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p276_011|p276|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p276_039|p276|Further management changes are planned.
p276_207|p276|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p276_213|p276|Some promoters made insulting offers.
p276_373|p276|Brown has always protested his innocence.
p276_415|p276|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p276_401|p276|It had so much to do with output.
p276_367|p276|From there, they can go anywhere.
p276_429|p276|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p276_398|p276|That remains the unanswered question.
p276_171|p276|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p276_165|p276|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p276_159|p276|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p276_158|p276|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p276_164|p276|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p276_170|p276|Nato has left them with no other option.
p276_399|p276|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p276_428|p276|It seems a waste of talents.
p276_400|p276|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p276_366|p276|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p276_372|p276|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p276_414|p276|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p276_212|p276|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p276_206|p276|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p276_038|p276|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p276_010|p276|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p276_004|p276|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p276_028|p276|Do I have a favourite?
p276_014|p276|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p276_202|p276|That was just one night.
p276_216|p276|What do we want to do that for?
p276_438|p276|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p276_410|p276|Those overseas offices were great.
p276_376|p276|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p276_362|p276|Walker plans to return indoors.
p276_404|p276|Has the conflict started?
p276_389|p276|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p276_148|p276|Are you from the rugby?
p276_174|p276|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p276_160|p276|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p276_161|p276|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p276_175|p276|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
p276_149|p276|What happened in that game?
p276_388|p276|Six other people were injured.
p276_363|p276|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p276_405|p276|Have I really come to this?
p276_411|p276|You will have seen the adverts.
p276_377|p276|Instead, he missed the lot.
p276_439|p276|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
p276_217|p276|Does the name matter?
p276_203|p276|This is a frightening development.
p276_015|p276|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p276_029|p276|What do we do?
p276_017|p276|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p276_003|p276|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p276_229|p276|There was a fine line to tread.
p276_215|p276|The squad is too small.
p276_201|p276|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p276_349|p276|You have caught a serial killer.
p276_407|p276|Its failure is no surprise.
p276_361|p276|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p276_375|p276|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p276_413|p276|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p276_163|p276|That's what happened against Ayr.
p276_177|p276|They exist in name alone.
p276_188|p276|She is in good spirits.
p276_189|p276|The changes took effect from June.
p276_176|p276|It took five months to repair the damage.
p276_162|p276|A good actor doesn't think.
p276_374|p276|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p276_412|p276|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p276_406|p276|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p276_360|p276|So what happens next?
p276_348|p276|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p276_200|p276|However, the problem is the timing.
p276_214|p276|We did what we had to do.
p276_228|p276|I would not say that.
p276_002|p276|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p276_016|p276|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p276_071|p276|Let's not be too despondent.
p276_065|p276|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p276_059|p276|He is too weak to move.
p276_273|p276|What was the matter for concern?
p276_267|p276|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p276_298|p276|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p276_461|p276|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p276_307|p276|I am astonished at attack.
p276_313|p276|We've had great things in the past.
p276_449|p276|He was released after treatment.
p276_105|p276|There could be a way back.
p276_111|p276|He's been active in Arabia.
p276_139|p276|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p276_138|p276|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p276_110|p276|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p276_104|p276|Context is also very important.
p276_448|p276|They are interior designers and architects.
p276_312|p276|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p276_460|p276|We will pay their bills.
p276_306|p276|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p276_299|p276|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p276_266|p276|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p276_272|p276|was everything done to save people?
p276_058|p276|And they removed a Borderer.
p276_064|p276|He looks like an Afghan.
p276_070|p276|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p276_066|p276|He will need that machine.
p276_072|p276|There was no safety net.
p276_099|p276|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p276_264|p276|The family kept away from me.
p276_270|p276|My Dad is a hero.
p276_258|p276|I felt we deserved the three points.
p276_310|p276|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p276_304|p276|Each case is treated on merit.
p276_462|p276|It was very positive and very helpful.
p276_338|p276|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p276_112|p276|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p276_106|p276|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p276_107|p276|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p276_113|p276|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p276_339|p276|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p276_305|p276|A winter of discontent awaits.
p276_463|p276|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p276_311|p276|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p276_259|p276|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p276_271|p276|And they were being paid?
p276_265|p276|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p276_098|p276|It was exactly four months away.
p276_073|p276|The Government does not go far enough.
p276_067|p276|Then they scored two goals to win.
p276_063|p276|We like being the underdogs.
p276_077|p276|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p276_088|p276|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p276_249|p276|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p276_261|p276|Mr Blair had done well.
p276_275|p276|Is it in the right place?
p276_329|p276|Are they free?
p276_315|p276|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p276_301|p276|This championship is different from the other majors.
p276_117|p276|Those people must be accountable.
p276_103|p276|It wasn't possible to relax.
p276_102|p276|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p276_116|p276|I've had it for the exams.
p276_300|p276|Everything else is a bonus.
p276_314|p276|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p276_328|p276|What form did that take?
p276_274|p276|Do I think about them often?
p276_260|p276|They've got some extremely good players.
p276_248|p276|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p276_089|p276|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p276_076|p276|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p276_062|p276|Everything is possible in football.
p276_048|p276|It carried a double message.
p276_074|p276|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p276_060|p276|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p276_276|p276|Did he trip?
p276_262|p276|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p276_289|p276|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p276_458|p276|It will take place in July.
p276_302|p276|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p276_464|p276|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p276_316|p276|It has been recorded twice.
p276_128|p276|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p276_100|p276|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p276_114|p276|It is sometimes like that.
p276_115|p276|He was unprepared for this fight.
p276_101|p276|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p276_129|p276|They lived for their children.
p276_317|p276|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p276_303|p276|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p276_465|p276|We are having a look.
p276_459|p276|There's not much money in cycling.
p276_288|p276|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
p276_263|p276|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p276_277|p276|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p276_061|p276|They desperately want some stability.
p276_075|p276|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p276_049|p276|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p249_131|p249|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p249_125|p249|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p249_079|p249|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p249_045|p249|Is a drug dealer?
p249_051|p249|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p249_086|p249|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p249_092|p249|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p249_247|p249|There wasn't a goal.
p249_253|p249|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p249_284|p249|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p249_290|p249|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p249_291|p249|These figures are truly awful.
p249_285|p249|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p249_252|p249|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p249_246|p249|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p249_093|p249|And rugby fans can help.
p249_087|p249|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p249_050|p249|He looks like an Afghan.
p249_044|p249|It's a blessing.
p249_078|p249|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p249_124|p249|Who would have?
p249_130|p249|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
p249_118|p249|They were behind the wheel.
p249_326|p249|It could have gone either way.
p249_332|p249|Who will do it?
p249_318|p249|The problems began a long time ago.
p249_324|p249|I am so upset.
p249_330|p249|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p249_126|p249|You can spend money on housing.
p249_132|p249|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p249_052|p249|It will come all right.
p249_046|p249|As she explains.
p249_278|p249|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p249_244|p249|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p249_293|p249|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p249_287|p249|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p249_286|p249|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p249_292|p249|He should have won.
p249_245|p249|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p249_251|p249|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p249_279|p249|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p249_084|p249|I've not thought about it.
p249_090|p249|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p249_047|p249|He is too weak to move.
p249_053|p249|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p249_133|p249|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p249_127|p249|There were no grounds for his action.
p249_331|p249|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p249_319|p249|Referees are easy targets.
p249_321|p249|I came into this world with nothing.
p249_335|p249|I must make that clear.
p249_309|p249|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p249_123|p249|They've got to account for it.
p249_137|p249|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p249_057|p249|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p249_043|p249|The boy is no longer with us.
p249_094|p249|They lived for their children.
p249_080|p249|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p249_255|p249|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p249_241|p249|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p249_269|p249|And Michael was just great.
p249_296|p249|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p249_282|p249|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p249_283|p249|You've got to have both sides.
p249_297|p249|What has altered?
p249_268|p249|It is the same in Sweden.
p249_240|p249|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p249_254|p249|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p249_081|p249|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p249_095|p249|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p249_042|p249|It's a crucial award.
p249_056|p249|It's very odd.
p249_136|p249|What will happen then?
p249_122|p249|Does this mean.
p249_308|p249|And he goes with it.
p249_320|p249|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p249_336|p249|The train was on time.
p249_322|p249|That's the law of the land.
p249_134|p249|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p249_120|p249|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p249_108|p249|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p249_040|p249|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p249_054|p249|Next league matches Celtic.
p249_068|p249|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p249_083|p249|Even the one she loved.
p249_097|p249|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p249_256|p249|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p249_281|p249|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p249_295|p249|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p249_294|p249|A new school will be built.
p249_280|p249|There's nothing I can say.
p249_257|p249|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p249_243|p249|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p249_096|p249|Now the system is right behind us.
p249_082|p249|It is a job creation scheme.
p249_069|p249|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p249_055|p249|It happens from time to time.
p249_041|p249|Sure, it's funny.
p249_109|p249|It is a good day for the coalition.
p249_121|p249|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p249_135|p249|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p249_323|p249|There was no time scale.
p249_337|p249|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p249_350|p249|It is horrible.
p249_344|p249|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p249_152|p249|It is not just about pay.
p249_146|p249|Is that Titanic?
p249_191|p249|It is not fair.
p249_185|p249|It is not either national standards or local control.
p249_026|p249|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p249_032|p249|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p249_218|p249|But I am a worried man.
p249_224|p249|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p249_230|p249|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p249_231|p249|It is a gamble.
p249_225|p249|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p249_219|p249|There was an e-mail.
p249_033|p249|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p249_027|p249|It's nice to hear.
p249_184|p249|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p249_190|p249|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p249_147|p249|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p249_153|p249|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p249_345|p249|Eight months later, he was dead.
p249_351|p249|It was very formal.
p249_347|p249|It's all going to clear the debt.
p249_353|p249|I kept going for her.
p249_179|p249|Someone who cares
p249_145|p249|It is difficult for Ali.
p249_186|p249|It should be easy.
p249_192|p249|Miller was every bit as happy.
p249_019|p249|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p249_031|p249|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p249_025|p249|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p249_226|p249|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p249_232|p249|My neighbours are horrified.
p249_024|p249|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p249_030|p249|There's a story, too.
p249_018|p249|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p249_193|p249|We want to help them through it.
p249_187|p249|Everyone can be bought.
p249_150|p249|It is like a football team.
p249_144|p249|He is severe.
p249_178|p249|The release attracted little attention.
p249_352|p249|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p249_342|p249|He's a genius.
p249_140|p249|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p249_154|p249|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p249_168|p249|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p249_183|p249|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p249_197|p249|It is tough, but possible.
p249_034|p249|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p249_020|p249|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p249_008|p249|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p249_236|p249|Broke the birdie record.
p249_222|p249|Twaddle is a case in point.
p249_223|p249|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p249_237|p249|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p249_009|p249|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p249_021|p249|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p249_035|p249|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p249_196|p249|I had a train to catch.
p249_182|p249|The jury is still out.
p249_169|p249|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
p249_155|p249|The weaknesses are few.
p249_141|p249|It's a question of fashion.
p249_343|p249|They should take their mobile phones.
p249_341|p249|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p249_157|p249|It is not normal practice.
p249_143|p249|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p249_194|p249|I put the drawing down.
p249_180|p249|I always felt they played for me.
p249_023|p249|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p249_037|p249|It is not for any other purpose.
p249_221|p249|We'll have to work hard today.
p249_235|p249|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p249_209|p249|I have a cold.
p249_208|p249|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
p249_234|p249|He is in the queue.
p249_220|p249|Feel the heat?
p249_036|p249|It was clear.
p249_022|p249|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p249_181|p249|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p249_142|p249|We need to chat.
p249_156|p249|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p249_340|p249|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p249_354|p249|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p249_173|p249|It is not too late to get on board.
p249_167|p249|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p249_198|p249|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p249_007|p249|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p249_013|p249|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p249_239|p249|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p249_205|p249|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p249_211|p249|Ferguson should take note.
p249_210|p249|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p249_204|p249|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
p249_238|p249|We were a load of rubbish.
p249_012|p249|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p249_006|p249|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p249_199|p249|However, this idea is never developed.
p249_166|p249|It is an attitude of mind.
p249_172|p249|Tell it like it was?
p249_164|p249|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p249_170|p249|I'm so worried about the roads.
p249_038|p249|He did not know his daughter.
p249_010|p249|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p249_004|p249|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p249_212|p249|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p249_206|p249|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p249_207|p249|The service from the other players was super.
p249_213|p249|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p249_005|p249|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p249_011|p249|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p249_039|p249|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p249_171|p249|We have to move forward.
p249_165|p249|These days are long gone.
p249_159|p249|It was by the numbers.
p249_161|p249|There's a pause.
p249_149|p249|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p249_029|p249|Because we do not need it.
p249_217|p249|This is a good move for me.
p249_203|p249|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p249_202|p249|It is a case of taking a risk.
p249_216|p249|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p249_028|p249|They should be so lucky.
p249_014|p249|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p249_148|p249|The idea is simple.
p249_174|p249|We have a budget in March.
p249_160|p249|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p249_348|p249|He had played well in that central role.
p249_176|p249|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p249_162|p249|Neither side can win this war.
p249_189|p249|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p249_002|p249|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p249_016|p249|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p249_200|p249|Last night was a key episode.
p249_214|p249|It's all about money, money, money.
p249_229|p249|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p249_201|p249|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p249_017|p249|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p249_003|p249|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p249_188|p249|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p249_163|p249|They should stop the bombing.
p249_177|p249|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p249_349|p249|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p249_312|p249|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p249_306|p249|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p249_138|p249|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p249_110|p249|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p249_104|p249|Then came the crunch.
p249_058|p249|It is unique.
p249_064|p249|And a film maker was born.
p249_070|p249|Have a look at our accounts.
p249_266|p249|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p249_272|p249|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p249_299|p249|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p249_298|p249|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p249_273|p249|Things can change.
p249_267|p249|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p249_071|p249|It is like a river running by my home.
p249_065|p249|You did not change overnight.
p249_059|p249|It will take time.
p249_105|p249|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p249_111|p249|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p249_139|p249|It was very frightened and dirty.
p249_307|p249|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p249_313|p249|Is there on his hands?
p249_339|p249|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p249_305|p249|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p249_311|p249|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p249_107|p249|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p249_113|p249|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p249_073|p249|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p249_067|p249|Scotland had great assets.
p249_098|p249|Today I couldn't run on it.
p249_259|p249|His contract was then not renewed.
p249_271|p249|It's not even finished.
p249_265|p249|He has not created a Festival resource.
p249_270|p249|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p249_258|p249|They must play for each other.
p249_099|p249|However, it did not end that way.
p249_066|p249|There was a battle there.
p249_072|p249|Try to save us.
p249_112|p249|It is a good lifestyle.
p249_106|p249|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p249_310|p249|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p249_304|p249|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p249_338|p249|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p249_300|p249|Our task is to complete the picture.
p249_314|p249|Special measures were needed.
p249_328|p249|My view has now completely changed.
p249_102|p249|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p249_116|p249|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p249_076|p249|The play is based on a real-life event.
p249_062|p249|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p249_089|p249|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p249_274|p249|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p249_260|p249|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p249_248|p249|I was shocked.
p249_249|p249|I should think so, too.
p249_261|p249|That's the only thing I will say.
p249_275|p249|People have no choice.
p249_088|p249|She had kept the news from him.
p249_063|p249|I'm just enjoying every match.
p249_077|p249|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p249_117|p249|It's a long process.
p249_103|p249|Until you hit the big games.
p249_329|p249|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p249_315|p249|They were fantastic.
p249_301|p249|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p249_317|p249|They wanted the club to make money.
p249_303|p249|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p249_115|p249|You had better believe it.
p249_101|p249|It is an old family habit.
p249_129|p249|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p249_061|p249|Jobs could go.
p249_075|p249|Painful, but only because it's true.
p249_049|p249|I would love to have him home.
p249_263|p249|They are never here.
p249_277|p249|He has a wealth of experience.
p249_288|p249|Scotland were beaten again.
p249_289|p249|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p249_276|p249|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p249_262|p249|Blood samples were taken.
p249_048|p249|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p249_074|p249|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p249_060|p249|That's the truth.
p249_128|p249|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p249_100|p249|We must look forward.
p249_114|p249|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p249_302|p249|They are wrong.
p249_316|p249|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p254_304|p254|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p254_112|p254|That all hope is never lost.
p254_106|p254|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p254_066|p254|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p254_072|p254|Four other charges were dropped.
p254_099|p254|And rugby fans can help.
p254_258|p254|The pensioners did not want to know.
p254_264|p254|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p254_270|p254|It was an easy decision to come here.
p254_271|p254|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p254_265|p254|There is no link.
p254_259|p254|It is also very valuable.
p254_098|p254|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p254_073|p254|They're appalled by that.
p254_067|p254|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p254_107|p254|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p254_113|p254|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
p254_305|p254|They were fantastic.
p254_311|p254|He said she was mad.
p254_339|p254|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p254_307|p254|Craig is a major concern for us.
p254_313|p254|We are in the end game.
p254_139|p254|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p254_105|p254|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p254_111|p254|It was an adventure.
p254_059|p254|Life is good.
p254_071|p254|Jobs could go.
p254_065|p254|That's the day job.
p254_273|p254|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p254_267|p254|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p254_298|p254|One was a lawyer.
p254_299|p254|It is a road of death.
p254_266|p254|This is a question of Islam.
p254_272|p254|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p254_064|p254|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p254_070|p254|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p254_058|p254|He is too weak to move.
p254_110|p254|He takes the job.
p254_104|p254|I love the Dome.
p254_138|p254|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p254_312|p254|In the old days, it was easy.
p254_306|p254|We are a peaceful people.
p254_302|p254|I did not name it.
p254_316|p254|The parents will have a great time, too.
p254_100|p254|Now the system is right behind us.
p254_114|p254|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p254_128|p254|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p254_074|p254|There was a battle there.
p254_060|p254|It is the whole package.
p254_048|p254|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p254_276|p254|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p254_262|p254|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p254_289|p254|The mood is good.
p254_288|p254|He will address the nation this evening.
p254_263|p254|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p254_277|p254|It's a way of life.
p254_049|p254|This represents a tough game for us.
p254_061|p254|This is a club on the rise.
p254_075|p254|It's good news and long overdue.
p254_129|p254|It is a job creation scheme.
p254_115|p254|It is normal.
p254_101|p254|However, it did not end that way.
p254_317|p254|Donald was his friend.
p254_303|p254|We have waited a long time for this.
p254_315|p254|It is a strong case.
p254_301|p254|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p254_329|p254|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p254_117|p254|We need to handle it.
p254_103|p254|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
p254_063|p254|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p254_077|p254|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p254_088|p254|Even the one she loved.
p254_261|p254|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p254_275|p254|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p254_249|p254|He's a lovely young man.
p254_248|p254|I was shocked.
p254_260|p254|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p254_076|p254|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_062|p254|He had no enemies.
p254_102|p254|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p254_116|p254|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p254_300|p254|The plot is minimal.
p254_314|p254|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p254_373|p254|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p254_367|p254|They received a reply from their own managers.
p254_401|p254|It really is a gift to the world.
p254_398|p254|Eriksson would have approved.
p254_159|p254|This latter point is hugely important.
p254_171|p254|He was a crazy man.
p254_165|p254|I have got a wife to feed.
p254_039|p254|They're just different.
p254_005|p254|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p254_011|p254|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p254_207|p254|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p254_213|p254|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p254_212|p254|The FBI could become involved.
p254_206|p254|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
p254_010|p254|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p254_004|p254|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p254_038|p254|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p254_164|p254|They are not advertised.
p254_170|p254|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p254_158|p254|We will turn the corner.
p254_399|p254|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p254_366|p254|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p254_400|p254|It was a breathtaking moment.
p254_372|p254|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p254_358|p254|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p254_402|p254|The car was just there.
p254_364|p254|It's now down in black and white.
p254_370|p254|Talks are progressing.
p254_166|p254|Tell it like it was?
p254_172|p254|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p254_199|p254|Today was first class.
p254_012|p254|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p254_006|p254|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p254_238|p254|But it's a subtle process.
p254_210|p254|His third goal was superb.
p254_204|p254|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p254_205|p254|That is an important part of our role.
p254_211|p254|It's not ideal.
p254_239|p254|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p254_007|p254|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p254_013|p254|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p254_198|p254|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p254_173|p254|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p254_167|p254|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p254_371|p254|They play together perfectly.
p254_403|p254|It was on fire.
p254_365|p254|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p254_359|p254|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p254_361|p254|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p254_375|p254|It is a large number.
p254_349|p254|It was very formal.
p254_163|p254|It has to be now.
p254_177|p254|The clarity is vital.
p254_188|p254|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p254_017|p254|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p254_003|p254|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p254_215|p254|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p254_201|p254|We have an election in eight days.
p254_229|p254|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p254_228|p254|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p254_200|p254|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p254_214|p254|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p254_002|p254|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p254_016|p254|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p254_189|p254|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p254_176|p254|It is not either national standards or local control.
p254_162|p254|He's a nice guy.
p254_348|p254|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p254_374|p254|It became a national network.
p254_360|p254|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p254_376|p254|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p254_362|p254|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p254_389|p254|At the last I found a bunker.
p254_174|p254|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p254_160|p254|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p254_148|p254|There is a lack of chemistry.
p254_014|p254|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p254_028|p254|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p254_202|p254|It's like a garage.
p254_216|p254|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p254_217|p254|You have to do your research.
p254_203|p254|But I am a worried man.
p254_029|p254|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p254_015|p254|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p254_001|p254|Please call Stella.  
p254_149|p254|This is the way things should be handled.
p254_161|p254|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p254_175|p254|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p254_388|p254|They really did a great job.
p254_363|p254|There was no option.
p254_377|p254|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p254_352|p254|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p254_346|p254|It's all going to clear the debt.
p254_391|p254|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
p254_385|p254|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p254_178|p254|The hotel was now for sale.
p254_150|p254|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p254_144|p254|Three penalties were given.
p254_193|p254|The conference is the first test.
p254_187|p254|Peace was won.
p254_018|p254|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p254_024|p254|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p254_030|p254|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p254_226|p254|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p254_232|p254|We were a load of rubbish.
p254_233|p254|They should come forward.
p254_227|p254|At the time, he was a living legend.
p254_031|p254|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p254_025|p254|Johnson was pretty low.
p254_019|p254|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p254_186|p254|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p254_192|p254|Is that it?
p254_145|p254|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p254_151|p254|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p254_179|p254|Tony had arrived.
p254_384|p254|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
p254_390|p254|Yet the data is compelling.
p254_347|p254|That is a break with tradition.
p254_353|p254|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p254_379|p254|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p254_345|p254|Tell us about it.
p254_351|p254|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p254_386|p254|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p254_392|p254|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
p254_147|p254|It is difficult for Ali.
p254_153|p254|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p254_184|p254|However, this idea is never developed.
p254_190|p254|Off I went.
p254_033|p254|It's a matter of balance.
p254_027|p254|They may be wrong.
p254_219|p254|We played them off the pitch.
p254_231|p254|And thought we would get away with it.
p254_225|p254|It's so special.
p254_224|p254|They are the innocent victims.
p254_230|p254|They tried to give her advice.
p254_218|p254|Saturday is gone.
p254_026|p254|But it failed.
p254_032|p254|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p254_191|p254|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p254_185|p254|I grew up listening to these people.
p254_152|p254|It is not just about pay.
p254_146|p254|He is severe.
p254_393|p254|I'm pleased about one thing.
p254_387|p254|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p254_350|p254|I kept going for her.
p254_344|p254|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p254_378|p254|He has the edge.
p254_340|p254|They should take their mobile phones.
p254_354|p254|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p254_383|p254|I'm just enjoying every match.
p254_397|p254|I can lead by example.
p254_156|p254|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p254_181|p254|I was totally wrong.
p254_195|p254|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p254_022|p254|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p254_234|p254|It is not the message alone.
p254_220|p254|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p254_208|p254|I began to pray.
p254_209|p254|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p254_221|p254|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p254_235|p254|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
p254_023|p254|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p254_037|p254|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p254_194|p254|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p254_180|p254|He will need that machine.
p254_157|p254|I was in daily contact.
p254_143|p254|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p254_396|p254|We're looking for justice.
p254_382|p254|I am very happy with life.
p254_369|p254|Five members were disciplined.
p254_355|p254|We will be homeless.
p254_341|p254|It is not like working for a living.
p254_357|p254|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p254_343|p254|It is long gone.
p254_394|p254|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p254_380|p254|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p254_155|p254|The weaknesses are few.
p254_141|p254|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p254_169|p254|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
p254_196|p254|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p254_182|p254|We did everything by the book.
p254_021|p254|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p254_035|p254|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p254_009|p254|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p254_223|p254|The track is currently covered in snow.
p254_237|p254|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p254_236|p254|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p254_222|p254|The boy is no longer with us.
p254_008|p254|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p254_034|p254|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p254_020|p254|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p254_183|p254|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p254_197|p254|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p254_168|p254|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p254_140|p254|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p254_154|p254|You know the type.
p254_381|p254|Face to face
p254_395|p254|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p254_342|p254|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p254_356|p254|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p254_319|p254|The police have to act to help them.
p254_331|p254|It has moved on in the last week.
p254_133|p254|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p254_127|p254|Does this mean.
p254_047|p254|I am just going to go for it.
p254_053|p254|It's a blessing.
p254_084|p254|The price cuts are really exciting.
p254_090|p254|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p254_279|p254|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p254_245|p254|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p254_251|p254|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p254_286|p254|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p254_292|p254|This is a national crisis.
p254_293|p254|Well, he can do it.
p254_287|p254|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254_250|p254|There's the mix.
p254_244|p254|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p254_278|p254|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p254_091|p254|It may well have been.
p254_085|p254|My office is bare.
p254_052|p254|That should do it.
p254_046|p254|That period was a struggle.
p254_126|p254|I joined a group.
p254_132|p254|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p254_324|p254|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p254_330|p254|They haven't got a hope.
p254_318|p254|He was not a big name.
p254_326|p254|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p254_332|p254|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p254_118|p254|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p254_124|p254|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p254_130|p254|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p254_078|p254|They never gave up hope.
p254_050|p254|It's a crucial award.
p254_044|p254|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p254_093|p254|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p254_087|p254|There was an e-mail.
p254_252|p254|This year I understood.
p254_246|p254|He got the same story.
p254_291|p254|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p254_285|p254|I saw it at a ruck.
p254_284|p254|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p254_290|p254|It's like a high school play.
p254_247|p254|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p254_253|p254|That could be in place by next year.
p254_086|p254|Is there a new way forward?
p254_092|p254|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p254_045|p254|No meaningful response was issued.
p254_051|p254|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p254_079|p254|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p254_131|p254|I'm so angry.
p254_125|p254|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p254_119|p254|It's a long process.
p254_333|p254|Today she has been released.
p254_327|p254|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p254_323|p254|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p254_337|p254|It should be scrapped.
p254_121|p254|The fire was above the hole.
p254_135|p254|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p254_109|p254|But it was a pleasure.
p254_055|p254|But it might have done.
p254_041|p254|It is not for any other purpose.
p254_069|p254|My mother is a widow.
p254_096|p254|All options are open.
p254_082|p254|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p254_257|p254|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p254_243|p254|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p254_294|p254|These figures are truly awful.
p254_280|p254|People have no choice.
p254_281|p254|If not, he should go home.
p254_295|p254|That could change.
p254_242|p254|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p254_256|p254|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p254_083|p254|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p254_097|p254|You will be.
p254_068|p254|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p254_040|p254|It was clear.
p254_054|p254|Is a drug dealer?
p254_108|p254|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p254_134|p254|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p254_120|p254|They were behind the wheel.
p254_336|p254|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p254_322|p254|It's not long enough.
p254_334|p254|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p254_320|p254|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p254_308|p254|The problems began a long time ago.
p254_136|p254|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p254_122|p254|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p254_042|p254|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p254_056|p254|That time has passed.
p254_081|p254|It's all I can do.
p254_095|p254|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p254_240|p254|My future is in the marathon.
p254_254|p254|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p254_268|p254|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p254_283|p254|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p254_297|p254|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p254_296|p254|Who can predict?
p254_282|p254|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p254_269|p254|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p254_255|p254|It's a source of deep concern.
p254_241|p254|They are all bright and different.
p254_094|p254|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p254_080|p254|Painful, but only because it's true.
p254_057|p254|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p254_043|p254|I was scared.
p254_123|p254|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p254_137|p254|It plans to return to this field.
p254_309|p254|My body is clearly capable.
p254_321|p254|The boat was fantastic.
p254_335|p254|It should be a great game, though.
p298_218|p298|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p298_032|p298|The feeling is marvellous.
p298_026|p298|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p298_185|p298|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p298_191|p298|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p298_146|p298|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p298_152|p298|Who would take it now, after all this?
p298_387|p298|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p298_393|p298|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p298_344|p298|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p298_350|p298|People tended to stay there for some time.
p298_378|p298|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p298_379|p298|I have beaten her a few times.
p298_351|p298|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p298_345|p298|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p298_392|p298|We have to offer value for money.
p298_386|p298|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p298_153|p298|I felt really good until Friday.
p298_147|p298|I always knew she was funny.
p298_190|p298|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p298_184|p298|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p298_027|p298|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p298_033|p298|I think they should have more respect.
p298_219|p298|It has made me feel good.
p298_225|p298|It did my image a lot of good!
p298_231|p298|I fell in love with ballet.
p298_227|p298|It's been a long, long journey.
p298_233|p298|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p298_025|p298|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p298_031|p298|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p298_019|p298|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p298_192|p298|I think we finished fifth.
p298_186|p298|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p298_151|p298|It is always the same, isn't it?
p298_145|p298|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p298_179|p298|One person was believed to have been hit.
p298_390|p298|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p298_384|p298|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p298_353|p298|This represents a tough game for us.
p298_347|p298|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p298_346|p298|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p298_352|p298|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p298_385|p298|This is the first stage of catching up.
p298_391|p298|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p298_178|p298|You let a lot of people down.
p298_144|p298|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p298_150|p298|It was fit for royalty.
p298_187|p298|Our people should be immune.
p298_193|p298|It was not a foul.
p298_018|p298|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p298_030|p298|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p298_024|p298|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p298_232|p298|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p298_226|p298|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p298_222|p298|She has now been registered as disabled.
p298_236|p298|We're still talking with a few people.
p298_008|p298|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p298_020|p298|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p298_034|p298|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p298_197|p298|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p298_183|p298|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p298_168|p298|Can they be serious?
p298_154|p298|That gives us something to kick against.
p298_140|p298|I played really well on the back nine.
p298_395|p298|I am just looking to God.
p298_381|p298|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p298_356|p298|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p298_342|p298|I get to work with very good people.
p298_343|p298|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p298_357|p298|I would urge the Government to think again.
p298_380|p298|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p298_394|p298|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p298_141|p298|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p298_155|p298|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p298_169|p298|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p298_182|p298|They just would not have run away.
p298_196|p298|I don't know exactly what happened.
p298_035|p298|They are interior designers and architects.
p298_021|p298|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p298_009|p298|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p298_237|p298|But one shouldn't go by that.
p298_223|p298|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p298_209|p298|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p298_235|p298|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p298_221|p298|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p298_037|p298|Others may be trying to catch up.
p298_023|p298|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p298_180|p298|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p298_194|p298|We know them as mobile telephones.
p298_143|p298|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p298_157|p298|There is precious little middle ground.
p298_382|p298|We are being hijacked.
p298_396|p298|The woman is basically off her head.
p298_369|p298|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p298_341|p298|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p298_355|p298|The boy is no longer with us.
p298_354|p298|He saw it all as a big game.
p298_340|p298|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p298_368|p298|It was also put on the Internet.
p298_397|p298|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p298_383|p298|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p298_156|p298|Equity declined to comment.
p298_142|p298|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p298_195|p298|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p298_181|p298|We aren't going to play better.
p298_022|p298|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p298_036|p298|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p298_220|p298|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p298_234|p298|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p298_208|p298|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p298_290|p298|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p298_284|p298|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p298_253|p298|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p298_247|p298|We're into that build-up now.
p298_092|p298|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p298_086|p298|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p298_051|p298|This guy is never going to give up.
p298_045|p298|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
p298_079|p298|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p298_125|p298|I asked why he had come.
p298_131|p298|He loves the big occasions.
p298_119|p298|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p298_327|p298|They will want to watch a winning team.
p298_333|p298|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p298_332|p298|I have a theory.
p298_326|p298|What is the truth about the cow?
p298_118|p298|We are losing this war.
p298_130|p298|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p298_124|p298|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p298_078|p298|We just try to make great records.
p298_044|p298|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p298_050|p298|I saw them not long after it happened.
p298_087|p298|There were no passengers on board.
p298_093|p298|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p298_246|p298|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p298_252|p298|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p298_285|p298|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p298_291|p298|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p298_287|p298|There is no smoking gun.
p298_293|p298|I felt under no pressure today.
p298_244|p298|All were later allowed home.
p298_250|p298|But first it goes out on TV.
p298_278|p298|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p298_085|p298|We really need research to help with that.
p298_091|p298|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p298_046|p298|I did not want any damage to us.
p298_052|p298|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p298_132|p298|They should take their mobile phones.
p298_126|p298|Will they ever reopen?
p298_330|p298|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p298_324|p298|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p298_318|p298|We have grown up in Britain.
p298_319|p298|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p298_325|p298|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p298_331|p298|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p298_127|p298|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p298_133|p298|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p298_053|p298|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p298_047|p298|It was an easy decision to come here.
p298_090|p298|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p298_084|p298|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p298_279|p298|I bought a car at auction.
p298_251|p298|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p298_245|p298|She has a wonderful mind.
p298_292|p298|I have been coming here for nine years.
p298_286|p298|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p298_282|p298|She had been sexually assaulted.
p298_296|p298|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p298_269|p298|After that nothing could save him.
p298_241|p298|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p298_255|p298|We have reacted well to each other.
p298_080|p298|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p298_094|p298|Scotland were beaten again.
p298_043|p298|This is purely financial.
p298_057|p298|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p298_137|p298|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p298_123|p298|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p298_309|p298|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p298_335|p298|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p298_321|p298|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p298_320|p298|I am proud of those guys.
p298_334|p298|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p298_308|p298|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p298_122|p298|I've got no secret.
p298_136|p298|It was to be published next month.
p298_056|p298|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p298_042|p298|His charisma is all on the course.
p298_095|p298|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p298_081|p298|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p298_254|p298|I learned a lot from her.
p298_240|p298|They had four children together.
p298_268|p298|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p298_297|p298|That is a job for the Government.
p298_283|p298|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p298_295|p298|And that was the adults.
p298_281|p298|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p298_256|p298|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p298_242|p298|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p298_097|p298|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p298_083|p298|His parenthood is called into question.
p298_068|p298|Some people still think she should be English.
p298_054|p298|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p298_040|p298|I let go the telephone and ran.
p298_108|p298|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p298_120|p298|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p298_134|p298|We have big ideas.
p298_322|p298|It is too early to speculate.
p298_336|p298|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p298_337|p298|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p298_323|p298|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p298_135|p298|I first met him last summer.
p298_121|p298|They will know they deserve to be there.
p298_109|p298|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p298_041|p298|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p298_055|p298|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p298_069|p298|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p298_082|p298|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p298_096|p298|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p298_243|p298|How can they engage with the work?
p298_257|p298|They seem to be backing off from that.
p298_280|p298|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p298_294|p298|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p298_299|p298|And he had much need.
p298_272|p298|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p298_266|p298|There is no such thing.
p298_070|p298|Repayment is not part of the game.
p298_064|p298|Seven children had lost both parents.
p298_058|p298|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p298_104|p298|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p298_110|p298|There was no time scale.
p298_138|p298|It could have been a hammering by now.
p298_306|p298|Some have other commitments.
p298_312|p298|We have the location, which is assured.
p298_313|p298|Rapid revision was required.
p298_307|p298|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p298_139|p298|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p298_111|p298|Only the scale of change differed.
p298_105|p298|Referees are easy targets.
p298_059|p298|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p298_065|p298|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p298_071|p298|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p298_267|p298|I feel very strongly about that.
p298_273|p298|It is now very clear that doesn't work.
p298_298|p298|I felt the head was very like me.
p298_265|p298|I've seen some of the submissions.
p298_271|p298|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p298_259|p298|Do you think you have a shot?
p298_098|p298|She is on a life support machine.
p298_067|p298|Most people know that.
p298_073|p298|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p298_113|p298|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p298_107|p298|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p298_311|p298|That was moving the goalposts.
p298_305|p298|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p298_339|p298|Some of his family still live there.
p298_338|p298|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p298_304|p298|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p298_310|p298|The crowd was awesome.
p298_106|p298|The luxury has been well used.
p298_112|p298|Tell you the team he picked?
p298_072|p298|What do they pay to join the club?
p298_066|p298|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p298_099|p298|Their vision was not impeded.
p298_258|p298|They have a very good method of working.
p298_270|p298|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p298_264|p298|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p298_248|p298|It is the end of an era.
p298_260|p298|I believe we have a good chance.
p298_274|p298|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p298_089|p298|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p298_062|p298|Don't say you have not been warned.
p298_076|p298|It will be very useful for us.
p298_116|p298|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p298_102|p298|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p298_328|p298|Who is going to be penalised?
p298_314|p298|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p298_300|p298|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p298_301|p298|This can only help us go forward.
p298_315|p298|We couldn't go very fast.
p298_329|p298|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p298_103|p298|He went to see what he could learn.
p298_117|p298|And it's more subversive.
p298_077|p298|He was obviously very genuine.
p298_063|p298|That is a mark of what you are.
p298_088|p298|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p298_275|p298|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p298_261|p298|Things were not easy from the outset.
p298_249|p298|We can just get on with our game.
p298_288|p298|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p298_277|p298|Last year, however, was a different story.
p298_263|p298|We've had great things in the past.
p298_049|p298|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p298_075|p298|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p298_061|p298|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p298_129|p298|We have great team spirit.
p298_101|p298|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p298_115|p298|I'd like to take the plunge.
p298_303|p298|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p298_317|p298|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p298_316|p298|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p298_302|p298|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p298_114|p298|The cold war is over.
p298_100|p298|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p298_128|p298|A lot of people were in tears.
p298_060|p298|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p298_074|p298|We are now in a safe place.
p298_048|p298|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p298_262|p298|She may even appear in some more films.
p298_276|p298|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p298_289|p298|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p298_211|p298|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p298_205|p298|I'm going with all three.
p298_239|p298|I think in three dimensions.
p298_013|p298|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p298_007|p298|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p298_198|p298|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p298_167|p298|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p298_173|p298|We are all family men with children.
p298_403|p298|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p298_365|p298|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p298_371|p298|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p298_359|p298|I was happiest with my short game.
p298_358|p298|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p298_370|p298|Now that was a boxing movie.
p298_402|p298|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p298_364|p298|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p298_172|p298|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p298_166|p298|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p298_199|p298|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p298_006|p298|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p298_012|p298|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p298_238|p298|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p298_204|p298|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p298_210|p298|He had taken everything from me.
p298_206|p298|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p298_212|p298|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p298_004|p298|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p298_010|p298|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p298_038|p298|It was a crucial moment.
p298_170|p298|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p298_164|p298|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p298_158|p298|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p298_399|p298|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p298_372|p298|There was a battle there.
p298_366|p298|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p298_400|p298|The South African defended his work ethic.
p298_367|p298|And a film maker was born.
p298_401|p298|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p298_373|p298|I might also completely change the routine.
p298_398|p298|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p298_159|p298|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p298_165|p298|It is quite an eye opener.
p298_171|p298|It's just that we see different things.
p298_039|p298|We gave everything we had.
p298_011|p298|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p298_005|p298|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p298_213|p298|They should also have the right to vote.
p298_207|p298|The line-up is a tasty one.
p298_203|p298|You can be sure we will have problems.
p298_217|p298|They had given up on him.
p298_029|p298|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p298_001|p298|Please call Stella.
p298_015|p298|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p298_149|p298|I expected these kind of questions.
p298_175|p298|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p298_161|p298|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p298_388|p298|The damage from the fire was huge.
p298_377|p298|I have learned a lot from him.
p298_405|p298|He showed he has some things to learn.
p298_363|p298|Would he be able to live with that?
p298_404|p298|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p298_362|p298|As if he were a High Court judge.
p298_376|p298|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p298_389|p298|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p298_160|p298|They were both delightful to work with.
p298_174|p298|I think we showed that after half time.
p298_148|p298|All kinds of things occur.
p298_014|p298|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p298_028|p298|That is just a load of baloney.
p298_216|p298|People are so negative about the whole business.
p298_202|p298|I am not a happy man.
p298_228|p298|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p298_214|p298|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p298_200|p298|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p298_016|p298|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p298_002|p298|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p298_189|p298|It is simple and easy to use.
p298_162|p298|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p298_176|p298|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p298_348|p298|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p298_360|p298|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p298_374|p298|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p298_375|p298|It's good news and long overdue.
p298_361|p298|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p298_349|p298|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p298_177|p298|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p298_163|p298|It's now down in black and white.
p298_188|p298|Glasgow then took control.
p298_003|p298|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p298_017|p298|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p298_201|p298|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p298_215|p298|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
p298_229|p298|But there has never been the time, she said.
p253_152|p253|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p253_146|p253|Who would have?
p253_387|p253|They are good.
p253_378|p253|Does that put pressure on us?
p253_350|p253|That would help.
p253_344|p253|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p253_218|p253|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p253_224|p253|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p253_230|p253|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p253_026|p253|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p253_032|p253|Help is needed.
p253_033|p253|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p253_027|p253|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p253_231|p253|We are so proud.
p253_225|p253|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p253_219|p253|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p253_345|p253|As, indeed, they would be.
p253_351|p253|My husband was angry.
p253_379|p253|At the last I found a bunker.
p253_386|p253|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p253_392|p253|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p253_147|p253|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p253_153|p253|The weather forecast isn't good.
p253_184|p253|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p253_190|p253|It caused a lot of upset.
p253_186|p253|Does this matter?
p253_192|p253|We speak about the performance.
p253_179|p253|The goals were good.
p253_145|p253|I was awful.
p253_151|p253|I was stunned.
p253_384|p253|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p253_390|p253|I've had my time.
p253_409|p253|We went straight into the bedroom.
p253_233|p253|Of course I was tempted.
p253_227|p253|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p253_031|p253|He was jailed for five years.
p253_025|p253|But it failed.
p253_024|p253|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p253_030|p253|This is the window.
p253_018|p253|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p253_226|p253|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p253_232|p253|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p253_352|p253|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p253_346|p253|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p253_408|p253|It is legally binding.
p253_391|p253|It will take place in July.
p253_385|p253|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p253_150|p253|There was a substantial explosion.
p253_144|p253|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p253_178|p253|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p253_187|p253|Our team is just so young.
p253_183|p253|They need to look after themselves.
p253_197|p253|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p253_140|p253|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p253_154|p253|They have not been named.
p253_168|p253|I was in the train station overnight.
p253_381|p253|It's a real problem.
p253_342|p253|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p253_356|p253|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p253_236|p253|The minister is the engineer.
p253_222|p253|I'd never seen a play about me.
p253_034|p253|It is marvellous.
p253_020|p253|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p253_008|p253|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p253_009|p253|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p253_021|p253|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p253_035|p253|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p253_223|p253|It's not before time.
p253_237|p253|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p253_357|p253|Their time has gone.
p253_343|p253|Yet he left a few days later.
p253_394|p253|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p253_380|p253|Yet the data is compelling.
p253_169|p253|We have a budget in March.
p253_141|p253|She died at her home.
p253_196|p253|I came home by ambulance.
p253_182|p253|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p253_194|p253|Peace was won.
p253_180|p253|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p253_157|p253|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p253_143|p253|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p253_382|p253|It's just outrageous.
p253_355|p253|This is a club on the rise.
p253_341|p253|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p253_369|p253|Colour was at the core of his life.
p253_221|p253|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p253_235|p253|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p253_209|p253|It had all been arranged.
p253_023|p253|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p253_037|p253|They're just different.
p253_036|p253|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p253_208|p253|Twaddle is a case in point.
p253_234|p253|It's quite a line-up!
p253_220|p253|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p253_368|p253|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p253_340|p253|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p253_354|p253|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p253_383|p253|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p253_397|p253|What would be the point?
p253_142|p253|He realises his mistake.
p253_156|p253|My Dad is a hero.
p253_181|p253|It's an idea.
p253_195|p253|It's a fact.
p253_119|p253|It is rubbish.
p253_131|p253|I am now unemployed.
p253_125|p253|There were no grounds for his action.
p253_333|p253|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p253_327|p253|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p253_290|p253|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p253_247|p253|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p253_253|p253|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p253_086|p253|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p253_092|p253|We are on the path of change.
p253_079|p253|People must remain vigilant.
p253_045|p253|They want to be entertained.
p253_051|p253|It is bizarre.
p253_050|p253|A neighbour said.
p253_044|p253|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p253_078|p253|The party is up for it.
p253_093|p253|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p253_087|p253|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p253_252|p253|they fail to engage.
p253_291|p253|Nothing is safe.
p253_285|p253|Who did the recruiting?
p253_326|p253|Three years ago he would have been.
p253_332|p253|This is a friendly match?
p253_124|p253|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p253_130|p253|No production was achieved.
p253_118|p253|The mood is upbeat.
p253_126|p253|I'm so angry.
p253_132|p253|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p253_318|p253|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p253_324|p253|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p253_330|p253|I've got no secret.
p253_293|p253|One was a lawyer.
p253_287|p253|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p253_278|p253|You've got to have both sides.
p253_250|p253|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p253_244|p253|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p253_091|p253|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p253_085|p253|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p253_052|p253|There is no reason at all.
p253_046|p253|It's the only thing.
p253_047|p253|You had better believe it.
p253_053|p253|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p253_084|p253|I first met him last summer.
p253_090|p253|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p253_245|p253|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p253_251|p253|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p253_279|p253|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p253_292|p253|But it's a subtle process.
p253_331|p253|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p253_319|p253|Feel the air, the space.
p253_133|p253|It plans to return to this field.
p253_127|p253|She really suffered for her art.
p253_123|p253|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p253_335|p253|They should take their mobile phones.
p253_309|p253|She is very distinctive.
p253_296|p253|They are wrong.
p253_282|p253|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p253_255|p253|They must play for each other.
p253_241|p253|The scene is about this?
p253_269|p253|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p253_080|p253|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p253_057|p253|I was lost.
p253_043|p253|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p253_042|p253|Dancing was her life.
p253_056|p253|Here's a clue.
p253_081|p253|What has changed?
p253_095|p253|Yet, it worked.
p253_268|p253|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p253_240|p253|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p253_254|p253|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p253_283|p253|Who will perform?
p253_297|p253|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p253_308|p253|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p253_334|p253|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p253_320|p253|Is there a new way forward?
p253_136|p253|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p253_122|p253|We enjoyed it today.
p253_134|p253|We work well together.
p253_120|p253|Who would be a referee?
p253_108|p253|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p253_336|p253|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p253_322|p253|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p253_281|p253|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p253_242|p253|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p253_256|p253|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p253_083|p253|He is in the queue.
p253_097|p253|I love the Dome.
p253_040|p253|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p253_054|p253|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p253_068|p253|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p253_069|p253|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p253_055|p253|Our people are ready.
p253_041|p253|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p253_096|p253|He's been hit by it.
p253_082|p253|I will miss him.
p253_257|p253|There's not much money in cycling.
p253_243|p253|My son was too young to die.
p253_294|p253|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p253_280|p253|Dialogue is the key.
p253_323|p253|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p253_337|p253|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p253_109|p253|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p253_121|p253|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p253_135|p253|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p253_138|p253|I was dead.
p253_110|p253|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p253_104|p253|That would be unlawful.
p253_299|p253|It could work.
p253_266|p253|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p253_272|p253|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p253_058|p253|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p253_064|p253|That's the truth.
p253_071|p253|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p253_065|p253|It seems to have worked.
p253_059|p253|My fitness was very poor.
p253_273|p253|She looked so young.
p253_267|p253|One knows the feeling.
p253_298|p253|There were no passengers on board.
p253_307|p253|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p253_313|p253|We are in the end game.
p253_111|p253|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p253_139|p253|I don't know the full story.
p253_107|p253|It was an adventure.
p253_113|p253|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p253_339|p253|She is free.
p253_305|p253|The letters are going out today.
p253_311|p253|You may have a short memory.
p253_271|p253|She failed in her action.
p253_265|p253|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p253_098|p253|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p253_073|p253|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p253_067|p253|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p253_066|p253|This is the first step.
p253_072|p253|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p253_099|p253|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p253_264|p253|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p253_270|p253|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p253_258|p253|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p253_310|p253|We have got to get the points from this one.
p253_304|p253|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p253_338|p253|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p253_112|p253|Is that right?
p253_106|p253|Oil embargo endorsed.
p253_102|p253|They make a selective perception process.
p253_116|p253|It is so sad.
p253_300|p253|This is a war over our home.
p253_314|p253|It will work.
p253_328|p253|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p253_274|p253|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p253_260|p253|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p253_248|p253|That could be in place by next year.
p253_089|p253|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p253_076|p253|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p253_062|p253|I expect a rapid response.
p253_063|p253|It happened so quickly.
p253_077|p253|It is a job creation scheme.
p253_088|p253|They lived for their children.
p253_249|p253|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p253_261|p253|He has not created a Festival resource.
p253_275|p253|It's so awful.
p253_329|p253|Two people were interviewed.
p253_301|p253|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p253_117|p253|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p253_103|p253|Two of the team became ill.
p253_115|p253|It was the eighties.
p253_101|p253|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p253_129|p253|It's not a U-turn.
p253_317|p253|Our message was inclusive.
p253_303|p253|You should be.
p253_288|p253|I was the sheep.
p253_263|p253|He was also married with two children.
p253_277|p253|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p253_061|p253|It is unique.
p253_075|p253|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p253_049|p253|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p253_048|p253|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p253_074|p253|It could take some time.
p253_060|p253|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p253_276|p253|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p253_262|p253|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p253_289|p253|I was brought up in a mining background.
p253_302|p253|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p253_316|p253|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p253_128|p253|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p253_100|p253|It is a love affair.
p253_114|p253|It's a shame.
p253_198|p253|Is that success?
p253_173|p253|In a way he was.
p253_167|p253|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p253_359|p253|The death rates are still as high.
p253_371|p253|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p253_403|p253|went on sale.
p253_365|p253|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p253_239|p253|Our policy is clear.
p253_205|p253|We have an election in eight days.
p253_211|p253|Work has started.
p253_007|p253|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p253_013|p253|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p253_012|p253|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p253_238|p253|It is hard won.
p253_402|p253|He got his degree.
p253_364|p253|It is a simple equation.
p253_358|p253|He could make it.
p253_199|p253|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p253_158|p253|Words were not required.
p253_164|p253|I'd love to be like Peter.
p253_170|p253|We should do everything at a stroke.
p253_399|p253|It might be.
p253_366|p253|It was a funny game.
p253_400|p253|The weekly average was three hours.
p253_372|p253|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p253_212|p253|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p253_206|p253|Feel the heat?
p253_038|p253|It was clear.
p253_010|p253|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p253_004|p253|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p253_005|p253|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p253_011|p253|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p253_039|p253|Indeed, he does.
p253_207|p253|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p253_213|p253|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p253_373|p253|Something is wrong.
p253_367|p253|There wasn't a goal.
p253_401|p253|Relief was beyond belief.
p253_171|p253|You had to go and see him.
p253_165|p253|I've put my own money into this project.
p253_161|p253|Well, he should know.
p253_175|p253|Blair's response was weak.
p253_149|p253|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p253_388|p253|I'm glad I came.
p253_405|p253|Until they came to do it.
p253_363|p253|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p253_377|p253|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p253_217|p253|Then another one came.
p253_203|p253|It was worth a photograph.
p253_015|p253|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p253_001|p253|Please call Stella.  
p253_029|p253|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p253_028|p253|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p253_014|p253|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p253_202|p253|Sadly, it can't.
p253_216|p253|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p253_376|p253|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p253_410|p253|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p253_404|p253|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p253_148|p253|It is not just about pay.
p253_160|p253|Life becomes a song.
p253_189|p253|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p253_176|p253|As we worked.
p253_162|p253|Was this element always there?
p253_374|p253|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p253_360|p253|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p253_348|p253|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p253_200|p253|Who will pay for this?
p253_214|p253|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p253_228|p253|My wife and family are the support system.
p253_002|p253|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p253_016|p253|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
p253_017|p253|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p253_003|p253|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p253_229|p253|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p253_215|p253|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p253_201|p253|It's all about money, money, money.
p253_349|p253|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p253_361|p253|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p253_407|p253|That may be.
p253_375|p253|That's the name of the game, though.
p253_163|p253|These days are long gone.
p253_177|p253|We are the gateway to justice.
p253_188|p253|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p265_144|p265|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p265_150|p265|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p265_178|p265|One was a lawyer.
p265_346|p265|It's been hard.
p265_352|p265|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p265_232|p265|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p265_226|p265|Wealth is relative.
p265_030|p265|It's a fact.
p265_024|p265|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p265_018|p265|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p265_019|p265|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p265_025|p265|Is this accurate?
p265_031|p265|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p265_227|p265|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p265_233|p265|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p265_347|p265|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p265_179|p265|I put the drawing down.
p265_151|p265|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p265_145|p265|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p265_192|p265|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p265_186|p265|It was very frightened and dirty.
p265_190|p265|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p265_184|p265|Peace was won.
p265_153|p265|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p265_147|p265|Well, he should know.
p265_351|p265|He was the architect.
p265_345|p265|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p265_225|p265|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p265_231|p265|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p265_219|p265|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p265_027|p265|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p265_033|p265|It was clear.
p265_032|p265|It has failed.
p265_026|p265|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p265_218|p265|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p265_230|p265|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p265_224|p265|Until they came to do it.
p265_344|p265|He could face a jail sentence.
p265_350|p265|So there, we won.
p265_146|p265|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p265_152|p265|It has to be now.
p265_185|p265|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p265_191|p265|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p265_195|p265|It was worth a photograph.
p265_181|p265|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p265_156|p265|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p265_142|p265|They have not been named.
p265_340|p265|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p265_208|p265|That has been the easy part.
p265_220|p265|We were awful.
p265_234|p265|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p265_022|p265|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p265_036|p265|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p265_037|p265|Dancing was her life.
p265_023|p265|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p265_235|p265|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p265_221|p265|We are so proud.
p265_209|p265|But she was.
p265_341|p265|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p265_143|p265|We are now up against it.
p265_157|p265|They will do their own thing.
p265_180|p265|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p265_194|p265|It's all about money, money, money.
p265_182|p265|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p265_196|p265|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p265_169|p265|They know no other way.
p265_141|p265|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p265_155|p265|Seven people were later detained by police.
p265_343|p265|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p265_237|p265|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p265_223|p265|I can leave at the end of the day.
p265_035|p265|Indeed, he does.
p265_021|p265|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p265_020|p265|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p265_034|p265|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p265_008|p265|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p265_222|p265|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p265_236|p265|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p265_342|p265|There was a substantial explosion.
p265_154|p265|It is not like us.
p265_140|p265|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p265_168|p265|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p265_197|p265|I don't want to use it.
p265_183|p265|It is a farce.
p265_127|p265|I was dead.
p265_133|p265|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p265_325|p265|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p265_331|p265|There is no excuse.
p265_319|p265|Two people were interviewed.
p265_292|p265|Last night was a key episode.
p265_286|p265|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p265_251|p265|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p265_245|p265|That could be in place by next year.
p265_279|p265|Yet, it worked.
p265_090|p265|Journalists should make him.
p265_084|p265|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p265_053|p265|They are real.
p265_047|p265|It is unique.
p265_046|p265|There was no safety net.
p265_052|p265|It's that kind of place.
p265_085|p265|This one did.
p265_091|p265|It is a love affair.
p265_278|p265|It was a virus.
p265_244|p265|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p265_250|p265|We have to expand.
p265_287|p265|There is no openness.
p265_293|p265|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p265_318|p265|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p265_330|p265|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p265_324|p265|They should take their mobile phones.
p265_132|p265|He realises his mistake.
p265_126|p265|It is a time bomb.
p265_130|p265|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p265_124|p265|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p265_118|p265|It plans to return to this field.
p265_332|p265|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p265_326|p265|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p265_285|p265|What has altered?
p265_291|p265|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p265_246|p265|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p265_252|p265|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p265_087|p265|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p265_093|p265|May not have been at fault?
p265_044|p265|This is a club on the rise.
p265_050|p265|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p265_078|p265|They lived for their children.
p265_079|p265|It will be tight.
p265_051|p265|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p265_045|p265|I guess I was lucky, though.
p265_092|p265|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p265_086|p265|They are now divorced.
p265_253|p265|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p265_247|p265|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p265_290|p265|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p265_284|p265|We are not going to forget.
p265_327|p265|Tell us about it.
p265_333|p265|The pair are very much in love.
p265_119|p265|They took a risk.
p265_125|p265|Is that it?
p265_131|p265|She died at her home.
p265_109|p265|Who would be a referee?
p265_135|p265|That group reported just before Christmas.
p265_121|p265|What will happen then?
p265_337|p265|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p265_323|p265|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p265_280|p265|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p265_294|p265|You are the glory.
p265_243|p265|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p265_257|p265|I am just trying to do my job.
p265_082|p265|It is a lifeline.
p265_096|p265|Oil embargo endorsed.
p265_069|p265|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p265_041|p265|A neighbour said.
p265_055|p265|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p265_054|p265|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p265_040|p265|This represents a tough game for us.
p265_068|p265|The results are tragic.
p265_097|p265|He takes the job.
p265_083|p265|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p265_256|p265|Souter will be back.
p265_242|p265|There's the mix.
p265_295|p265|The minister is the engineer.
p265_281|p265|This is a national crisis.
p265_322|p265|This is a friendly match?
p265_336|p265|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p265_120|p265|We work well together.
p265_134|p265|The idea is simple.
p265_108|p265|It is rubbish.
p265_122|p265|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p265_136|p265|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p265_308|p265|Either team will be hard.
p265_320|p265|I'm very lucky.
p265_334|p265|As, indeed, they would be.
p265_297|p265|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
p265_283|p265|So I did.
p265_268|p265|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p265_254|p265|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p265_240|p265|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p265_095|p265|We have an election in eight days.
p265_081|p265|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p265_056|p265|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p265_042|p265|Among them are many criminals.
p265_043|p265|She looked so young.
p265_057|p265|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p265_080|p265|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p265_094|p265|They tried to deny it.
p265_241|p265|It was a hit.
p265_255|p265|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p265_269|p265|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p265_282|p265|Who did the recruiting?
p265_296|p265|The letters are going out today.
p265_335|p265|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p265_321|p265|It's very good.
p265_309|p265|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p265_137|p265|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p265_123|p265|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p265_106|p265|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p265_112|p265|That's all right then.
p265_304|p265|They had a confession.
p265_310|p265|My view has now completely changed.
p265_338|p265|That would help.
p265_270|p265|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p265_264|p265|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p265_258|p265|Blood samples were taken.
p265_099|p265|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p265_072|p265|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p265_066|p265|Is there a new way forward?
p265_067|p265|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p265_073|p265|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p265_098|p265|She reflects a bit.
p265_259|p265|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p265_265|p265|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p265_271|p265|We have to break that cycle.
p265_339|p265|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p265_311|p265|The party is up for it.
p265_305|p265|It will work.
p265_113|p265|I'm so angry.
p265_107|p265|You had better believe it.
p265_111|p265|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p265_105|p265|It was the eighties.
p265_139|p265|I was stunned.
p265_313|p265|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p265_307|p265|It's too horrible to think.
p265_298|p265|Is there on his hands?
p265_267|p265|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p265_273|p265|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p265_065|p265|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p265_071|p265|What has changed?
p265_059|p265|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p265_058|p265|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p265_070|p265|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p265_064|p265|Neither it is.
p265_272|p265|He looked very sharp.
p265_266|p265|They seem to get away with it.
p265_299|p265|We are a peaceful people.
p265_306|p265|I came into this world with nothing.
p265_312|p265|Is that an issue?
p265_138|p265|You know the type.
p265_104|p265|It's a shame.
p265_110|p265|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p265_128|p265|I don't know the full story.
p265_114|p265|Holland won by five wickets.
p265_100|p265|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p265_316|p265|Who will do it?
p265_302|p265|My body is clearly capable.
p265_289|p265|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p265_262|p265|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p265_276|p265|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p265_048|p265|I expect a rapid response.
p265_060|p265|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p265_074|p265|A play is a set of actions.
p265_075|p265|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p265_061|p265|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p265_049|p265|TODAY it begins.
p265_277|p265|Dialogue is the key.
p265_263|p265|It's a way of life.
p265_288|p265|I can live with it.
p265_303|p265|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p265_317|p265|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p265_101|p265|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p265_115|p265|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p265_129|p265|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p265_103|p265|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p265_117|p265|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p265_329|p265|But we finished the show.
p265_301|p265|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p265_315|p265|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p265_249|p265|Chelsea was a great club.
p265_275|p265|You've got to have both sides.
p265_088|p265|I saw the whole thing.
p265_077|p265|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p265_063|p265|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p265_076|p265|By then, he was walking on water.
p265_089|p265|It was mayhem.
p265_260|p265|This is a question of Islam.
p265_274|p265|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p265_248|p265|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p265_314|p265|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p265_300|p265|Kids are terrible.
p265_328|p265|She said they would appeal.
p265_116|p265|Twaddle is a case in point.
p265_102|p265|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p265_165|p265|It is not either national standards or local control.
p265_171|p265|It's an idea.
p265_159|p265|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p265_213|p265|It's not before time.
p265_207|p265|Because they didn't want to know.
p265_011|p265|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p265_005|p265|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p265_039|p265|It's the only thing.
p265_038|p265|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p265_004|p265|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p265_010|p265|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p265_206|p265|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p265_212|p265|I'd never seen a play about me.
p265_158|p265|You had to go and see him.
p265_170|p265|I've been there.
p265_164|p265|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p265_199|p265|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p265_172|p265|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p265_166|p265|He deserved the win.
p265_204|p265|I might come back.
p265_210|p265|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p265_238|p265|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p265_006|p265|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p265_012|p265|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p265_013|p265|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p265_007|p265|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p265_239|p265|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p265_211|p265|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p265_205|p265|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p265_167|p265|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p265_173|p265|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p265_198|p265|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p265_188|p265|The service from the other players was super.
p265_177|p265|Does this matter?
p265_163|p265|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p265_349|p265|Safety was also an issue.
p265_229|p265|It's quite nice.
p265_201|p265|People must remain vigilant.
p265_215|p265|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p265_003|p265|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p265_017|p265|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p265_016|p265|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p265_002|p265|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p265_214|p265|The report is due out next month.
p265_200|p265|I had decided to quit the show.
p265_228|p265|You should be.
p265_348|p265|A review is under way.
p265_162|p265|Blair's response was weak.
p265_176|p265|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p265_189|p265|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p265_148|p265|I will tell you.
p265_160|p265|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p265_174|p265|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p265_216|p265|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p265_202|p265|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p265_028|p265|This is the window.
p265_014|p265|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p265_015|p265|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p265_029|p265|We speak about the performance.
p265_203|p265|He seemed to lose his focus.
p265_217|p265|At the time, he was a living legend.
p265_175|p265|They need to look after themselves.
p265_161|p265|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p265_149|p265|I've put my own money into this project.
p262_104|p262|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p262_110|p262|They were behind the wheel.
p262_138|p262|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p262_070|p262|Then followed a bout of flu.
p262_064|p262|He was popular.
p262_058|p262|Jobs could go.
p262_272|p262|It's not even finished.
p262_266|p262|We shall rely on human beings.
p262_299|p262|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p262_298|p262|The results are sometimes contentious.
p262_267|p262|Immediate action must be taken.
p262_273|p262|Things can change.
p262_059|p262|And a film maker was born.
p262_065|p262|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p262_071|p262|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p262_139|p262|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p262_111|p262|This film will be totally awesome.
p262_105|p262|He pleaded for caution.
p262_313|p262|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p262_307|p262|However, the groups denied the claims.
p262_311|p262|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p262_305|p262|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p262_339|p262|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p262_113|p262|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p262_107|p262|It's a shame.
p262_067|p262|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p262_073|p262|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p262_098|p262|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p262_265|p262|They wanted the club to make money.
p262_271|p262|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p262_259|p262|This is a big club.
p262_258|p262|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p262_270|p262|It was an easy decision to come here.
p262_264|p262|At first I thought I was gone.
p262_099|p262|Two of the team became ill.
p262_072|p262|I had my suspicions.
p262_066|p262|It is like a river running by my home.
p262_106|p262|They are ready.
p262_112|p262|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p262_338|p262|The team for the first game could be this one.
p262_304|p262|What has altered?
p262_310|p262|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p262_328|p262|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p262_314|p262|The letters are going out today.
p262_300|p262|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p262_116|p262|Who would have?
p262_102|p262|It was an adventure.
p262_062|p262|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p262_076|p262|I'd like to continue that record.
p262_089|p262|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p262_248|p262|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p262_260|p262|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p262_274|p262|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p262_275|p262|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p262_261|p262|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p262_249|p262|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p262_088|p262|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p262_077|p262|Detection is often difficult.
p262_063|p262|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p262_103|p262|It's not perfect.
p262_117|p262|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p262_301|p262|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p262_315|p262|We want to play at the worlds.
p262_329|p262|We are in the end game.
p262_303|p262|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p262_317|p262|Special measures were needed.
p262_129|p262|It's a question of fashion.
p262_101|p262|It is a good lifestyle.
p262_115|p262|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p262_049|p262|He had no enemies.
p262_075|p262|What has changed?
p262_061|p262|There was a battle there.
p262_277|p262|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p262_263|p262|I saw one body.
p262_288|p262|The mood is good.
p262_289|p262|This is a national crisis.
p262_262|p262|I am very angry.
p262_276|p262|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p262_060|p262|I fell against him.
p262_074|p262|I've not thought about it.
p262_048|p262|They had to explain it.
p262_114|p262|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p262_100|p262|Oil embargo endorsed.
p262_128|p262|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p262_316|p262|Is there on his hands?
p262_302|p262|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p262_365|p262|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p262_371|p262|It was a funny game.
p262_359|p262|He's very explosive.
p262_167|p262|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p262_173|p262|Is Saddam a threat?
p262_198|p262|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p262_013|p262|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p262_007|p262|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p262_211|p262|I had decided to quit the show.
p262_205|p262|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p262_239|p262|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p262_238|p262|He was good, but not that good.
p262_204|p262|There was no rescue.
p262_210|p262|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p262_006|p262|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p262_012|p262|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p262_199|p262|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p262_172|p262|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p262_166|p262|We have a budget in March.
p262_358|p262|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p262_370|p262|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p262_364|p262|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p262_372|p262|It is a large number.
p262_366|p262|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p262_170|p262|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p262_164|p262|It is not too late to get on board.
p262_158|p262|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p262_004|p262|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p262_010|p262|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p262_038|p262|The problem is the pitch.
p262_206|p262|But I am a worried man.
p262_212|p262|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p262_213|p262|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p262_207|p262|There was an e-mail.
p262_039|p262|It was ugly.
p262_011|p262|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p262_005|p262|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p262_159|p262|As, indeed, they would be.
p262_165|p262|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p262_171|p262|We've made a couple of albums.
p262_367|p262|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p262_373|p262|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p262_377|p262|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p262_363|p262|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p262_388|p262|They are good.
p262_149|p262|I knew he was good.
p262_175|p262|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p262_161|p262|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p262_029|p262|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p262_001|p262|Please call Stella.  
p262_015|p262|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p262_203|p262|It's all about money, money, money.
p262_217|p262|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p262_216|p262|His death was a tragic accident.
p262_202|p262|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p262_014|p262|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p262_028|p262|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p262_160|p262|They are not advertised.
p262_174|p262|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p262_148|p262|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p262_389|p262|It was a breathtaking moment.
p262_362|p262|That would help.
p262_376|p262|Something is wrong.
p262_348|p262|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p262_360|p262|It was one in the afternoon.
p262_374|p262|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p262_162|p262|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p262_176|p262|The clarity is vital.
p262_189|p262|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p262_016|p262|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p262_002|p262|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p262_228|p262|However, no further action was taken by police.
p262_214|p262|He seemed to lose his focus.
p262_200|p262|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p262_201|p262|They are in the euro.
p262_215|p262|Work has started.
p262_229|p262|It's that kind of place.
p262_003|p262|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p262_017|p262|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p262_188|p262|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p262_177|p262|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p262_163|p262|It's that sort of night.
p262_375|p262|I am a wealthy person.
p262_361|p262|We will be homeless.
p262_349|p262|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p262_344|p262|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p262_350|p262|I got a yellow card.
p262_378|p262|I am very happy with life.
p262_387|p262|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p262_393|p262|Emotions were complex.
p262_146|p262|We should be clear about the role of government.
p262_152|p262|Neither side can win this war.
p262_185|p262|I had a train to catch.
p262_191|p262|I came home by ambulance.
p262_032|p262|This is the window.
p262_026|p262|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p262_230|p262|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p262_224|p262|The track is currently covered in snow.
p262_218|p262|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p262_219|p262|We have not given up hope.
p262_225|p262|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p262_231|p262|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p262_027|p262|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p262_033|p262|People love to see this stuff.
p262_190|p262|It wasn't to be.
p262_184|p262|Miller was every bit as happy.
p262_153|p262|He can do no wrong.
p262_147|p262|It is a freedom.
p262_392|p262|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p262_386|p262|We're looking for justice.
p262_379|p262|I was so nervous.
p262_351|p262|There is no link.
p262_345|p262|It was forced to divert.
p262_353|p262|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p262_347|p262|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p262_390|p262|It was on fire.
p262_384|p262|It was important to win the singles.
p262_151|p262|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p262_145|p262|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p262_179|p262|That has been the easy part.
p262_192|p262|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p262_186|p262|That would be my view.
p262_025|p262|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p262_031|p262|I expected these kind of questions.
p262_019|p262|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p262_227|p262|The Dow Jones is way up.
p262_233|p262|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p262_232|p262|It's very safe.
p262_226|p262|At the time, he was a living legend.
p262_018|p262|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p262_030|p262|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p262_024|p262|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p262_187|p262|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p262_193|p262|Our strategy is straightforward.
p262_178|p262|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p262_144|p262|Mr Blair had done well.
p262_150|p262|They were later discharged from hospital.
p262_385|p262|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p262_391|p262|This is a major step forward for carers.
p262_346|p262|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p262_352|p262|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p262_356|p262|It is horrible.
p262_342|p262|I would miss him.
p262_381|p262|However, it's good to turn the page.
p262_168|p262|The post will be unpaid.
p262_154|p262|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p262_140|p262|It is huge.
p262_197|p262|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p262_183|p262|They need to look after themselves.
p262_008|p262|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p262_020|p262|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p262_034|p262|Life was like a timetable.
p262_222|p262|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p262_236|p262|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p262_237|p262|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p262_223|p262|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p262_035|p262|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p262_021|p262|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p262_009|p262|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p262_182|p262|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p262_196|p262|The service from the other players was super.
p262_141|p262|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p262_155|p262|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p262_169|p262|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p262_380|p262|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p262_394|p262|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p262_343|p262|It will be very, very tight.
p262_357|p262|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p262_369|p262|Talks are progressing.
p262_341|p262|His views are hardly surprising.
p262_355|p262|A man has since been charged with his murder.
p262_382|p262|It would be a massive boost for them.
p262_143|p262|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p262_157|p262|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p262_180|p262|He will need that machine.
p262_194|p262|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p262_037|p262|It was clear.
p262_023|p262|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p262_209|p262|We'll have to work hard today.
p262_235|p262|But it's a subtle process.
p262_221|p262|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p262_220|p262|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p262_234|p262|It is a terrible loss.
p262_208|p262|It's a big deal for me.
p262_022|p262|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p262_036|p262|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p262_195|p262|People acted too quickly.
p262_181|p262|Nothing is safe.
p262_156|p262|He's been the key to everything.
p262_142|p262|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p262_383|p262|The release attracted little attention.
p262_354|p262|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p262_340|p262|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p262_368|p262|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p262_327|p262|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p262_333|p262|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p262_125|p262|The goals were good.
p262_131|p262|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p262_119|p262|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p262_051|p262|Next league matches Celtic.
p262_045|p262|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p262_079|p262|All options are open.
p262_092|p262|They are now divorced.
p262_086|p262|Today I couldn't run on it.
p262_253|p262|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p262_247|p262|The scene is about this?
p262_290|p262|The death toll included five children.
p262_284|p262|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p262_285|p262|He will address the nation this evening.
p262_291|p262|Who did the recruiting?
p262_246|p262|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p262_252|p262|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p262_087|p262|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p262_093|p262|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p262_078|p262|He is driven.
p262_044|p262|It is difficult for Ali.
p262_050|p262|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p262_118|p262|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p262_130|p262|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p262_124|p262|Our intentions are real.
p262_332|p262|I am so upset.
p262_326|p262|He said she was mad.
p262_330|p262|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p262_324|p262|The problems began a long time ago.
p262_318|p262|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p262_132|p262|We need to chat.
p262_126|p262|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p262_046|p262|I was angry.
p262_052|p262|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p262_085|p262|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p262_091|p262|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p262_244|p262|They may yet have the last laugh.
p262_250|p262|I was shocked.
p262_278|p262|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p262_287|p262|It was a virus.
p262_293|p262|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p262_292|p262|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p262_286|p262|The attacker died in the crash.
p262_279|p262|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p262_251|p262|A friendship that will endure.
p262_245|p262|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p262_090|p262|Then came the crunch.
p262_084|p262|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p262_053|p262|It's very odd.
p262_047|p262|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p262_127|p262|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p262_133|p262|She died at her home.
p262_319|p262|I never thought it would take this long.
p262_325|p262|My body is clearly capable.
p262_331|p262|The parents will have a great time, too.
p262_309|p262|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p262_335|p262|He was then replaced by Ross.
p262_321|p262|We are a peaceful people.
p262_137|p262|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p262_123|p262|It plans to return to this field.
p262_043|p262|It's a crucial award.
p262_057|p262|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p262_080|p262|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p262_094|p262|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p262_269|p262|He was also married with two children.
p262_241|p262|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p262_255|p262|That could be in place by next year.
p262_282|p262|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p262_296|p262|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p262_297|p262|And huge, indeed, it is.
p262_283|p262|I saw it at a ruck.
p262_254|p262|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p262_240|p262|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p262_268|p262|It's very nice.
p262_095|p262|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p262_081|p262|Someone who cares
p262_056|p262|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p262_042|p262|The judge said.
p262_122|p262|It was the same at Twickenham.
p262_136|p262|That group reported just before Christmas.
p262_320|p262|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p262_334|p262|It could have gone either way.
p262_308|p262|They should be swept away.
p262_322|p262|It should be equal.
p262_336|p262|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p262_108|p262|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p262_120|p262|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p262_134|p262|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p262_068|p262|It's all I can do.
p262_054|p262|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p262_040|p262|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p262_097|p262|It is a good day for the coalition.
p262_083|p262|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p262_256|p262|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p262_242|p262|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p262_295|p262|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p262_281|p262|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p262_280|p262|We have to break that cycle.
p262_294|p262|Well, he can do it.
p262_243|p262|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p262_257|p262|We run within the law.
p262_082|p262|It's never too late.
p262_096|p262|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p262_041|p262|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p262_055|p262|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p262_069|p262|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p262_135|p262|It would be a last resort.
p262_121|p262|So the European elections are extremely important.
p262_109|p262|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p262_337|p262|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p262_323|p262|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p236_270|p236|But they were never expected to last.
p236_258|p236|He was good, but not that good.
p236_099|p236|Before the game we went for a pint.
p236_066|p236|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p236_072|p236|These people are not big names.
p236_112|p236|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p236_489|p236|Something has got to change.
p236_310|p236|His job was not advertised.
p236_476|p236|I am a committed European.
p236_462|p236|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
p236_304|p236|He will address the nation this evening.
p236_338|p236|The game is now open.
p236_339|p236|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p236_463|p236|Not if you know the person.
p236_305|p236|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p236_311|p236|We can work all night.
p236_477|p236|Analysts said the offer was fair.
p236_488|p236|It worked well in Monaco.
p236_107|p236|They will notice a difference.
p236_113|p236|You can spend money on housing.
p236_073|p236|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p236_098|p236|We created so many chances.
p236_259|p236|It was quite a new prescription.
p236_271|p236|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p236_265|p236|You can feel at home in China.
p236_503|p236|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p236_298|p236|Does the name matter?
p236_273|p236|I told you I was ill.
p236_501|p236|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p236_267|p236|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p236_071|p236|It looks like a hit.
p236_065|p236|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p236_059|p236|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p236_105|p236|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p236_111|p236|The result is a vacuum.
p236_139|p236|That view has not altered.
p236_307|p236|The rescue package is public money.
p236_461|p236|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p236_475|p236|I could feel the blood on my face.
p236_313|p236|It was an excellent performance.
p236_449|p236|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p236_448|p236|No options are excluded at all.
p236_474|p236|He was a shooting star.
p236_312|p236|It was really very frightening.
p236_306|p236|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p236_460|p236|The chief constable has retired.
p236_138|p236|It was a piece of art.
p236_110|p236|There's still plenty time left.
p236_104|p236|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p236_058|p236|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236_064|p236|Then followed a bout of flu.
p236_070|p236|He was seen as the enemy.
p236_500|p236|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p236_266|p236|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p236_272|p236|The capital costs are modest.
p236_299|p236|how do you get it back?
p236_289|p236|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p236_276|p236|We accept the new rules.
p236_262|p236|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
p236_048|p236|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p236_074|p236|We did it for the jersey.
p236_060|p236|I have proved that in the past.
p236_128|p236|You are a gambling man.
p236_100|p236|Our house was very small.
p236_114|p236|The hearing was due to continue today.
p236_458|p236|And it covers the spectrum.
p236_464|p236|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p236_302|p236|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p236_316|p236|These figures are truly awful.
p236_470|p236|Neither woman has been named.
p236_317|p236|That is the real test.
p236_471|p236|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p236_465|p236|I was all image and no substance.
p236_303|p236|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p236_459|p236|Dennis was not so sure.
p236_115|p236|I can't even get into the A team.
p236_101|p236|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p236_129|p236|Before it was an ordeal.
p236_061|p236|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p236_075|p236|The Festival is prepared to help.
p236_049|p236|This is the interesting part.
p236_263|p236|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p236_277|p236|We run within the law.
p236_288|p236|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p236_249|p236|Do I think about them often?
p236_261|p236|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p236_275|p236|That could be in place by next year.
p236_088|p236|How do you take them away?
p236_063|p236|I was as strong as a horse.
p236_077|p236|By then, he was walking on water.
p236_117|p236|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p236_103|p236|It's not a lack of effort.
p236_498|p236|I was ready for this.
p236_329|p236|I am not obsessed with sex.
p236_473|p236|They make a selective perception process.
p236_315|p236|And we can do it.
p236_301|p236|I think, therefore I am?
p236_467|p236|It can all be done over the phone.
p236_300|p236|What are you not good at?
p236_466|p236|The boys are mentally focused.
p236_472|p236|We live by the rule of law.
p236_314|p236|The answer is with ourselves.
p236_328|p236|After some discussion they did.
p236_499|p236|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p236_102|p236|It became difficult for me.
p236_116|p236|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p236_076|p236|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p236_062|p236|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p236_089|p236|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p236_274|p236|He will go on the bench.
p236_260|p236|It is very hard for her.
p236_207|p236|My duty is to win.
p236_213|p236|The service from the other players was super.
p236_005|p236|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p236_011|p236|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p236_039|p236|That was the case with David.
p236_165|p236|We have a budget in March.
p236_159|p236|It's not like us.
p236_398|p236|So is that it, then?
p236_415|p236|I've got my own ideas.
p236_373|p236|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p236_367|p236|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p236_401|p236|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p236_429|p236|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p236_428|p236|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p236_366|p236|It's as wide as a church in here.
p236_400|p236|It certainly appeared that way.
p236_414|p236|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p236_372|p236|We used to keep our business rates.
p236_399|p236|Do I have a favourite?
p236_158|p236|We did what we had to do.
p236_164|p236|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p236_170|p236|That is not the case.
p236_038|p236|That means an extra two years.
p236_010|p236|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p236_004|p236|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p236_212|p236|They have the cash and the fire power.
p236_206|p236|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p236_210|p236|No details of the talks were given.
p236_204|p236|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p236_238|p236|This will secure the future of our industry.
p236_012|p236|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p236_006|p236|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p236_199|p236|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
p236_166|p236|He is not a team captain.
p236_172|p236|It's nice to be nice.
p236_402|p236|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p236_364|p236|She said they would appeal.
p236_370|p236|They will fight for everything.
p236_416|p236|I never had a childhood.
p236_358|p236|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p236_359|p236|Scotland is the home of golf.
p236_371|p236|The pair are very much in love.
p236_417|p236|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p236_403|p236|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
p236_365|p236|There is no deal as yet.
p236_173|p236|They could not match it.
p236_167|p236|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
p236_198|p236|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p236_007|p236|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p236_013|p236|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p236_239|p236|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p236_205|p236|It caused a lot of upset.
p236_211|p236|This will be our new beginning.
p236_229|p236|Death is outside the language.
p236_215|p236|Tommy is not a problem.
p236_201|p236|It shows the strength of the roots.
p236_017|p236|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p236_003|p236|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p236_188|p236|We are the gateway to justice.
p236_163|p236|Seven people were later detained by police.
p236_177|p236|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p236_349|p236|We put our bid in last night.
p236_361|p236|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p236_407|p236|He seems to be used to the attention.
p236_413|p236|He is on the wrong side.
p236_375|p236|Everyone could see the joke.
p236_412|p236|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p236_374|p236|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p236_360|p236|They have broken that promise.
p236_406|p236|It had been on the cards.
p236_348|p236|The confidence isn't there now.
p236_176|p236|Is there a waiting list?
p236_162|p236|I have got a wife to feed.
p236_189|p236|Tomorrow is a new day.
p236_002|p236|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p236_016|p236|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p236_200|p236|I had a train to catch.
p236_214|p236|The early physical reports were clear.
p236_228|p236|From there, they can go anywhere.
p236_202|p236|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p236_216|p236|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p236_028|p236|Because we do not need it.
p236_014|p236|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p236_148|p236|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p236_174|p236|Are they free?
p236_389|p236|My view has now completely changed.
p236_438|p236|I chose to make a film.
p236_376|p236|All would be under threat.
p236_410|p236|He may have a point.
p236_404|p236|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p236_362|p236|It's only a matter of scale.
p236_405|p236|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p236_363|p236|We must put a marker down.
p236_377|p236|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p236_411|p236|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p236_439|p236|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
p236_388|p236|It brought in new management.
p236_161|p236|It is not a financial issue.
p236_175|p236|What are they for?
p236_149|p236|I was shaking on the blocks.
p236_015|p236|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p236_029|p236|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
p236_217|p236|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p236_203|p236|This youngster is so exciting!
p236_226|p236|There was a lot of resentment.
p236_232|p236|I'm just a regular person.
p236_024|p236|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p236_030|p236|And we have a singer.
p236_018|p236|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p236_193|p236|Says the Duke of York.
p236_187|p236|The hotel was now for sale.
p236_144|p236|Like the others, he was arrested.
p236_178|p236|So what happens next?
p236_391|p236|The following day I used the story.
p236_385|p236|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p236_434|p236|But you can go beyond that condition.
p236_352|p236|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p236_346|p236|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p236_420|p236|They did the right thing.
p236_408|p236|The trick is to try it.
p236_409|p236|I would love to think that she could win.
p236_347|p236|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p236_421|p236|He will be judged by his actions.
p236_435|p236|But we have built a platform for next season.
p236_353|p236|What do we do?
p236_384|p236|They know it'll be fantastic.
p236_390|p236|She is in their hands.
p236_179|p236|Had this been common practice?
p236_145|p236|We will provide immediate access.
p236_151|p236|It was by the numbers.
p236_186|p236|City sentiment is in his favour.
p236_192|p236|I have spoken to head office.
p236_019|p236|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p236_031|p236|He was jailed for four years.
p236_025|p236|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p236_233|p236|It had all been arranged.
p236_227|p236|That might help a bit.
p236_231|p236|The course has helped a lot.
p236_225|p236|There is no quick fix.
p236_219|p236|You have caught a serial killer.
p236_033|p236|This is a central issue.
p236_027|p236|Meetings will also remain private.
p236_184|p236|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p236_190|p236|It makes no influence on the public.
p236_147|p236|We have a clean bill of health.
p236_153|p236|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p236_386|p236|Clark is back on top form.
p236_392|p236|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p236_423|p236|It is an absolute nonsense.
p236_345|p236|Three years ago he would have been.
p236_351|p236|He had no previous convictions.
p236_437|p236|He said current trading was strong.
p236_379|p236|The seller was not revealed.
p236_378|p236|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p236_350|p236|A great deal has been achieved.
p236_436|p236|It looked like a war zone.
p236_422|p236|The fate of the rest is unknown.
p236_344|p236|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p236_393|p236|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p236_387|p236|Motion described it as a unique event.
p236_152|p236|It would seem a natural progression.
p236_146|p236|He could do nothing about it.
p236_191|p236|Each case is treated on merit.
p236_185|p236|It is not either national standards or local control.
p236_026|p236|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p236_032|p236|He should emerge as the winner.
p236_218|p236|A deadline is still essential.
p236_224|p236|Which isn't a bad idea.
p236_230|p236|I had relied on him.
p236_208|p236|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p236_234|p236|His third goal was superb.
p236_220|p236|You are a great player.
p236_036|p236|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p236_181|p236|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p236_195|p236|As many as the market will support.
p236_142|p236|It has become a way of life.
p236_156|p236|It was a funny feeling.
p236_383|p236|A review is under way.
p236_397|p236|How are you, sir?
p236_368|p236|It was like a weekly wage.
p236_340|p236|Even the one she loved.
p236_426|p236|Everything in golf is a balance.
p236_432|p236|Paris is not only young.
p236_354|p236|Why do it otherwise?
p236_433|p236|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
p236_355|p236|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p236_341|p236|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p236_427|p236|It is a case of pity for us.
p236_369|p236|We are a Scottish company.
p236_396|p236|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p236_382|p236|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p236_157|p236|I'm afraid to say anything.
p236_143|p236|The whole industry is a shambles.
p236_194|p236|I had too much to drink.
p236_180|p236|What do they want us to do?
p236_023|p236|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p236_037|p236|It carried a double message.
p236_221|p236|I won't make an official complaint.
p236_235|p236|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p236_209|p236|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p236_223|p236|They are looking at a flotation.
p236_237|p236|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p236_009|p236|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p236_021|p236|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p236_035|p236|It is not for any other purpose.
p236_196|p236|They need to look after themselves.
p236_182|p236|One season, they might do well.
p236_169|p236|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p236_155|p236|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p236_141|p236|So I got a blood test.
p236_394|p236|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p236_380|p236|People are on the alert.
p236_419|p236|They were not complacent in any way.
p236_357|p236|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p236_431|p236|It was that bad, that low.
p236_425|p236|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
p236_343|p236|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p236_424|p236|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
p236_342|p236|It was almost too much.
p236_356|p236|So, did she meet him?
p236_430|p236|We've got a good management record.
p236_418|p236|I think it's a miracle.
p236_381|p236|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
p236_395|p236|I should think so, too.
p236_140|p236|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p236_154|p236|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p236_168|p236|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p236_183|p236|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p236_197|p236|That is a waste of energy.
p236_034|p236|He works at the airport.
p236_020|p236|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p236_236|p236|I am considered a teenager.
p236_222|p236|It was worth a photograph.
p236_286|p236|Much of the equipment was new.
p236_292|p236|She failed in her action.
p236_245|p236|Truth is the child of time.
p236_251|p236|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p236_279|p236|He took over our lives.
p236_084|p236|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236_090|p236|After the match, do you?
p236_047|p236|Everything else is a bonus.
p236_053|p236|We keep an eye on it.
p236_133|p236|She died at her home.
p236_127|p236|They made such decisions in London.
p236_494|p236|It was still there, but right at the end.
p236_480|p236|It is a vicious circle.
p236_331|p236|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p236_457|p236|And she is very clear on this.
p236_443|p236|We would have concerns about that.
p236_325|p236|The law will take its course.
p236_319|p236|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
p236_318|p236|They have to be addressed.
p236_442|p236|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p236_324|p236|And he goes with it.
p236_330|p236|I didn't have the reply.
p236_456|p236|They were not even allowed to see them.
p236_481|p236|He will be advised by me.
p236_495|p236|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p236_126|p236|He said to give a local injection.
p236_132|p236|They could use a boost.
p236_052|p236|That was the difference today.
p236_046|p236|He looks like an Afghan.
p236_091|p236|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p236_085|p236|Change will however have to be in euros.
p236_278|p236|We have the moral high ground.
p236_250|p236|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p236_244|p236|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p236_293|p236|Stephen will get his first cap.
p236_287|p236|Blair also had a penalty.
p236_291|p236|My body is a wreck.
p236_285|p236|They can leave at any time.
p236_252|p236|It's important to get it right.
p236_246|p236|And they were being paid?
p236_093|p236|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p236_087|p236|Does it matter?
p236_050|p236|I haven't been ill at all.
p236_044|p236|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p236_078|p236|He was just a journalist.
p236_124|p236|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p236_130|p236|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p236_118|p236|Three hours later, the man was free.
p236_483|p236|We had to add value.
p236_497|p236|He had planned to sell it.
p236_326|p236|This is a historic occasion.
p236_440|p236|But by that time, it was too late.
p236_454|p236|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p236_332|p236|These days will be back.
p236_468|p236|The bill would be massive.
p236_469|p236|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p236_455|p236|He deserved a red card.
p236_333|p236|You may have a short memory.
p236_327|p236|This ruling is a farce.
p236_441|p236|The damage is all inside.
p236_496|p236|They never gave up hope.
p236_482|p236|Winning a medal is a dream.
p236_119|p236|Which can happen any time.
p236_131|p236|We will try to find someone.
p236_125|p236|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p236_079|p236|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p236_045|p236|We are working on it.
p236_051|p236|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p236_086|p236|It was a big departure.
p236_092|p236|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p236_247|p236|Was everything done to save people?
p236_253|p236|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p236_284|p236|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p236_290|p236|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p236_294|p236|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p236_280|p236|It has all been done in secret.
p236_257|p236|I was just a kid.
p236_243|p236|We played them off the pitch.
p236_096|p236|He refused to name the survivors.
p236_069|p236|It is a job creation scheme.
p236_055|p236|We felt it was sufficient.
p236_041|p236|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p236_109|p236|New Year will be very busy.
p236_121|p236|He is a lovely man.
p236_135|p236|I enjoy the creative process.
p236_486|p236|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
p236_492|p236|The BBC was a disgrace.
p236_479|p236|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p236_445|p236|Taxes may need to rise.
p236_323|p236|A lot has been written.
p236_337|p236|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p236_451|p236|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
p236_336|p236|That decision has already been made.
p236_450|p236|We are going for it.
p236_444|p236|I know the worry over Iraq.
p236_322|p236|I can live with it.
p236_478|p236|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p236_493|p236|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
p236_487|p236|We have to go for a win.
p236_134|p236|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p236_120|p236|The colours are very pretty.
p236_108|p236|Football is a passion for many.
p236_040|p236|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p236_054|p236|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p236_068|p236|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p236_083|p236|The Queen Mother is dead.
p236_097|p236|That time is not now, however.
p236_242|p236|You have to do your research.
p236_256|p236|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p236_281|p236|They must play for each other.
p236_295|p236|And that match was played in June.
p236_283|p236|She always wanted her own way.
p236_297|p236|What do we want to do that for?
p236_268|p236|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p236_240|p236|People should make their own decisions.
p236_254|p236|Those overseas offices were great.
p236_081|p236|We have turned the corner.
p236_095|p236|I had a ball today.
p236_042|p236|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p236_056|p236|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p236_136|p236|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p236_122|p236|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p236_491|p236|Our fans have been marvellous.
p236_485|p236|It happens on an annual basis.
p236_308|p236|I was there five months ago.
p236_452|p236|It is a cause for concern.
p236_320|p236|Cast Away now on general release.
p236_446|p236|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p236_321|p236|All winners should be tested.
p236_447|p236|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p236_453|p236|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p236_335|p236|There was no time scale.
p236_309|p236|I am a retailer by nature.
p236_484|p236|That is the bottom line.
p236_490|p236|I had it before the final.
p236_123|p236|I was on a roll.
p236_137|p236|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p236_057|p236|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p236_043|p236|Their campaign is in disarray.
p236_094|p236|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p236_080|p236|They lived for their children.
p236_255|p236|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p236_241|p236|They said that they stood by their statement.
p236_269|p236|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p236_296|p236|I saw it at a ruck.
p236_282|p236|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p231_224|p231|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p231_230|p231|They are the innocent victims.
p231_218|p231|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p231_350|p231|Is there a waiting list?
p231_436|p231|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p231_422|p231|Yet the data is compelling.
p231_344|p231|He was then replaced by Ross.
p231_378|p231|to have products for their needs.
p231_393|p231|But we are very near.
p231_387|p231|I wanted to go out on a high.
p231_152|p231|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p231_146|p231|It has become a way of life.
p231_191|p231|We represent a wide range of society.
p231_185|p231|As many as the market will support.
p231_184|p231|So many people will be affected by this.
p231_190|p231|I'm interested in interesting work.
p231_147|p231|The whole industry is a shambles.
p231_153|p231|He was asked to quit.
p231_386|p231|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p231_392|p231|There was a substantial explosion.
p231_379|p231|The pair are very much in love.
p231_423|p231|It was important to win the singles.
p231_345|p231|Finally came the moment of truth.
p231_351|p231|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p231_437|p231|The growth potential is enormous.
p231_219|p231|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p231_231|p231|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p231_225|p231|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p231_033|p231|It carried a double message.
p231_027|p231|Because we do not need it.
p231_031|p231|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p231_025|p231|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p231_019|p231|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p231_233|p231|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p231_347|p231|What form did that take?
p231_421|p231|There is a solution, she believes.
p231_435|p231|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p231_353|p231|The units will not be replaced.
p231_409|p231|How do you take them away?
p231_384|p231|Does it matter?
p231_390|p231|It was fit for royalty.
p231_145|p231|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p231_151|p231|It is not normal practice.
p231_179|p231|But one was not enough.
p231_186|p231|They need to look after themselves.
p231_192|p231|People will ask about us.
p231_193|p231|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p231_178|p231|We are the gateway to justice.
p231_150|p231|We have a clean bill of health.
p231_144|p231|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p231_391|p231|The response from them was good.
p231_385|p231|You have to rely on each other.
p231_408|p231|I should think so, too.
p231_434|p231|But it can be done.
p231_352|p231|So what happens next?
p231_346|p231|We are encouraged by the news.
p231_420|p231|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p231_226|p231|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p231_232|p231|She died in middle age.
p231_018|p231|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p231_024|p231|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p231_030|p231|That deal is a joke.
p231_008|p231|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p231_034|p231|That means an extra two years.
p231_020|p231|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p231_236|p231|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p231_222|p231|That you can do it.
p231_418|p231|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p231_424|p231|The road was closed for several hours.
p231_342|p231|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p231_430|p231|It was a breathtaking moment.
p231_381|p231|Had this been common practice?
p231_395|p231|A review is under way.
p231_168|p231|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p231_140|p231|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p231_154|p231|A new school will be built.
p231_183|p231|The shooting created panic in the street.
p231_197|p231|I suggest a new plan.
p231_196|p231|I came home by ambulance.
p231_155|p231|The strong pound also took its toll.
p231_141|p231|I miss the freedom that I had.
p231_169|p231|It is really good news.
p231_394|p231|That's as good as it gets.
p231_380|p231|We will win the argument.
p231_357|p231|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p231_431|p231|I was in jail for five years.
p231_343|p231|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p231_419|p231|The case will now go to appeal.
p231_223|p231|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p231_237|p231|Hospitals are for the ill.
p231_021|p231|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p231_035|p231|I became a widow overnight.
p231_009|p231|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p231_023|p231|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p231_037|p231|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p231_209|p231|We are a new department.
p231_221|p231|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p231_235|p231|The irony was not lost.
p231_369|p231|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p231_433|p231|It is based on a true story.
p231_355|p231|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p231_341|p231|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p231_427|p231|I would love to think that she could win.
p231_396|p231|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p231_382|p231|What do they want us to do?
p231_157|p231|He was right into football from an early age.
p231_143|p231|Anyone can do the sums.
p231_194|p231|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p231_180|p231|I have spoken to head office.
p231_181|p231|I am not ready to walk away.
p231_195|p231|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p231_142|p231|It only increased the support for him.
p231_156|p231|It is a terrible tragedy.
p231_383|p231|Is it worth it?
p231_397|p231|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p231_340|p231|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p231_426|p231|My aim is a top six finish.
p231_432|p231|I never had a childhood.
p231_354|p231|Neither man has been charged.
p231_368|p231|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
p231_234|p231|It is set in Paris.
p231_220|p231|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p231_208|p231|I won't make an official complaint.
p231_036|p231|But he can turn on the charm.
p231_045|p231|I guess I was lucky, though.
p231_051|p231|We keep an eye on it.
p231_079|p231|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p231_086|p231|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p231_092|p231|Their attitude is all wrong.
p231_247|p231|Persuaded to change his mind.
p231_253|p231|It was a cry for help.
p231_284|p231|Blair also had a penalty.
p231_290|p231|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p231_333|p231|However, the groups denied the claims.
p231_327|p231|The king is delighted by the honour.
p231_441|p231|We shall not forget him.
p231_469|p231|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p231_131|p231|They made such decisions in London.
p231_125|p231|That period was a struggle.
p231_119|p231|It is a delight on every level.
p231_118|p231|Then again, we could have.
p231_124|p231|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p231_130|p231|It plans to return to this field.
p231_468|p231|War is not the action.
p231_326|p231|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p231_440|p231|They said they were only young men.
p231_454|p231|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p231_332|p231|In the old days, it was easy.
p231_291|p231|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p231_285|p231|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p231_252|p231|But they were never expected to last.
p231_246|p231|His is a global perspective.
p231_093|p231|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p231_087|p231|It is an old family habit.
p231_078|p231|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p231_050|p231|It is a symbolic concert.
p231_044|p231|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p231_052|p231|We have not given up hope.
p231_046|p231|I was inspired by two things.
p231_091|p231|But I know the course.
p231_085|p231|However, it did not end that way.
p231_250|p231|The baby deserves the credit.
p231_244|p231|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p231_278|p231|The joint bid is still on course.
p231_293|p231|This could be a mistake.
p231_442|p231|The people are the hero.
p231_324|p231|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p231_330|p231|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
p231_456|p231|They have to be met.
p231_318|p231|That meant the search was unlawful.
p231_126|p231|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p231_132|p231|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p231_133|p231|It is a common problem.
p231_127|p231|This should begin in October.
p231_319|p231|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p231_331|p231|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p231_457|p231|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p231_443|p231|They made a huge impression on me.
p231_325|p231|Have a look at this lot.
p231_286|p231|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p231_292|p231|I've lost all confidence.
p231_279|p231|At first I thought I was gone.
p231_245|p231|You can feel at home in China.
p231_251|p231|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p231_090|p231|I saw the whole thing.
p231_047|p231|A win is a win.
p231_053|p231|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p231_057|p231|Four other charges were dropped.
p231_043|p231|He looks like an Afghan.
p231_094|p231|You are like an animal.
p231_080|p231|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p231_269|p231|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p231_255|p231|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p231_241|p231|The parties have no contact.
p231_296|p231|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p231_282|p231|That view has not altered.
p231_309|p231|He is still in shock.
p231_447|p231|We've got a good management record.
p231_453|p231|We put our bid in last night.
p231_123|p231|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p231_137|p231|This is a successful outcome.
p231_136|p231|He is a great addition to our team.
p231_122|p231|We should not be surprised.
p231_452|p231|Its future is no longer in question.
p231_334|p231|She is now on the back benches.
p231_320|p231|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p231_446|p231|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p231_308|p231|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p231_283|p231|You get a lot for your money.
p231_297|p231|He will address the nation this evening.
p231_240|p231|It is now the big brother.
p231_254|p231|No production contract is yet in sight.
p231_268|p231|I've had the time of my life.
p231_081|p231|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p231_095|p231|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p231_042|p231|Among them are many criminals.
p231_056|p231|Italy is a beautiful place.
p231_068|p231|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p231_040|p231|Last year, I was pretty bad.
p231_054|p231|She said she was really sorry.
p231_083|p231|They lived for their children.
p231_097|p231|We should recognise others have done a good job.
p231_242|p231|She took them for a term.
p231_256|p231|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p231_281|p231|They can leave at any time.
p231_295|p231|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p231_336|p231|I think it's about time.
p231_450|p231|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p231_444|p231|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p231_322|p231|We want to play at the worlds.
p231_108|p231|Before the game we went for a pint.
p231_134|p231|You're a gambling man.
p231_120|p231|There were no grounds for his action.
p231_121|p231|I was just a child.
p231_135|p231|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p231_109|p231|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p231_445|p231|It sounded like a bomb.
p231_323|p231|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p231_337|p231|The airport was even different.
p231_451|p231|We went straight into the bedroom.
p231_294|p231|Once again, they would be wrong.
p231_280|p231|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p231_257|p231|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p231_243|p231|Nato was not a love affair.
p231_082|p231|It's so hard to shift.
p231_055|p231|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p231_041|p231|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p231_069|p231|We need to increase the membership.
p231_064|p231|It was a lovely experience.
p231_070|p231|This is an exciting new venture.
p231_058|p231|We should be able to cope.
p231_266|p231|Is it in the right place?
p231_272|p231|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p231_299|p231|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p231_474|p231|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p231_312|p231|I thought it was my only chance.
p231_460|p231|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p231_448|p231|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p231_110|p231|You'd better believe it.
p231_104|p231|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p231_138|p231|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p231_139|p231|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
p231_105|p231|So, did she meet him?
p231_111|p231|New Year will be very busy.
p231_449|p231|And we might go back.
p231_307|p231|You are a different people.
p231_461|p231|They were good years for him.
p231_475|p231|It was all in a short period of time.
p231_313|p231|I thought he did very well.
p231_298|p231|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p231_273|p231|I'd never run for them.
p231_267|p231|Did he trip?
p231_059|p231|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p231_071|p231|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p231_065|p231|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p231_073|p231|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p231_067|p231|Only water is currently allowed.
p231_098|p231|We live by the rule of law.
p231_271|p231|I thought he might have been a bit.
p231_265|p231|Do I think about them often?
p231_259|p231|It was the climax of the thing.
p231_463|p231|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p231_305|p231|The judge was really nice.
p231_339|p231|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p231_107|p231|And does it?
p231_113|p231|It proved a good decision.
p231_112|p231|There's still plenty time left.
p231_106|p231|So what is the campaign about?
p231_338|p231|There was no time scale.
p231_310|p231|McNaughton was not so sure.
p231_476|p231|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p231_462|p231|Let that be their memorial.
p231_304|p231|That was the difference between the sides.
p231_258|p231|It seems a shame to leave it.
p231_264|p231|What was the matter for concern?
p231_270|p231|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p231_099|p231|Two of the team became ill.
p231_066|p231|We will pay their bills.
p231_072|p231|Then followed a bout of flu.
p231_076|p231|That would be too easy.
p231_062|p231|Do I have a favourite?
p231_089|p231|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p231_248|p231|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p231_274|p231|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p231_260|p231|The concerns are the same.
p231_328|p231|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p231_300|p231|But it is up again.
p231_466|p231|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p231_472|p231|He felt it was the right time.
p231_314|p231|I'm not making any comment at all.
p231_102|p231|It's not a quick fix.
p231_116|p231|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p231_117|p231|It is much as it has been described.
p231_103|p231|Why do it otherwise?
p231_473|p231|It was clear on Thursday.
p231_315|p231|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p231_301|p231|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p231_467|p231|Classes must be reduced by half.
p231_329|p231|The problems began a long time ago.
p231_261|p231|I can't get a job.
p231_275|p231|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p231_249|p231|This ruling is a farce.
p231_088|p231|He's been hit by it.
p231_063|p231|What do we do?
p231_049|p231|There's nothing we could do about this.
p231_061|p231|So is that it, then?
p231_263|p231|was everything done to save people?
p231_277|p231|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
p231_288|p231|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p231_459|p231|But he has a lifeline.
p231_317|p231|They come to enjoy themselves.
p231_471|p231|Dennis was not so sure.
p231_465|p231|She has now been registered as disabled.
p231_303|p231|I was just so determined.
p231_129|p231|If not, a deal could take many months.
p231_115|p231|January is a bad time of year.
p231_101|p231|That time is not now, however.
p231_100|p231|No, the equipment is extra.
p231_114|p231|Maybe this battle has been.
p231_128|p231|That is far too high.
p231_464|p231|Driving has been the key.
p231_302|p231|It could well be military.
p231_316|p231|We're on our way.
p231_470|p231|It is too early to speculate.
p231_458|p231|She has reached the top of her profession.
p231_289|p231|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p231_276|p231|These figures are truly terrible.
p231_262|p231|And they were being paid?
p231_074|p231|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p231_048|p231|There was no safety net.
p231_007|p231|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p231_013|p231|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p231_205|p231|Who was she?
p231_211|p231|They are looking at flotation.
p231_239|p231|My future is in the marathon.
p231_371|p231|The result is called a patent.
p231_417|p231|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p231_403|p231|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p231_365|p231|Neither woman has been named.
p231_359|p231|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p231_173|p231|I always felt they played for me.
p231_167|p231|It is simply not true.
p231_198|p231|It was a moment of madness.
p231_199|p231|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p231_166|p231|You've been a great audience.
p231_172|p231|My life has been destroyed.
p231_358|p231|I am a lucky man.
p231_402|p231|It is a large number.
p231_364|p231|It is not real life.
p231_370|p231|This is a major championship.
p231_416|p231|There is some light in the tunnel.
p231_238|p231|The minister is the engineer.
p231_210|p231|It was worth a photograph.
p231_012|p231|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p231_006|p231|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p231_010|p231|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p231_004|p231|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p231_038|p231|The man became a reporter.
p231_212|p231|Which isn't a bad idea.
p231_206|p231|It gave no further details.
p231_366|p231|They should take their mobile phones.
p231_400|p231|I had a fortunate war.
p231_414|p231|They are looking for profit.
p231_372|p231|But we finished the show.
p231_428|p231|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p231_399|p231|Clark is back on top form.
p231_164|p231|He was in great spirits.
p231_170|p231|We've made a couple of albums.
p231_158|p231|It is not like us.
p231_159|p231|What happened in that game?
p231_171|p231|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p231_165|p231|We have a budget in March.
p231_398|p231|They have failed to deliver.
p231_429|p231|He is on the wrong side.
p231_415|p231|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p231_373|p231|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p231_367|p231|You need a licence to run a pub.
p231_401|p231|She is in their hands.
p231_207|p231|You've caught a serial killer.
p231_213|p231|We have an election in eight days.
p231_039|p231|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
p231_005|p231|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p231_011|p231|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p231_029|p231|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p231_015|p231|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p231_001|p231|Please call Stella.  
p231_217|p231|He has a lot of skill.
p231_203|p231|What are you no good at?
p231_439|p231|The British government does not want to know.
p231_405|p231|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p231_363|p231|We live on an island.
p231_377|p231|In due course the deal was done.
p231_411|p231|After the match, do you?
p231_388|p231|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p231_149|p231|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p231_161|p231|Was it the wife?
p231_175|p231|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p231_174|p231|One season, they might do well.
p231_160|p231|Are you going to win?
p231_148|p231|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p231_389|p231|That time may never be broken.
p231_376|p231|We were given a break.
p231_404|p231|It is hard to understand.
p231_362|p231|You did not see it.
p231_438|p231|They are not left wing.
p231_202|p231|how do you get it back?
p231_216|p231|I had decided to quit the show.
p231_014|p231|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p231_028|p231|There was a rush of water.
p231_002|p231|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p231_016|p231|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
p231_228|p231|We played them off the pitch.
p231_200|p231|Libya is an easy target.
p231_214|p231|He also presented You Bet!
p231_348|p231|Are they free?
p231_412|p231|I will always remember the horrible images.
p231_374|p231|There is no deal as yet.
p231_360|p231|I've always been a sensitive.
p231_406|p231|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p231_176|p231|This much I can tell you.
p231_162|p231|Why change it?
p231_189|p231|You know the sort of thing.
p231_188|p231|This is the time to use it.
p231_163|p231|What do we want to do that for?
p231_177|p231|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p231_361|p231|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p231_407|p231|There was an element of frustration.
p231_375|p231|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p231_349|p231|What are they for?
p231_215|p231|That might help a bit.
p231_201|p231|Does the name matter?
p231_229|p231|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p231_017|p231|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p231_003|p231|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p238_347|p238|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
p238_421|p238|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p238_409|p238|How are you, sir?
p238_390|p238|It's difficult to put a date on.
p238_384|p238|Do I have a favourite?
p238_151|p238|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p238_145|p238|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
p238_179|p238|You can spend money on housing.
p238_192|p238|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p238_186|p238|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p238_025|p238|Smoking is also very important.
p238_031|p238|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p238_019|p238|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p238_227|p238|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p238_233|p238|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p238_232|p238|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p238_226|p238|I am considered a teenager.
p238_018|p238|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p238_030|p238|Further management changes are planned.
p238_024|p238|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p238_187|p238|This is a frightening development.
p238_193|p238|The squad is too small.
p238_178|p238|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p238_144|p238|All the employees are redundant.
p238_150|p238|It is a vicious circle.
p238_385|p238|What do we do?
p238_391|p238|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p238_408|p238|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p238_346|p238|His third goal was superb.
p238_420|p238|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p238_434|p238|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p238_352|p238|So what is the campaign about?
p238_422|p238|The company declined to comment.
p238_344|p238|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p238_350|p238|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p238_436|p238|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p238_378|p238|It was really quite amazing.
p238_387|p238|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p238_393|p238|You will have seen the adverts.
p238_146|p238|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p238_152|p238|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p238_185|p238|But we could only help a handful of people.
p238_191|p238|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p238_032|p238|The staff are very good.
p238_026|p238|The first appeared to be successful.
p238_230|p238|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
p238_224|p238|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p238_218|p238|We will try to find someone.
p238_219|p238|Bottling is now the core business.
p238_225|p238|That group reported just before Christmas.
p238_231|p238|So I got a blood test.
p238_027|p238|We must convince the citizens.
p238_033|p238|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p238_190|p238|You just have to accept.
p238_184|p238|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p238_147|p238|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p238_392|p238|Those overseas offices were great.
p238_386|p238|Why do it otherwise?
p238_379|p238|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
p238_351|p238|So, did she meet him?
p238_437|p238|We are aiming for early March.
p238_423|p238|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
p238_345|p238|My daughter is an adult.
p238_369|p238|The statement contained no surprises.
p238_341|p238|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p238_427|p238|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p238_433|p238|They are interior designers and architects.
p238_355|p238|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p238_382|p238|He did not say that.
p238_396|p238|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p238_143|p238|But it looks good for next year.
p238_157|p238|The following are the principal provisions.
p238_180|p238|Since then, things have improved.
p238_194|p238|He has had success at every level.
p238_037|p238|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p238_023|p238|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p238_209|p238|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p238_235|p238|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p238_221|p238|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p238_220|p238|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p238_234|p238|There's always the next century.
p238_208|p238|The refund is fully justified.
p238_022|p238|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p238_036|p238|Let there be no doubt about that.
p238_195|p238|This Patton will also return.
p238_181|p238|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
p238_156|p238|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p238_142|p238|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p238_397|p238|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p238_383|p238|So is that it, then?
p238_432|p238|It was like the old days.
p238_354|p238|They're going to open in early summer.
p238_340|p238|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p238_426|p238|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p238_368|p238|We can have no complaints.
p238_418|p238|We have no information on Iraq.
p238_356|p238|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p238_430|p238|We accept the new rules.
p238_424|p238|Got to get my sunglasses.
p238_342|p238|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
p238_395|p238|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p238_381|p238|It was cynical and callous.
p238_168|p238|They almost achieved a draw.
p238_154|p238|They make a selective perception process.
p238_140|p238|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p238_197|p238|His words were not audible.
p238_183|p238|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p238_008|p238|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p238_020|p238|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p238_034|p238|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p238_222|p238|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p238_236|p238|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p238_237|p238|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
p238_223|p238|We were right to be afraid.
p238_035|p238|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p238_021|p238|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p238_009|p238|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p238_182|p238|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p238_196|p238|Tiger is not the norm.
p238_141|p238|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
p238_155|p238|That's what happened against Ayr.
p238_169|p238|I can see it now.
p238_380|p238|It is the voice of the survivors.
p238_394|p238|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p238_425|p238|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p238_343|p238|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
p238_357|p238|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p238_431|p238|We go there with confidence.
p238_419|p238|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p238_330|p238|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p238_456|p238|Now it has doubled in size.
p238_442|p238|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p238_324|p238|Celtic were the losers then.
p238_318|p238|Sadly, it does not end there.
p238_132|p238|Diversions were put in place.
p238_126|p238|What do they want us to do?
p238_046|p238|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
p238_052|p238|He is too weak to move.
p238_085|p238|It is somewhere to be.
p238_091|p238|The result is utterly compelling.
p238_244|p238|Mr Blair had done well.
p238_250|p238|My Dad is a hero.
p238_278|p238|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p238_287|p238|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p238_293|p238|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p238_292|p238|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p238_286|p238|Each case is treated on merit.
p238_279|p238|I came up through the ranks.
p238_251|p238|And they were being paid?
p238_245|p238|I was a lucky man tonight.
p238_090|p238|He thought she was amazing.
p238_084|p238|He's very young and very keen to do well.
p238_053|p238|Does it matter?
p238_047|p238|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p238_127|p238|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p238_133|p238|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
p238_319|p238|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
p238_443|p238|Still, some additions are inspired.
p238_325|p238|Their conclusions were never published.
p238_331|p238|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p238_327|p238|Little is known about them.
p238_441|p238|None of this work is guaranteed.
p238_455|p238|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p238_333|p238|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p238_125|p238|Had this been common practice?
p238_131|p238|This is a sizeable part of our business.
p238_119|p238|What form did that take?
p238_051|p238|And they removed a Borderer.
p238_045|p238|This represents a tough game for us.
p238_079|p238|But the organisers refused to worry.
p238_092|p238|Final proposals will be published in February.
p238_086|p238|We should all be grateful.
p238_253|p238|What was the matter for concern?
p238_247|p238|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p238_290|p238|We've just had it confirmed.
p238_284|p238|This championship is different from the other majors.
p238_285|p238|But I was glad to see these interviews.
p238_291|p238|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p238_246|p238|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p238_252|p238|was everything done to save people?
p238_087|p238|We will pay their bills.
p238_093|p238|He seems to have everything.
p238_078|p238|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p238_044|p238|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
p238_050|p238|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p238_118|p238|It's going to be epic.
p238_130|p238|Potions said he would drive.
p238_124|p238|So what happens next?
p238_454|p238|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p238_332|p238|Which isn't a bad idea.
p238_326|p238|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p238_440|p238|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p238_444|p238|I believe we can handle this okay.
p238_322|p238|And we have the experience.
p238_336|p238|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p238_450|p238|Either way, it's very funny.
p238_108|p238|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p238_120|p238|Are they free?
p238_134|p238|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p238_068|p238|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p238_054|p238|How do you take them away?
p238_040|p238|I remember that day well.
p238_097|p238|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p238_083|p238|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p238_256|p238|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p238_242|p238|It is not normal practice.
p238_295|p238|It has been recorded twice.
p238_281|p238|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p238_280|p238|You've got to be vigilant.
p238_294|p238|We've had great things in the past.
p238_243|p238|It is crucial for both teams.
p238_257|p238|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p238_082|p238|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p238_096|p238|He was at home with his pals.
p238_041|p238|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p238_055|p238|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p238_069|p238|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p238_135|p238|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p238_121|p238|What are they for?
p238_109|p238|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p238_337|p238|Abbey National is an option.
p238_451|p238|It has become a way of life.
p238_445|p238|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
p238_323|p238|The early physical reports were clear.
p238_309|p238|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p238_453|p238|It seemed a logical expansion.
p238_335|p238|He was admitted to hospital.
p238_321|p238|We believe a third party was involved.
p238_447|p238|I stayed away from the defence.
p238_137|p238|I won't make an official complaint.
p238_123|p238|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p238_043|p238|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p238_057|p238|Has the conflict started?
p238_080|p238|We have to keep our clients.
p238_094|p238|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p238_269|p238|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p238_241|p238|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p238_255|p238|Is it in the right place?
p238_282|p238|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p238_296|p238|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p238_297|p238|I'm interested in interesting work.
p238_283|p238|Phase one was a shambles.
p238_254|p238|Do I think about them often?
p238_240|p238|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p238_268|p238|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p238_095|p238|It wasn't possible to relax.
p238_081|p238|We should be able to cope.
p238_056|p238|After the match, do you?
p238_042|p238|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p238_122|p238|Is there a waiting list?
p238_136|p238|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p238_320|p238|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p238_446|p238|Hard cash is needed now.
p238_452|p238|We didn't want any trouble.
p238_334|p238|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
p238_308|p238|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p238_311|p238|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p238_305|p238|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p238_339|p238|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p238_113|p238|Those people must be accountable.
p238_107|p238|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p238_067|p238|Then they scored two goals to win.
p238_073|p238|And then there's the racial hassle.
p238_098|p238|Maybe this battle has been.
p238_265|p238|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p238_271|p238|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
p238_259|p238|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p238_258|p238|This is absolutely not true.
p238_270|p238|It's never great to finish second.
p238_264|p238|It is a terrible tragedy.
p238_099|p238|Then followed a bout of flu.
p238_072|p238|I had relied on him.
p238_066|p238|It's the performance we want.
p238_106|p238|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p238_112|p238|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p238_338|p238|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
p238_304|p238|Who was she?
p238_310|p238|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p238_306|p238|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
p238_460|p238|It is business as usual.
p238_312|p238|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p238_448|p238|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
p238_104|p238|That would be the case with Dundee.
p238_110|p238|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p238_138|p238|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p238_070|p238|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p238_064|p238|He will need that machine.
p238_058|p238|Have I really come to this?
p238_272|p238|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p238_266|p238|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p238_299|p238|What do we want to do that for?
p238_298|p238|They will probably come back.
p238_267|p238|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p238_273|p238|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p238_059|p238|They desperately want some stability.
p238_065|p238|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
p238_071|p238|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p238_139|p238|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p238_111|p238|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p238_105|p238|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
p238_449|p238|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
p238_313|p238|Movie stars are public property.
p238_307|p238|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p238_459|p238|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p238_303|p238|I think, therefore I am?
p238_317|p238|Here the picture is broadly stable.
p238_129|p238|They lived for their children.
p238_101|p238|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
p238_115|p238|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p238_049|p238|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p238_075|p238|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p238_061|p238|We work for the athlete.
p238_277|p238|He is not a pathetic figure.
p238_263|p238|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p238_288|p238|Says the Duke of York.
p238_289|p238|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
p238_262|p238|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p238_276|p238|They could not match it.
p238_060|p238|Well, he is an artist.
p238_074|p238|We felt it was sufficient.
p238_048|p238|Among them are many criminals.
p238_114|p238|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p238_100|p238|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p238_128|p238|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p238_316|p238|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p238_302|p238|What are you not good at?
p238_458|p238|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
p238_328|p238|Margins are also in retreat.
p238_314|p238|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p238_300|p238|Does the name matter?
p238_116|p238|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p238_102|p238|It's very dangerous for markets.
p238_062|p238|He looks like an Afghan.
p238_076|p238|I am relishing the challenge.
p238_089|p238|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p238_248|p238|It would seem a natural progression.
p238_260|p238|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p238_274|p238|He is a right bastard.
p238_275|p238|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p238_261|p238|They should stop the bombing.
p238_249|p238|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p238_088|p238|It was exactly four months away.
p238_077|p238|I have made that offer.
p238_063|p238|Everything else is a bonus.
p238_103|p238|The fans would love it.
p238_117|p238|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p238_301|p238|how do you get it back?
p238_315|p238|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p238_329|p238|Golf is not like that.
p238_414|p238|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p238_372|p238|But the rally was short-lived.
p238_366|p238|We played them off the pitch.
p238_400|p238|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p238_428|p238|Messages have to be reinforced.
p238_399|p238|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p238_170|p238|This is a step backwards.
p238_164|p238|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p238_158|p238|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p238_004|p238|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p238_010|p238|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p238_038|p238|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p238_206|p238|Truth is the child of time.
p238_212|p238|It is time for confession.
p238_213|p238|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p238_207|p238|There was a fine line to tread.
p238_039|p238|And so was a photograph.
p238_011|p238|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p238_005|p238|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p238_159|p238|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p238_165|p238|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p238_171|p238|I've no idea how it works.
p238_398|p238|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
p238_429|p238|Not many people like to do that.
p238_401|p238|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
p238_415|p238|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p238_373|p238|But you never won any games.
p238_403|p238|That remains the unanswered question.
p238_365|p238|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p238_371|p238|We will likely look for new investors.
p238_417|p238|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p238_359|p238|People should make their own decisions.
p238_167|p238|We can't get over it.
p238_173|p238|The festivals will be about having fun.
p238_198|p238|You are a gambling man.
p238_013|p238|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p238_007|p238|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p238_211|p238|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p238_239|p238|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p238_238|p238|Five years later, the deception continued.
p238_204|p238|How independent is that?
p238_006|p238|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p238_012|p238|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p238_199|p238|Did he trip?
p238_172|p238|We continue to hold the shares.
p238_166|p238|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p238_358|p238|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p238_370|p238|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
p238_416|p238|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p238_402|p238|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p238_364|p238|William Hague delighted his party.
p238_360|p238|I saw them last week.
p238_406|p238|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p238_412|p238|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p238_374|p238|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p238_162|p238|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p238_176|p238|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p238_189|p238|This should begin in October.
p238_016|p238|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p238_002|p238|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p238_228|p238|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p238_214|p238|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
p238_200|p238|Does that put pressure on us?
p238_201|p238|Did it work?
p238_215|p238|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p238_229|p238|That view has not altered.
p238_003|p238|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p238_017|p238|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p238_188|p238|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
p238_177|p238|The changes took effect from June.
p238_163|p238|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p238_413|p238|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p238_375|p238|And he goes with it.
p238_361|p238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p238_407|p238|And it had two seats.
p238_349|p238|My father died in childbirth.
p238_439|p238|It is also very valuable.
p238_377|p238|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p238_411|p238|This is a historic occasion.
p238_405|p238|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p238_363|p238|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p238_388|p238|His successor was only appointed last month.
p238_149|p238|And they all have a vote.
p238_175|p238|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p238_161|p238|He was just like a godfather to it.
p238_029|p238|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p238_001|p238|Please call Stella.
p238_015|p238|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p238_203|p238|Is our children learning?
p238_217|p238|I will not take part in Edmonton.
p238_216|p238|It was started almost by accident.
p238_202|p238|Do you think we are a top nation?
p238_014|p238|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p238_028|p238|There was a rush of water.
p238_160|p238|His job was not advertised.
p238_174|p238|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p238_148|p238|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p238_389|p238|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
p238_404|p238|Everything has its place and purpose.
p238_362|p238|It was a good workout.
p238_376|p238|I have little time for analysts.
p238_410|p238|But nothing could be done.
p238_438|p238|We discovered that for ourselves.
p263_129|p263|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p263_471|p263|That should get their attention.
p263_317|p263|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p263_303|p263|John was there already in spirit.
p263_465|p263|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
p263_459|p263|It goes with the job.
p263_263|p263|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p263_277|p263|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p263_288|p263|He has not created a Festival resource.
p263_061|p263|We have to keep our clients.
p263_075|p263|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p263_049|p263|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
p263_048|p263|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p263_074|p263|It is a job creation scheme.
p263_060|p263|Four other charges were dropped.
p263_289|p263|He was also married with two children.
p263_276|p263|That could be in place by next year.
p263_262|p263|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p263_458|p263|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p263_302|p263|I have lost all confidence.
p263_464|p263|We are over the moon.
p263_470|p263|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
p263_316|p263|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p263_128|p263|They've got to account for it.
p263_100|p263|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p263_114|p263|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p263_102|p263|I did not have a bet on myself.
p263_116|p263|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p263_466|p263|They're just a good retailer.
p263_300|p263|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p263_314|p263|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p263_472|p263|It's just a place to open it.
p263_328|p263|They come to enjoy themselves.
p263_274|p263|I can't get a job.
p263_260|p263|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p263_248|p263|We were a load of rubbish.
p263_076|p263|Even the one she loved.
p263_062|p263|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p263_089|p263|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p263_088|p263|A play is a set of actions.
p263_063|p263|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p263_077|p263|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p263_249|p263|He has run a hell of a race.
p263_261|p263|You look like a rugby player.
p263_275|p263|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p263_329|p263|There's still a bit to go.
p263_315|p263|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p263_473|p263|My place is in the kitchen.
p263_467|p263|Tickets will be at a premium.
p263_301|p263|So the Government will be damaged.
p263_117|p263|He was jailed for a year.
p263_103|p263|I saw the whole thing.
p263_107|p263|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p263_113|p263|It should be a great game, though.
p263_339|p263|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p263_305|p263|Are they free?
p263_463|p263|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
p263_311|p263|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p263_259|p263|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p263_271|p263|I didn't see the point.
p263_265|p263|You can feel at home in China.
p263_073|p263|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p263_067|p263|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p263_098|p263|You might not make it.
p263_099|p263|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p263_066|p263|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p263_072|p263|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p263_264|p263|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p263_270|p263|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p263_258|p263|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p263_310|p263|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p263_304|p263|In the end, it was no choice.
p263_462|p263|I saw it didn't work.
p263_338|p263|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p263_112|p263|That all hope is never lost.
p263_106|p263|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p263_138|p263|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p263_110|p263|In the end we made too many errors.
p263_104|p263|A progress report will be published in October.
p263_448|p263|It is not over by any means.
p263_312|p263|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p263_460|p263|It has been a waste of time.
p263_306|p263|What are they for?
p263_266|p263|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
p263_272|p263|It seems a shame to leave it.
p263_299|p263|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p263_058|p263|I've got to provide for my family.
p263_064|p263|I am pleased to be in them.
p263_070|p263|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p263_071|p263|It's all I can do.
p263_065|p263|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p263_059|p263|It was bound to happen.
p263_298|p263|Its body language is all wrong.
p263_273|p263|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p263_267|p263|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
p263_461|p263|The rest of the business is very robust.
p263_307|p263|Is there a waiting list?
p263_313|p263|I have decided to stand down from the list.
p263_449|p263|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
p263_105|p263|The investment will be in the food.
p263_111|p263|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p263_139|p263|The squad is too small.
p263_176|p263|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p263_162|p263|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p263_189|p263|The region is open for business.
p263_374|p263|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p263_412|p263|It looked like a river.
p263_406|p263|We must improve our relations with government.
p263_360|p263|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p263_348|p263|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p263_200|p263|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
p263_214|p263|I came home by ambulance.
p263_228|p263|We can hardly talk about it.
p263_002|p263|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p263_016|p263|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p263_017|p263|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p263_003|p263|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p263_229|p263|It was located on the remote control.
p263_215|p263|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
p263_201|p263|It is a terrible loss.
p263_349|p263|It is the same old story.
p263_407|p263|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p263_361|p263|He was then replaced by Ross.
p263_375|p263|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
p263_413|p263|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p263_188|p263|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p263_163|p263|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p263_177|p263|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p263_161|p263|I have had a good life.
p263_175|p263|Eight months later, he was dead.
p263_149|p263|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p263_363|p263|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
p263_405|p263|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
p263_411|p263|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p263_377|p263|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p263_439|p263|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p263_388|p263|You have to rely on each other.
p263_217|p263|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p263_203|p263|Who was she?
p263_015|p263|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p263_001|p263|Please call Stella.  
p263_029|p263|What do we do?
p263_028|p263|Do I have a favourite?
p263_014|p263|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p263_202|p263|I think, therefore I am?
p263_216|p263|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p263_389|p263|This season has been a nightmare.
p263_438|p263|I can't wait for the season to end.
p263_410|p263|We shall not be moved.
p263_376|p263|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p263_362|p263|That's as it should be.
p263_404|p263|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
p263_148|p263|I never wanted a legal battle.
p263_174|p263|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p263_160|p263|She will do for me.
p263_158|p263|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p263_164|p263|It is crucial for both teams.
p263_170|p263|Neither side can win this war.
p263_428|p263|Together, we can make a difference.
p263_400|p263|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
p263_366|p263|But we welcome this document.
p263_372|p263|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p263_414|p263|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
p263_399|p263|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p263_212|p263|It is hard to tell.
p263_206|p263|Two years later, she was dead.
p263_038|p263|You have to expect this type of thing.
p263_010|p263|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p263_004|p263|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p263_005|p263|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p263_011|p263|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p263_039|p263|No company would want to put their people at risk.
p263_207|p263|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p263_213|p263|He should emerge as the winner.
p263_398|p263|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p263_373|p263|They may yet have the last laugh.
p263_415|p263|It was important to win the singles.
p263_401|p263|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
p263_367|p263|He did a good job.
p263_429|p263|It is that sort of film.
p263_171|p263|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p263_165|p263|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
p263_159|p263|Like the others, he was arrested.
p263_173|p263|It is an attitude of mind.
p263_167|p263|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p263_198|p263|You know the sort of thing.
p263_359|p263|There is a good example in this city.
p263_417|p263|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p263_371|p263|Nobody else was with me.
p263_365|p263|There is a range of employers.
p263_403|p263|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p263_239|p263|It could be to do with the location.
p263_205|p263|And they were being paid?
p263_211|p263|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p263_007|p263|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p263_013|p263|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p263_012|p263|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p263_006|p263|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p263_210|p263|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p263_204|p263|Or was it?
p263_238|p263|We will reform the welfare state.
p263_364|p263|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p263_402|p263|He replied that it was a dilemma.
p263_416|p263|I'm pleased about one thing.
p263_370|p263|The value of the merger is still there.
p263_358|p263|Whether this return was too soon.
p263_199|p263|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p263_166|p263|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
p263_172|p263|These days are long gone.
p263_157|p263|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p263_143|p263|how do you get it back?
p263_194|p263|Says the Duke of York.
p263_180|p263|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p263_355|p263|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p263_433|p263|Which may be the same thing.
p263_427|p263|But we are severely limited in funds.
p263_341|p263|He is married with three children.
p263_369|p263|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p263_396|p263|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p263_382|p263|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p263_221|p263|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p263_235|p263|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p263_209|p263|However, this idea is never developed.
p263_023|p263|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p263_037|p263|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p263_036|p263|Life was like a timetable.
p263_022|p263|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p263_208|p263|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
p263_234|p263|It's just a normal life.
p263_220|p263|They are in the euro.
p263_383|p263|The bank was now involved.
p263_397|p263|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p263_368|p263|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p263_426|p263|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p263_340|p263|She is on a life support machine.
p263_354|p263|How do you take them away?
p263_432|p263|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p263_181|p263|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
p263_195|p263|The shooting created panic in the street.
p263_142|p263|Does the name matter?
p263_156|p263|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p263_140|p263|Why change it?
p263_154|p263|It is the quality of the work that counts.
p263_168|p263|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
p263_183|p263|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p263_197|p263|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p263_342|p263|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p263_424|p263|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
p263_430|p263|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
p263_356|p263|After the match, do you?
p263_418|p263|I had a tie in my hand.
p263_381|p263|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p263_395|p263|I was just happy to get my own goal.
p263_236|p263|People should make their own decisions.
p263_222|p263|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p263_034|p263|The idea is not new.
p263_020|p263|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p263_008|p263|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p263_009|p263|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p263_021|p263|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p263_035|p263|I could not do it.
p263_223|p263|A deadline is still essential.
p263_237|p263|That you can do it.
p263_394|p263|Theatre is not a museum.
p263_380|p263|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p263_419|p263|I can lead by example.
p263_431|p263|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p263_357|p263|The pain was almost too much to bear.
p263_343|p263|It's difficult to predict the future.
p263_425|p263|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p263_196|p263|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p263_182|p263|It's nice to be involved.
p263_169|p263|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p263_155|p263|Check that he is dead.
p263_141|p263|What do we want to do that for?
p263_179|p263|So was the first half.
p263_145|p263|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p263_151|p263|She died at her home.
p263_186|p263|Time is now very short.
p263_192|p263|It makes no influence on the public.
p263_409|p263|The casualties were not named.
p263_421|p263|Today, the story is different.
p263_347|p263|The airport was even different.
p263_353|p263|Does it matter?
p263_435|p263|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p263_384|p263|It was like a weekly wage.
p263_390|p263|I felt the head was very like me.
p263_233|p263|In each case they were a goal down.
p263_227|p263|Abbey National is an option.
p263_019|p263|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p263_031|p263|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p263_025|p263|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p263_024|p263|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p263_030|p263|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
p263_018|p263|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p263_226|p263|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p263_232|p263|I am considered a teenager.
p263_391|p263|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p263_385|p263|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p263_352|p263|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p263_434|p263|It is not a standing army.
p263_420|p263|Such an attack is bizarre.
p263_346|p263|In the old days, it was easy.
p263_408|p263|It was an amazing afternoon.
p263_193|p263|I thought he did very well.
p263_187|p263|Our position remains the same.
p263_150|p263|Next time round, it will be different.
p263_144|p263|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
p263_178|p263|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p263_152|p263|We have seen a copy of the report.
p263_146|p263|Any success would have been an improvement.
p263_191|p263|The championship is different from the other majors.
p263_185|p263|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p263_378|p263|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p263_436|p263|As it turned out it was a triumph.
p263_350|p263|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
p263_344|p263|My body is clearly capable.
p263_422|p263|The Queen Mother is dead.
p263_393|p263|She has a little boy.
p263_387|p263|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p263_218|p263|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p263_224|p263|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p263_230|p263|It is safe in our hands.
p263_026|p263|How are you, sir?
p263_032|p263|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p263_033|p263|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p263_027|p263|So is that it, then?
p263_231|p263|I'm just a regular person.
p263_225|p263|Bombing is the easy option.
p263_219|p263|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p263_386|p263|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p263_392|p263|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p263_345|p263|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
p263_423|p263|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p263_437|p263|We shall not forget him.
p263_351|p263|Overall, we are very pleased.
p263_379|p263|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p263_184|p263|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p263_190|p263|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p263_147|p263|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p263_153|p263|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p263_134|p263|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p263_120|p263|The fire was above the hole.
p263_108|p263|Our preference is to play in midweek.
p263_450|p263|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p263_336|p263|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p263_322|p263|However, a bid was never made.
p263_444|p263|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p263_242|p263|She will attend in July.
p263_256|p263|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
p263_281|p263|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p263_295|p263|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p263_040|p263|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p263_054|p263|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p263_068|p263|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p263_083|p263|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p263_097|p263|Mr Blair should be warned.
p263_096|p263|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
p263_082|p263|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p263_069|p263|It is the only way forward for the club.
p263_055|p263|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p263_041|p263|It could well be the case.
p263_294|p263|It will always be the highlight of my career.
p263_280|p263|They must play for each other.
p263_257|p263|The irony was not lost.
p263_243|p263|The body follows the mind.
p263_323|p263|We're not an employment agency.
p263_445|p263|No, because it was too many.
p263_451|p263|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p263_337|p263|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p263_109|p263|You are like an animal.
p263_121|p263|Pupils will be the losers.
p263_135|p263|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p263_123|p263|Such actions are rarely popular.
p263_137|p263|It is just a tax on employment.
p263_447|p263|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
p263_321|p263|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
p263_335|p263|He will go a long way.
p263_453|p263|It looked like a war zone.
p263_309|p263|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p263_255|p263|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p263_241|p263|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p263_269|p263|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
p263_296|p263|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p263_282|p263|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p263_057|p263|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p263_043|p263|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p263_094|p263|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p263_080|p263|And does it?
p263_081|p263|Are you from the rugby?
p263_095|p263|It might change your life.
p263_042|p263|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
p263_056|p263|We have not given up hope.
p263_283|p263|They can leave at any time.
p263_297|p263|She failed in her action.
p263_268|p263|My son was too young to die.
p263_254|p263|Does that put pressure on us?
p263_308|p263|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p263_334|p263|There is no plan B.
p263_452|p263|But we have built a platform for next season.
p263_446|p263|He deserves a second chance.
p263_320|p263|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p263_136|p263|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p263_122|p263|The problem was a social problem.
p263_126|p263|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p263_132|p263|I told him I was a long time ago.
p263_318|p263|Nothing has been put into action.
p263_324|p263|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
p263_442|p263|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p263_456|p263|They offer a kind of narrative.
p263_330|p263|We have a good healthy debate.
p263_278|p263|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p263_250|p263|What was the matter for concern?
p263_244|p263|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p263_293|p263|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p263_287|p263|An announcement will follow in due course.
p263_052|p263|He looks like an Afghan.
p263_046|p263|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
p263_091|p263|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p263_085|p263|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p263_084|p263|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
p263_090|p263|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
p263_047|p263|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p263_053|p263|He will need that machine.
p263_286|p263|You get a lot for your money.
p263_292|p263|Access has been a nightmare.
p263_245|p263|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p263_251|p263|Do I think about them often?
p263_279|p263|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p263_457|p263|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
p263_331|p263|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p263_325|p263|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p263_443|p263|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p263_319|p263|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p263_133|p263|They have to come clean.
p263_127|p263|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p263_119|p263|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p263_131|p263|You can spend money on housing.
p263_125|p263|It isn't a happy memory.
p263_469|p263|I just got under the ball a bit.
p263_333|p263|The minister is the engineer.
p263_455|p263|However, one has arrived in the post.
p263_441|p263|You have got to be careful.
p263_327|p263|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p263_247|p263|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p263_253|p263|Did he trip?
p263_284|p263|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
p263_079|p263|So what is the campaign about?
p263_045|p263|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
p263_051|p263|I would love to have him home.
p263_086|p263|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p263_092|p263|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
p263_093|p263|The trick is to try it.
p263_087|p263|The damage from the fire was huge.
p263_050|p263|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p263_044|p263|It will come all right.
p263_078|p263|So, did she meet him?
p263_291|p263|I was first in the door.
p263_285|p263|Much of the equipment was new.
p263_252|p263|Is it in the right place?
p263_246|p263|That will be the criteria for the future.
p263_440|p263|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p263_326|p263|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
p263_332|p263|It is a court case.
p263_454|p263|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
p263_468|p263|It's been a long, long journey.
p263_124|p263|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p263_130|p263|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
p263_118|p263|It was won on the issue of the land.
p297_128|p297|It was my shortest audition.
p297_316|p297|But there was no time for that.
p297_302|p297|I want my audience to be challenged.
p297_262|p297|With us, we just want them to respond.
p297_276|p297|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p297_289|p297|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p297_060|p297|The tribunal continues today.
p297_074|p297|Subtle it is not.
p297_048|p297|What do we do for an encore?
p297_049|p297|Things start to talk to each other.
p297_075|p297|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p297_061|p297|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p297_288|p297|We want to replicate that success.
p297_277|p297|It does not move, which is amazing.
p297_263|p297|But something has been lost in the translation.
p297_303|p297|It was quite a new prescription.
p297_317|p297|He confirmed that there had been no warning.
p297_129|p297|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p297_101|p297|That gives it a spirit.
p297_115|p297|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p297_103|p297|However, what is his calibre?
p297_117|p297|The singer's condition was not specified.
p297_301|p297|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p297_315|p297|The actor has met with Mandela.
p297_329|p297|Off with their heads.
p297_275|p297|How do you find the youngsters?
p297_261|p297|She was charged with perjury.
p297_249|p297|It's like a high school play.
p297_077|p297|Raised the way you want it.
p297_063|p297|Nobody can get at them there.
p297_088|p297|Do something that you haven't done before.
p297_062|p297|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p297_076|p297|I had a tie in my hand.
p297_248|p297|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p297_260|p297|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p297_274|p297|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p297_328|p297|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
p297_314|p297|And he is immensely loyal.
p297_300|p297|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p297_116|p297|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p297_102|p297|It isn't just a defining issue for them.
p297_106|p297|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p297_112|p297|We are just being flooded.
p297_338|p297|That was one very hard game.
p297_304|p297|That, too, was over two years ago.
p297_310|p297|Your father was a good man.
p297_258|p297|The farmers had no choice in the matter.
p297_270|p297|A new school will be built.
p297_264|p297|That's the last thing they need.
p297_072|p297|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
p297_066|p297|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p297_099|p297|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p297_098|p297|My wife and family are the support system.
p297_067|p297|BIG Brother is listening to you.
p297_265|p297|I made a big mistake.
p297_271|p297|Who reminded him about the score?
p297_259|p297|They were assured that it would.
p297_311|p297|Bob Dylan's getting old.
p297_305|p297|Who do you think you are?
p297_339|p297|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p297_113|p297|This ruling is unfair to everyone.
p297_107|p297|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p297_139|p297|It's not a great art.
p297_111|p297|What was it like playing real people?
p297_105|p297|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p297_313|p297|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p297_307|p297|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p297_267|p297|When he came to see me on Monday.
p297_273|p297|I will not walk away from this job.
p297_298|p297|After that, we made some changes.
p297_059|p297|People will see this over time.
p297_065|p297|It's not only my respect for them.
p297_071|p297|They can be time consuming.
p297_070|p297|In the end, however, it all came together.
p297_058|p297|You just have to accept.
p297_299|p297|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p297_272|p297|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p297_266|p297|England against France is always a big game.
p297_306|p297|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p297_312|p297|Our number one goal is prevention.
p297_104|p297|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p297_110|p297|A great deal has been achieved.
p297_138|p297|It was better than a soap opera.
p297_177|p297|I couldn't honestly tell you.
p297_163|p297|We meet again in Berlin.
p297_188|p297|I let go the telephone and ran.
p297_375|p297|This is the same old story.
p297_413|p297|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p297_407|p297|One policeman was killed.
p297_361|p297|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p297_349|p297|It was all too little, too late.
p297_201|p297|I think it will make a huge difference.
p297_215|p297|This club have been fair to me.
p297_229|p297|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p297_003|p297|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p297_017|p297|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p297_016|p297|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p297_002|p297|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p297_228|p297|I will let you in on a secret.
p297_200|p297|They tend to be female and retired.
p297_348|p297|Surely it can do better than that?
p297_406|p297|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p297_360|p297|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p297_374|p297|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p297_412|p297|However, it was well worth the wait.
p297_189|p297|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p297_162|p297|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p297_176|p297|It was like the old days.
p297_160|p297|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p297_174|p297|But what lies ahead?
p297_148|p297|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p297_362|p297|He had lost his confidence again.
p297_404|p297|I played really well on the back nine.
p297_410|p297|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p297_376|p297|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p297_389|p297|I hope the voters will respond.
p297_216|p297|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p297_202|p297|We have a high quality product.
p297_014|p297|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p297_028|p297|Appointments should be made on merit.
p297_029|p297|I feel strongly about it.
p297_001|p297|Please call Stella.
p297_015|p297|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p297_203|p297|The home team also had their moments.
p297_217|p297|Access has been a nightmare.
p297_388|p297|We have big ideas.
p297_411|p297|You have to rely on each other.
p297_377|p297|All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
p297_363|p297|So, where do we go from here?
p297_405|p297|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p297_149|p297|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p297_175|p297|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p297_161|p297|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p297_159|p297|The captaincy will help that, too.
p297_165|p297|Don't get me wrong.
p297_171|p297|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p297_401|p297|But every country has its own character.
p297_367|p297|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p297_373|p297|It's like English in its underwear.
p297_415|p297|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p297_398|p297|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p297_213|p297|The boys are very confident.
p297_207|p297|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p297_039|p297|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p297_011|p297|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p297_005|p297|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p297_004|p297|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p297_010|p297|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p297_038|p297|You have caught a serial killer.
p297_206|p297|From day one, we were a family.
p297_212|p297|THE atmosphere was electric.
p297_399|p297|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p297_372|p297|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p297_414|p297|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p297_400|p297|She now lives in London.
p297_366|p297|I think we'll just keep it.
p297_170|p297|Which is worse?
p297_164|p297|It's always the same, isn't it?
p297_158|p297|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p297_172|p297|I'm not talking about his career.
p297_166|p297|He died from multiple injuries.
p297_199|p297|Any error is severely punished.
p297_358|p297|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p297_416|p297|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p297_370|p297|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p297_364|p297|I was never alone with her, right?
p297_402|p297|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p297_238|p297|He's a sort of mystery figure.
p297_204|p297|I have played well the past two days.
p297_210|p297|He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p297_006|p297|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p297_012|p297|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p297_013|p297|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p297_007|p297|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p297_211|p297|That's hard for a woman.
p297_205|p297|He has not created a Festival resource.
p297_239|p297|Europe is not a threat to Britain.
p297_365|p297|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p297_403|p297|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
p297_417|p297|This is his personal life.
p297_371|p297|What has changed?
p297_359|p297|It's easy to see why.
p297_198|p297|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p297_167|p297|They would never let him go.
p297_173|p297|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p297_156|p297|My son was too young to die.
p297_142|p297|Nato was not a love affair.
p297_195|p297|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p297_181|p297|I wish him well.
p297_354|p297|Gilbert was not amused.
p297_340|p297|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p297_368|p297|It has proved a double whammy.
p297_397|p297|We have understood the problems for some time.
p297_383|p297|And it's time for new leadership.
p297_220|p297|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p297_234|p297|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p297_208|p297|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p297_036|p297|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p297_037|p297|My fitness was very poor.
p297_023|p297|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p297_209|p297|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p297_235|p297|Some were close to tears.
p297_221|p297|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p297_382|p297|I don't want a burial service.
p297_396|p297|It's not a party, no, no.
p297_369|p297|We make good weapons.
p297_341|p297|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p297_355|p297|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p297_180|p297|We are committed to urgent action.
p297_194|p297|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p297_143|p297|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p297_157|p297|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p297_141|p297|It is easy to agree with him.
p297_155|p297|They said we were out of touch.
p297_169|p297|I'm going to buy a car.
p297_182|p297|Others may be trying to catch up.
p297_196|p297|I was just doing my job.
p297_343|p297|The girls are ready to compete.
p297_357|p297|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p297_419|p297|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p297_380|p297|You need a licence to run a pub.
p297_394|p297|I ran to get out of the way.
p297_237|p297|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p297_223|p297|She failed in her action.
p297_035|p297|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p297_021|p297|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p297_009|p297|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p297_008|p297|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p297_020|p297|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p297_034|p297|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p297_222|p297|There has been no reaction from them.
p297_236|p297|I saw it at a ruck.
p297_395|p297|It was to be published next month.
p297_381|p297|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p297_418|p297|Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
p297_356|p297|The course record was in his name.
p297_342|p297|Don't hold your breath.
p297_424|p297|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p297_197|p297|Blood samples were taken.
p297_183|p297|I read it every year.
p297_168|p297|That could be in place by next year.
p297_154|p297|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p297_140|p297|She took them for a term.
p297_178|p297|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p297_144|p297|It's my nature.
p297_150|p297|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p297_187|p297|I'll tell you honestly.
p297_193|p297|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p297_408|p297|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p297_420|p297|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p297_346|p297|It was blown out of proportion.
p297_352|p297|It is only one night, after all.
p297_385|p297|One might think that is a power.
p297_391|p297|I believe that gap is nearly there.
p297_232|p297|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p297_226|p297|The group will report back in the summer.
p297_018|p297|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p297_030|p297|Tommy is not a problem.
p297_024|p297|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p297_025|p297|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p297_031|p297|I started on fire a couple of times.
p297_019|p297|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p297_227|p297|She looked so young.
p297_233|p297|We need a visionary producer.
p297_390|p297|And who would argue with that?
p297_384|p297|I'm not sure.
p297_353|p297|The professor said the results were positive.
p297_421|p297|It'`	s the tip of the iceberg.
p297_347|p297|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p297_409|p297|My heart is not so sure.
p297_192|p297|We've never seen so many.
p297_186|p297|Some may end up in hospital.
p297_151|p297|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p297_145|p297|He was shocked by what he saw.
p297_179|p297|The first time you read a play.
p297_153|p297|That's my big challenge.
p297_147|p297|We had a really good experience with David.
p297_190|p297|There's not much money in cycling.
p297_184|p297|I think we've got the balance right.
p297_379|p297|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p297_351|p297|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p297_345|p297|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p297_423|p297|There was a substantial explosion.
p297_392|p297|This is the real thing now.
p297_386|p297|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p297_219|p297|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p297_225|p297|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p297_231|p297|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p297_027|p297|And the art of performance is taking risks.
p297_033|p297|Other forces were, however, at work.
p297_032|p297|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
p297_026|p297|We have gone on about him no end.
p297_230|p297|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p297_224|p297|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p297_218|p297|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p297_387|p297|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p297_393|p297|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p297_344|p297|O, Is there anything in the wound?
p297_422|p297|It's a true story.
p297_350|p297|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p297_378|p297|They finished second and third.
p297_185|p297|There is no guarantee.
p297_191|p297|Public safety is paramount.
p297_146|p297|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p297_152|p297|I will go out with him any time.
p297_135|p297|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p297_121|p297|The General Election is all to play for.
p297_109|p297|You need insurance to bring people in.
p297_337|p297|You are going to take away my life.
p297_323|p297|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p297_243|p297|But they didn't much like that.
p297_257|p297|This is his first movie.
p297_280|p297|It may have been a cry for help.
p297_294|p297|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p297_041|p297|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p297_055|p297|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p297_069|p297|This is a very high price.
p297_082|p297|Things were so intense in the studio.
p297_096|p297|However, their reaction could not have been more different.
p297_097|p297|I was doing well at the hustings.
p297_083|p297|Its first awards will do just that.
p297_068|p297|We will be paying agency rates.
p297_054|p297|January is a bad time of year.
p297_040|p297|I am writing a novel.
p297_295|p297|That idea is rubbish.
p297_281|p297|There were no passengers on board.
p297_256|p297|However, we had no failures in our side.
p297_242|p297|Dialogue is the key.
p297_322|p297|I was pregnant and very worried.
p297_336|p297|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p297_108|p297|She died in middle age.
p297_120|p297|Our lives have been turned upside down.
p297_134|p297|What did they think of her voice?
p297_122|p297|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p297_136|p297|We were extremely poor.
p297_320|p297|There are different cultures in different departments.
p297_334|p297|There is no smoking gun.
p297_308|p297|I can understand why they have gone.
p297_254|p297|Who did the recruiting?
p297_240|p297|He just wants to leave a legacy.
p297_268|p297|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p297_297|p297|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p297_283|p297|This is wrong, but that's believed.
p297_056|p297|That is an important part of our role.
p297_042|p297|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p297_095|p297|There is no such thing.
p297_081|p297|You have to do your research.
p297_080|p297|We were short of athletes.
p297_094|p297|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p297_043|p297|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p297_057|p297|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p297_282|p297|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p297_296|p297|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p297_269|p297|The criteria have changed.
p297_241|p297|Every game against New Zealand is.
p297_255|p297|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p297_309|p297|They will give it a couple of years.
p297_335|p297|His primary residence is Scotland.
p297_321|p297|He was caught and fired.
p297_137|p297|He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
p297_123|p297|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p297_127|p297|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p297_133|p297|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p297_319|p297|The company's in good shape.
p297_325|p297|It's only tackling congestion.
p297_331|p297|They are now out in the cold.
p297_279|p297|Part of England, is not?
p297_251|p297|It's there for people to look at.
p297_245|p297|I am sorry to hear this news.
p297_292|p297|He looked at me before replying.
p297_286|p297|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p297_053|p297|It was located on the remote control.
p297_047|p297|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p297_090|p297|We talk about effective military action.
p297_084|p297|It was the crowning point of my career.
p297_085|p297|You could feel the heat.
p297_091|p297|Craig is a major concern for us.
p297_046|p297|Except for this, it was offside.
p297_052|p297|All will be revealed in due course.
p297_287|p297|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p297_293|p297|But today was the real big one.
p297_244|p297|We just wish they had done so before.
p297_250|p297|That is how it will be judged.
p297_278|p297|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p297_330|p297|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p297_324|p297|I'll never have problems with any football managers.
p297_318|p297|I am not against a further inquiry.
p297_132|p297|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p297_126|p297|Which brings us to the question of money.
p297_118|p297|It's too big a risk to take.
p297_130|p297|It's unsafe for society.
p297_124|p297|United were in control without always being dominant.
p297_332|p297|The way ahead is not easy.
p297_326|p297|I came into this world with nothing.
p297_246|p297|However we're capable of beating them.
p297_285|p297|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p297_291|p297|That's a trend which will be encouraged.
p297_078|p297|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p297_044|p297|Bombing is the easy option.
p297_050|p297|At the time, he was a living legend.
p297_087|p297|That's how she wants to remember him.
p297_093|p297|I sincerely hope not.
p297_092|p297|The scientific debate is dead.
p297_086|p297|She is still very poorly.
p297_051|p297|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p297_045|p297|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p297_079|p297|Then he did it twice.
p297_290|p297|Taxation should be simplified.
p297_284|p297|They were not up to the required standard.
p297_247|p297|They chose the latter.
p297_327|p297|You will never replace the child.
p297_333|p297|He intends to appeal the sentences.
p297_125|p297|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p297_131|p297|Three penalties were given.
p297_119|p297|It's an expensive part of their equipment.
p264_431|p264|We cannot ask for them back.
p264_357|p264|Neil knows the score.
p264_343|p264|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p264_425|p264|Those overseas offices were great.
p264_419|p264|We didn't really have to power up.
p264_196|p264|What do they want us to do?
p264_182|p264|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p264_155|p264|The second failed completely.
p264_141|p264|That comes at a cost.
p264_169|p264|I've no idea how it works.
p264_021|p264|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p264_035|p264|This remains the case.
p264_009|p264|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p264_223|p264|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.
p264_237|p264|Have I really come to this?
p264_236|p264|Has the conflict started?
p264_222|p264|The two companies were not for sale.
p264_008|p264|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p264_034|p264|We are opening an inquiry.
p264_020|p264|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p264_168|p264|Everything people said about it was true.
p264_140|p264|He nearly killed my son.
p264_154|p264|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p264_183|p264|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p264_197|p264|Is it worth it?
p264_418|p264|The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.
p264_342|p264|An opera company needs to have its orchestra.
p264_424|p264|Our performance wasn't perfect.
p264_430|p264|Equipment is also a problem.
p264_356|p264|We accept the new rules.
p264_381|p264|People could have a post box in the local post office.
p264_395|p264|We learned two things.
p264_383|p264|This is too much like Scotland.
p264_397|p264|It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.
p264_426|p264|She had black eyes.
p264_340|p264|In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.
p264_354|p264|Both watched her win yesterday.
p264_432|p264|The tie isn't over.
p264_368|p264|We've had some pretty bad times.
p264_181|p264|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.
p264_195|p264|Had this been common practice?
p264_142|p264|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p264_156|p264|It gives a commitment.
p264_036|p264|Certainly, we do as well.
p264_234|p264|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p264_208|p264|Her experience is certainly limited.
p264_209|p264|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p264_221|p264|Britain will be little affected.
p264_235|p264|After the match, do you?
p264_023|p264|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p264_037|p264|It carried a double message.
p264_157|p264|Now it was Britain's turn.
p264_143|p264|I told them during their morning break.
p264_194|p264|So what happens next?
p264_180|p264|I've never had a year like this.
p264_369|p264|That is for white people.
p264_355|p264|Her father had died recently.
p264_433|p264|He doesn't need to hit people.
p264_427|p264|In practice, the economic tests have to be met.
p264_341|p264|This deal is a great boost for the Borders.
p264_396|p264|It has been only average.
p264_382|p264|If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.
p264_386|p264|They want the style of the sound changed a bit.
p264_392|p264|We have done our own tests.
p264_379|p264|He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.
p264_345|p264|I believe they are dead.
p264_423|p264|This man must be helped to keep his arm.
p264_437|p264|Special measures were needed.
p264_351|p264|He is fully fit.
p264_184|p264|She really suffered for her art.
p264_190|p264|The questions came quick and fast.
p264_147|p264|She's been shot.
p264_153|p264|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p264_033|p264|It felt right for me.
p264_027|p264|He does not even trust his own members.
p264_219|p264|It was a piece of art.
p264_231|p264|This is absolutely not true.
p264_224|p264|It was all great training.
p264_230|p264|Many changes are positive changes.
p264_218|p264|Life is still very tough for them.
p264_026|p264|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p264_032|p264|He added that her comments were noted.
p264_152|p264|Did it work?
p264_146|p264|Mr Dewar understood that.
p264_191|p264|We tried four banks.
p264_185|p264|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.
p264_436|p264|It was a hard fight.
p264_350|p264|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
p264_344|p264|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p264_422|p264|We have some options there.
p264_378|p264|John gave up everything to be with me.
p264_393|p264|No, because they look good boys.
p264_387|p264|Young people will always run away.
p264_391|p264|The experts got it wrong.
p264_385|p264|His third child was born in April.
p264_408|p264|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.
p264_352|p264|That would concern me lot.
p264_434|p264|A job is a job, after all.
p264_420|p264|He is very fast all right.
p264_346|p264|We have no information on Iraq.
p264_193|p264|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p264_187|p264|I remember that day well.
p264_178|p264|We just want this session to end.
p264_150|p264|Did he trip?
p264_144|p264|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p264_018|p264|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p264_024|p264|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p264_030|p264|Do not give your details to anyone.
p264_226|p264|No partners would lose their jobs.
p264_232|p264|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p264_233|p264|It was a great evening.
p264_227|p264|I was in daily contact.
p264_031|p264|I feel I did not have enough time.
p264_025|p264|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p264_019|p264|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p264_145|p264|The truth will come out.
p264_151|p264|Does that put pressure on us?
p264_179|p264|You can spend money on housing.
p264_186|p264|She runs like her mother.
p264_192|p264|Is there a waiting list?
p264_421|p264|They could change them tomorrow.
p264_347|p264|We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.
p264_353|p264|It's clearly a budget.
p264_435|p264|It all came good.
p264_409|p264|You took the law into your own hands.
p264_390|p264|It is the same with Barry.
p264_491|p264|This operation will change her life.
p264_485|p264|I believe in theatre.
p264_334|p264|I saw one man vote five times.
p264_452|p264|The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.
p264_446|p264|The three previous winners also came from Scotland.
p264_320|p264|The performance continues to improve.
p264_308|p264|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p264_136|p264|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.
p264_122|p264|That was a great performance by the team.
p264_081|p264|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p264_042|p264|It is a complex deal.
p264_056|p264|So is that it, then?
p264_283|p264|She now lives in London.
p264_297|p264|Autumn will be a real challenge.
p264_240|p264|This is a big game for both of us.
p264_254|p264|For that reason cover should not be given.
p264_268|p264|I may play with two players up, maybe not.
p264_269|p264|Others get through it.
p264_255|p264|He felt too close to head office.
p264_241|p264|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p264_296|p264|Perhaps they were right.
p264_282|p264|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p264_057|p264|Do I have a favourite?
p264_043|p264|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p264_094|p264|What is the wife?
p264_080|p264|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p264_123|p264|It seemed like four hours.
p264_137|p264|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.
p264_309|p264|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p264_447|p264|In the old days, it was easy.
p264_321|p264|We want immediate action.
p264_335|p264|It's quite crucial for me.
p264_453|p264|They finished second and third.
p264_484|p264|That is surely worth a try.
p264_490|p264|We've got good options.
p264_486|p264|The accident seemed so simple.
p264_492|p264|New York is my home.
p264_323|p264|Someone should tell them.
p264_445|p264|It was an outstanding performance.
p264_451|p264|These days are past.
p264_337|p264|The regional government faces key elections next May.
p264_479|p264|We were given a break.
p264_121|p264|All music goes into me.
p264_135|p264|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p264_109|p264|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p264_096|p264|What do we want to do that for?
p264_082|p264|It looks that way.
p264_055|p264|How are you, sir?
p264_041|p264|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p264_069|p264|This is far too high.
p264_294|p264|If so, we want to hear from them.
p264_280|p264|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p264_257|p264|We had a right to expect those days were over.
p264_243|p264|Eight months later, he was dead.
p264_242|p264|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p264_256|p264|We have brought the staff back on board.
p264_281|p264|He will get his chances.
p264_295|p264|She doesn't know the half of it.
p264_068|p264|That is not possible.
p264_040|p264|I am secure in my owns position.
p264_054|p264|All options are available.
p264_083|p264|Now comes the hard part.
p264_097|p264|Does the name matter?
p264_108|p264|I first met him last summer.
p264_134|p264|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p264_120|p264|It came a bit late.
p264_478|p264|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.
p264_450|p264|We are unable to provide support for future issues.
p264_336|p264|This fact is supported by audience research.
p264_322|p264|Our relationship has been very good.
p264_444|p264|The company was set up six years ago.
p264_493|p264|He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.
p264_487|p264|Her father wasn't best pleased.
p264_483|p264|Your bank may offer you a choice of options.
p264_468|p264|He dismissed the action.
p264_440|p264|That approach has passed its sell by date.
p264_326|p264|The change could come as soon as September.
p264_332|p264|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p264_454|p264|He was then replaced by Ross.
p264_118|p264|But I am in practice.
p264_124|p264|The family moved around a lot.
p264_130|p264|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p264_093|p264|Are you going to win?
p264_087|p264|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p264_078|p264|That is very important.
p264_050|p264|The Office is a show about nothing, then.
p264_044|p264|It does not stop here.
p264_291|p264|We must move on.
p264_285|p264|They have the cash and the fire power.
p264_252|p264|The pension levels will remain the same.
p264_246|p264|It is based on population rather than need.
p264_247|p264|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.
p264_253|p264|He is keen to stay in public service.
p264_284|p264|It's not a small step.
p264_290|p264|He died the following year.
p264_045|p264|We're working on it night and day.
p264_051|p264|We were leading by two goals.
p264_079|p264|Only water is currently allowed.
p264_086|p264|Because I was a very physical person.
p264_092|p264|However this weekend it will be different.
p264_131|p264|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p264_125|p264|We beat the Welsh team.
p264_119|p264|Trading is tough at the moment.
p264_333|p264|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p264_455|p264|They thought he was asking the right questions.
p264_441|p264|Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.
p264_327|p264|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p264_469|p264|If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.
p264_482|p264|I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.
p264_494|p264|That means a ban on French products.
p264_480|p264|The first four teams were all inside the previous record.
p264_319|p264|Not one person spoke badly.
p264_457|p264|The truth was rather different.
p264_331|p264|He had played very well.
p264_325|p264|They should try to get tickets.
p264_443|p264|We would deal first with the biggest party.
p264_133|p264|I hope we've reached the bottom now.
p264_127|p264|We have a team to reach the final.
p264_084|p264|Maybe they will see sense.
p264_090|p264|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p264_047|p264|The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.
p264_053|p264|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p264_286|p264|The institute board will take the decision.
p264_292|p264|It's just an area of water.
p264_279|p264|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.
p264_245|p264|I go home only once.
p264_251|p264|I hit you there.
p264_250|p264|We really are a team.
p264_244|p264|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p264_278|p264|I'm interested in interesting work.
p264_293|p264|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.
p264_287|p264|He followed the Italian route.
p264_046|p264|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p264_091|p264|They are a different team at home.
p264_085|p264|We're at home, which is important.
p264_126|p264|An announcement is expected within a few months.
p264_132|p264|This commitment should be built upon.
p264_324|p264|They really had a go at us.
p264_442|p264|WE all watch the same match.
p264_456|p264|It had been accepted.
p264_330|p264|I can't get away from it.
p264_318|p264|I just felt like a dead loss.
p264_481|p264|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p264_495|p264|This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.
p264_315|p264|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p264_473|p264|It's a tough old job to get for your first job.
p264_467|p264|This is a big advantage.
p264_301|p264|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p264_329|p264|We are a husband and wife team.
p264_117|p264|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p264_103|p264|The referee had been right.
p264_088|p264|They're already booked for next year.
p264_063|p264|You could very well be.
p264_077|p264|The time has arrived for a review.
p264_261|p264|Walker declined to put a figure on losses.
p264_275|p264|He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.
p264_249|p264|I did not vote either way.
p264_248|p264|They were game, but not very good.
p264_274|p264|The third has yet to be named.
p264_260|p264|We had a grand view.
p264_076|p264|The deal was done on Wednesday.
p264_062|p264|It happens from time to time.
p264_089|p264|The savings can be dramatic.
p264_102|p264|I feel confident about the outcome.
p264_116|p264|Nothing would now surprise me.
p264_328|p264|He did not say that.
p264_466|p264|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.
p264_300|p264|That was around July, August.
p264_314|p264|Hibs are playing with style now.
p264_472|p264|We showed some spirit against Newcastle.
p264_302|p264|It changed the very language.
p264_464|p264|Scotland needs this award.
p264_470|p264|It is an industry failure.
p264_316|p264|This is extremely positive news.
p264_458|p264|The technology looks excellent.
p264_100|p264|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
p264_114|p264|But they had to be paid for.
p264_128|p264|Eight others have followed.
p264_074|p264|I think with my experience I can help the team.
p264_060|p264|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p264_048|p264|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p264_289|p264|You have made your point.
p264_276|p264|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.
p264_262|p264|They made such decisions in London.
p264_263|p264|The proposal was rejected.
p264_277|p264|People realise we have a job to do.
p264_288|p264|If not, a deal could take many months.
p264_049|p264|I only signed this morning.
p264_061|p264|So, did she meet him?
p264_075|p264|That is really all.
p264_129|p264|These people were my friends.
p264_115|p264|That's the bit that's wrong.
p264_101|p264|Two of our crew were killed.
p264_459|p264|The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.
p264_471|p264|Each year they cut them down a bit.
p264_317|p264|Other teams moved up too.
p264_303|p264|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p264_465|p264|He enjoyed being with his family.
p264_449|p264|The festival runs until Tuesday.
p264_461|p264|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p264_307|p264|It's not a marketing scheme.
p264_313|p264|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.
p264_475|p264|I'm delighted for Andy.
p264_139|p264|He said some things which were better left alone.
p264_105|p264|It would be easy to think so.
p264_059|p264|Why do it otherwise?
p264_071|p264|But I had never been in a theatre.
p264_065|p264|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.
p264_298|p264|Many events are down on numbers.
p264_273|p264|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p264_267|p264|I was totally wrong.
p264_266|p264|Everyone wanted him to win.
p264_272|p264|All films open tomorrow
p264_299|p264|He had served his time.
p264_064|p264|People come to see the Highlands.
p264_070|p264|He has real potential.
p264_058|p264|What do we do?
p264_110|p264|You can maintain regular contact.
p264_104|p264|Jack was always going to win this one.
p264_138|p264|It's very dangerous for markets.
p264_312|p264|They might surprise themselves.
p264_474|p264|I've got to win here to be happy.
p264_460|p264|We have very limited capacity.
p264_306|p264|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p264_448|p264|Powers looks straight ahead.
p264_489|p264|That time may never be broken.
p264_476|p264|Tell us about it.
p264_310|p264|He left pretty quickly.
p264_304|p264|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.
p264_462|p264|They're interested only in profits.
p264_112|p264|This makes up for it.
p264_106|p264|You're quite wrong, he said.
p264_099|p264|What are you not good at?
p264_066|p264|She always put the party first.
p264_072|p264|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.
p264_258|p264|The group's increasing scale will help.
p264_264|p264|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p264_270|p264|I knew him well.
p264_271|p264|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p264_265|p264|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.
p264_259|p264|We were looking for a base.
p264_073|p264|Confidence is as low as it can get.
p264_067|p264|Things have just worked out this way.
p264_098|p264|how do you get it back?
p264_107|p264|I was born for this moment.
p264_113|p264|Firm action must be taken.
p264_305|p264|Only one got through.
p264_463|p264|That does not take much training.
p264_477|p264|The child has denied murder.
p264_311|p264|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p264_339|p264|Time remains to put other candidates forward.
p264_488|p264|Just look at his fashion sense.
p264_389|p264|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p264_410|p264|But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.
p264_376|p264|He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.
p264_362|p264|Her body has never been found.
p264_404|p264|It was that kind of match.
p264_438|p264|However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.
p264_174|p264|Now he's back on top again.
p264_160|p264|It was clearly not a battle.
p264_148|p264|Do I think about them often?
p264_014|p264|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p264_028|p264|We're only taking on a couple just now.
p264_202|p264|I was independent but I am not now.
p264_216|p264|Henry should go now.
p264_217|p264|Now we have fresh hope.
p264_203|p264|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p264_029|p264|The local primary is excellent.
p264_015|p264|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p264_001|p264|Please call Stella.  
p264_149|p264|Is it in the right place?
p264_161|p264|No such meeting took place.
p264_439|p264|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p264_363|p264|The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.
p264_405|p264|Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.
p264_411|p264|They like big name players.
p264_377|p264|It would have to look for outside funding.
p264_388|p264|The view is impressive.
p264_407|p264|So I moved on.
p264_361|p264|It shows we're not much of a rugby country.
p264_375|p264|We have a high quality product.
p264_413|p264|Williams said the same.
p264_349|p264|The book is closed.
p264_188|p264|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.
p264_163|p264|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p264_177|p264|Once again, he refused.
p264_003|p264|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p264_215|p264|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p264_201|p264|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p264_228|p264|He talks too much.
p264_200|p264|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p264_214|p264|Three hit the target.
p264_002|p264|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p264_016|p264|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p264_176|p264|No-one wants to talk about death.
p264_162|p264|It is just too tough.
p264_189|p264|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.
p264_348|p264|It looks at public interest issues.
p264_374|p264|It was exactly four months away.
p264_412|p264|Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.
p264_406|p264|The songs are just so good.
p264_360|p264|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p264_358|p264|He could still be President.
p264_364|p264|They had to have hospital treatment.
p264_402|p264|They have quick front players, but so do we.
p264_416|p264|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p264_370|p264|Neither had any other career.
p264_199|p264|How do you take them away?
p264_166|p264|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p264_172|p264|I'm taking each day as it comes.
p264_012|p264|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p264_006|p264|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p264_238|p264|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p264_210|p264|He suffered severe head injuries.
p264_204|p264|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p264_205|p264|I saw people on fire.
p264_211|p264|He was a home referee.
p264_007|p264|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p264_013|p264|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p264_173|p264|Art can challenge our value system.
p264_167|p264|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p264_198|p264|Does it matter?
p264_417|p264|A report will be issued by March.
p264_371|p264|Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.
p264_365|p264|I would never even consider it.
p264_403|p264|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p264_359|p264|It had been introduced over six years.
p264_398|p264|It was an attitude thing.
p264_429|p264|The people are nice, though.
p264_373|p264|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p264_415|p264|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.
p264_401|p264|He plays only for himself.
p264_367|p264|It has helped focus attention on junior golf.
p264_159|p264|Sport is good for you.
p264_171|p264|It is a large number.
p264_165|p264|It's been my life.
p264_039|p264|I wish I could see it again.
p264_005|p264|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p264_011|p264|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p264_207|p264|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.
p264_213|p264|It was men against boys.
p264_212|p264|Brian was last to join.
p264_206|p264|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p264_010|p264|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p264_004|p264|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p264_038|p264|It was a total surprise.
p264_164|p264|The options seem limited.
p264_170|p264|No, but my wife is.
p264_158|p264|We have come a long way since then.
p264_400|p264|The tickets are on their way.
p264_366|p264|Five local people were injured.
p264_372|p264|I took my chance.
p264_414|p264|I was the sheep.
p264_428|p264|I have to protect them.
p264_399|p264|But it is her picture.
p299_221|p299|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p299_235|p299|I will not be pressured.
p299_209|p299|On that they agree.
p299_396|p299|I'll take what comes along.
p299_382|p299|We believe the squad will stay together.
p299_355|p299|This is normal for him now.
p299_341|p299|We just need the Government to act.
p299_369|p299|The plot is minimal.
p299_194|p299|Is Saddam a threat?
p299_180|p299|It's not in my nature.
p299_157|p299|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p299_143|p299|My aim is a top six finish.
p299_142|p299|Such a city does not exist.
p299_156|p299|I am still very much a director.
p299_181|p299|You see - this business is a good one.
p299_195|p299|We've got a great defensive club.
p299_368|p299|Horses have some sense.
p299_340|p299|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p299_354|p299|Do you mean today?
p299_383|p299|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p299_397|p299|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p299_208|p299|I'm a bit annoyed.
p299_234|p299|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p299_220|p299|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p299_036|p299|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p299_022|p299|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p299_034|p299|This is a totally different order of agreement.
p299_020|p299|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p299_008|p299|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p299_236|p299|I had another good day.
p299_222|p299|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p299_381|p299|I'm getting back up there now.
p299_395|p299|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p299_342|p299|The urgency is real.
p299_356|p299|But my heart is in athletics.
p299_183|p299|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p299_197|p299|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p299_140|p299|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p299_154|p299|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p299_168|p299|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p299_169|p299|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p299_155|p299|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p299_141|p299|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p299_196|p299|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p299_182|p299|Who is he?
p299_357|p299|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p299_343|p299|The criminal justice system does not do that.
p299_394|p299|If there is default.
p299_380|p299|Do what you have to do.
p299_223|p299|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p299_237|p299|I hate the word.
p299_009|p299|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p299_021|p299|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p299_035|p299|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p299_019|p299|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p299_031|p299|It has moved on in the last week.
p299_025|p299|I just went for it over the weekend.
p299_233|p299|I think however, he was having a fit!
p299_227|p299|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p299_384|p299|There is a lot of anger.
p299_390|p299|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p299_347|p299|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p299_353|p299|I am ready for that.
p299_186|p299|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p299_192|p299|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p299_179|p299|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p299_145|p299|This has a number of benefits.
p299_151|p299|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p299_150|p299|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p299_144|p299|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p299_178|p299|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p299_193|p299|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p299_187|p299|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p299_352|p299|I have not been so angry for years.
p299_346|p299|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p299_391|p299|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p299_385|p299|We suspect he was pleased.
p299_226|p299|Bill is a mentor.
p299_232|p299|What makes a house a home?
p299_024|p299|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p299_030|p299|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p299_018|p299|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p299_026|p299|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p299_032|p299|It's easy to see why.
p299_218|p299|We are now up against it.
p299_224|p299|But the row refused to go away.
p299_230|p299|I believe you may be that person.
p299_393|p299|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
p299_387|p299|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p299_378|p299|He has never even been to Ireland.
p299_350|p299|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p299_344|p299|He will never walk the streets again.
p299_191|p299|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p299_185|p299|It was that bad, that low.
p299_152|p299|It was then into overtime.
p299_146|p299|There is too much at stake for that.
p299_147|p299|That is in the very nature of farming.
p299_153|p299|Most of the public are behind me.
p299_184|p299|Our members are concerned about their futures.
p299_190|p299|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p299_345|p299|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p299_351|p299|That's the last thing he will do.
p299_379|p299|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p299_386|p299|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p299_392|p299|It was a sell-out.
p299_231|p299|It was a big day.
p299_225|p299|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p299_219|p299|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p299_033|p299|I am proud of moments like that.
p299_027|p299|It is only one night, after all.
p299_083|p299|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p299_097|p299|He is a man who lives to work.
p299_040|p299|We agreed to disagree.
p299_054|p299|I have been here for only three months.
p299_068|p299|A number of people could not speak English.
p299_281|p299|The whole team was rubbish.
p299_295|p299|I am not a free trader.
p299_242|p299|I was the only one arguing differently.
p299_256|p299|We don't have the credible evidence.
p299_336|p299|The package has been properly costed.
p299_322|p299|Soon the whole country will be level.
p299_134|p299|I love you so very much.
p299_120|p299|You can see their point.
p299_108|p299|He has one son and one daughter.
p299_109|p299|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p299_121|p299|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p299_135|p299|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p299_323|p299|He's very young but he is growing up.
p299_337|p299|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p299_257|p299|It's one up to the Scots.
p299_243|p299|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p299_294|p299|It's a source of deep concern.
p299_280|p299|We need to be looking to the future.
p299_069|p299|They have got off with murder.
p299_055|p299|Everything else is second.
p299_041|p299|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p299_096|p299|We are trying to establish a date.
p299_082|p299|I still feel like a wee boy.
p299_094|p299|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p299_080|p299|She added, It is a huge problem.
p299_057|p299|Sex is fun?
p299_043|p299|I've learned from my mistakes.
p299_296|p299|There were so many characters among them.
p299_282|p299|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p299_255|p299|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p299_241|p299|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p299_269|p299|I hope my successor will do the same.
p299_321|p299|It is a question of balance.
p299_335|p299|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p299_309|p299|I thought he was part of the camera.
p299_123|p299|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p299_137|p299|They can be time consuming.
p299_136|p299|The road was closed for several hours.
p299_122|p299|They married in August last year.
p299_308|p299|We're all in a state of shock.
p299_334|p299|I am not retiring.
p299_320|p299|I think in three dimensions.
p299_268|p299|She is a great talent.
p299_240|p299|I would say so.
p299_254|p299|One of these problems is the railways.
p299_283|p299|Some of the players have not progressed.
p299_297|p299|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p299_042|p299|If you look at the beginning of Alien.
p299_056|p299|I think it is a sensible change.
p299_081|p299|You can't keep them separate.
p299_095|p299|Our offer will remain on the table.
p299_091|p299|There is a growing anger among the group.
p299_085|p299|Israel has done very little until now.
p299_052|p299|That was the problem.
p299_046|p299|That says something for his strength of character.
p299_293|p299|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p299_287|p299|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p299_278|p299|It was a long process, but we got there.
p299_250|p299|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p299_244|p299|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p299_318|p299|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p299_324|p299|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p299_330|p299|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p299_126|p299|There were no casualties.
p299_132|p299|Where is the anthrax?
p299_133|p299|Bombing is the easy option.
p299_127|p299|I've just got to build on this now.
p299_331|p299|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p299_325|p299|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p299_319|p299|It was chaotic and frightening.
p299_245|p299|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p299_251|p299|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
p299_279|p299|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p299_286|p299|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p299_292|p299|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p299_047|p299|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p299_053|p299|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p299_084|p299|But there was a shift.
p299_090|p299|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p299_086|p299|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p299_092|p299|We certainly will need to watch him.
p299_079|p299|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p299_045|p299|It should be a great game, though.
p299_051|p299|Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
p299_284|p299|It is quite an eye opener.
p299_290|p299|Are his works inside out?
p299_247|p299|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p299_253|p299|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p299_333|p299|I have a bunch of veterans.
p299_327|p299|We could not have asked for any more.
p299_119|p299|I am happy with my form.
p299_131|p299|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p299_125|p299|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p299_124|p299|Yet he chose to do something different.
p299_130|p299|They really did a great job.
p299_118|p299|It is crucial for both teams.
p299_326|p299|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p299_332|p299|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p299_252|p299|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p299_246|p299|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p299_291|p299|There is a cup final at stake.
p299_285|p299|You've got it coming Kabul.
p299_050|p299|I've just got to do this.
p299_044|p299|Today is not about contracts.
p299_078|p299|Robert is a special talent.
p299_093|p299|I don't think it could be clearer.
p299_087|p299|We are losing this war.
p299_061|p299|We hope this scheme will change that.
p299_075|p299|It does not stop at the border.
p299_049|p299|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p299_288|p299|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p299_263|p299|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p299_277|p299|Is this new report the answer?
p299_317|p299|I've seen some of the submissions.
p299_303|p299|No decision on that was taken.
p299_115|p299|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p299_101|p299|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p299_129|p299|The case will now go to appeal.
p299_128|p299|I was pleased with my own game.
p299_100|p299|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p299_114|p299|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p299_302|p299|They were the better side on the day.
p299_316|p299|Instead, she just went away.
p299_276|p299|The fans will support us.
p299_262|p299|Also, he was flawed.
p299_289|p299|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p299_048|p299|It's to do with play.
p299_074|p299|The settlement could run to millions.
p299_060|p299|He had played well in that central role.
p299_089|p299|The death rates are still as high.
p299_076|p299|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p299_062|p299|It was created by genocide.
p299_274|p299|We have got a full house tonight.
p299_260|p299|I don't want to use the term.
p299_248|p299|It was a tactical change.
p299_300|p299|The Dow Jones is way up.
p299_314|p299|She was just that sort of person.
p299_328|p299|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p299_102|p299|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p299_116|p299|The next few months will tell.
p299_117|p299|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p299_103|p299|He had a heart problem.
p299_329|p299|People might not actually want the job.
p299_315|p299|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p299_301|p299|Now there's an even bigger target.
p299_249|p299|She had kept the news from him.
p299_261|p299|And we still have to pay his salary.
p299_275|p299|The things writers and directors say!
p299_063|p299|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p299_077|p299|How can they say that?
p299_088|p299|A decision is expected today.
p299_098|p299|The website is now being amended.
p299_073|p299|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p299_067|p299|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p299_259|p299|He is a right bastard.
p299_271|p299|We do things in an appropriate way.
p299_265|p299|I didn't have a trio.
p299_339|p299|Barry will be able to handle this.
p299_305|p299|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p299_311|p299|We are in a learning curve.
p299_107|p299|I am a wealthy person.
p299_113|p299|He had other things on his mind.
p299_112|p299|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p299_106|p299|That was the light relief.
p299_310|p299|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p299_304|p299|What went wrong?
p299_338|p299|We will work through the night.
p299_264|p299|So there's a double whammy.
p299_270|p299|I learned that only yesterday.
p299_258|p299|I'm just doing artwork.
p299_066|p299|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p299_072|p299|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p299_099|p299|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p299_058|p299|They were not doing it too well, either.
p299_064|p299|How could anyone take issue with that?
p299_070|p299|They had had time for little else.
p299_299|p299|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p299_266|p299|Their three other children had died as infants.
p299_272|p299|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p299_312|p299|Why should we have been asked to share?
p299_306|p299|They chose to side with terror.
p299_138|p299|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p299_110|p299|That, he claimed, was essential.
p299_104|p299|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p299_105|p299|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p299_111|p299|I have great respect for all my players.
p299_139|p299|I had a tie in my hand.
p299_307|p299|This must have been severe.
p299_313|p299|He was released in March this year.
p299_273|p299|Are you in this movie?
p299_267|p299|We knew nothing about it.
p299_298|p299|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p299_071|p299|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p299_065|p299|He takes time out for everyone.
p299_059|p299|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p299_002|p299|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p299_016|p299|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p299_200|p299|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p299_214|p299|Here are some possible solutions.
p299_228|p299|This must be really short of ideas.
p299_374|p299|I didn't do too badly myself.
p299_360|p299|The place became a war zone.
p299_348|p299|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p299_189|p299|There was no rescue.
p299_176|p299|My life has been destroyed.
p299_162|p299|They will know they deserve to be there.
p299_163|p299|Of course he is.
p299_177|p299|His signature is his handwriting.
p299_188|p299|It worked, up to a point.
p299_349|p299|I can't stop people thinking.
p299_361|p299|What's happening to her?
p299_375|p299|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p299_229|p299|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p299_215|p299|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p299_201|p299|She told me to apply for the crest.
p299_017|p299|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p299_003|p299|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p299_015|p299|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p299_001|p299|Please call Stella.
p299_029|p299|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
p299_217|p299|He made so many bad decisions.
p299_203|p299|I think the Government should pay for that.
p299_388|p299|She always wanted her own way.
p299_363|p299|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p299_405|p299|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
p299_377|p299|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p299_161|p299|My house was shaking at the time.
p299_175|p299|Promises were not kept.
p299_149|p299|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p299_148|p299|These matters are now behind us.
p299_174|p299|He was as good as his word.
p299_160|p299|Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
p299_376|p299|We have been working together for some years.
p299_362|p299|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p299_404|p299|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p299_389|p299|Maybe, who knows?
p299_202|p299|He explained to his audience.
p299_216|p299|They were both very brave.
p299_028|p299|Gilbert was not amused.
p299_014|p299|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p299_038|p299|This is a big advantage.
p299_010|p299|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p299_004|p299|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p299_212|p299|It is all one-sided.
p299_206|p299|The budget was too low for that.
p299_399|p299|Scotland is losing business.
p299_400|p299|We are working on the two things.
p299_366|p299|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p299_372|p299|But then, that really is the point.
p299_158|p299|But we are severely limited in funds.
p299_164|p299|This is a huge confidence boost.
p299_170|p299|She is a very lucky lady.
p299_171|p299|Was it a foul?
p299_165|p299|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p299_159|p299|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p299_373|p299|One policeman was killed.
p299_401|p299|We only lost the third goal.
p299_367|p299|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p299_398|p299|She will just have wanted her baby.
p299_207|p299|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p299_213|p299|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p299_005|p299|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p299_011|p299|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p299_039|p299|I think we have a very strong case.
p299_007|p299|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p299_013|p299|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p299_239|p299|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p299_205|p299|The actors are confident and polished.
p299_211|p299|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p299_359|p299|Yet he left a few days later.
p299_371|p299|The plane was in flames
p299_365|p299|I don't have a new house.
p299_403|p299|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p299_198|p299|I feel privileged to be here.
p299_173|p299|We've been there for seven years.
p299_167|p299|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p299_166|p299|And does it?
p299_172|p299|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p299_199|p299|I'm not afraid of that.
p299_364|p299|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p299_402|p299|Women reported more depression than men.
p299_370|p299|See it while you can.
p299_358|p299|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p299_210|p299|I just could not cope.
p299_204|p299|I never made any offer to Mark.
p299_238|p299|We should be trying to keep him in.
p299_012|p299|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p299_006|p299|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p252_369|p252|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
p252_341|p252|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p252_355|p252|What form did that take?
p252_194|p252|A child is not a product.
p252_143|p252|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p252_157|p252|He said some things which were better left alone.
p252_037|p252|Instead, we make the ground pay.
p252_023|p252|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p252_209|p252|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p252_235|p252|Britain will be little affected.
p252_221|p252|The labour side had developed in the North area.
p252_220|p252|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p252_234|p252|We know the problems.
p252_208|p252|The role was perfect for Russell.
p252_022|p252|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows. 
p252_036|p252|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
p252_156|p252|Who was she?
p252_142|p252|That shows the impact it had.
p252_195|p252|Which can happen any time.
p252_181|p252|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
p252_354|p252|Any increase always has some effect.
p252_340|p252|If we get the wrong candidate.
p252_368|p252|They made such decisions in London.
p252_397|p252|He has worked hard over the years.
p252_383|p252|I got dropped for that game.
p252_395|p252|There's always a case.
p252_381|p252|An appeal was unlikely.
p252_356|p252|Are they free?
p252_342|p252|They will now remain split up.
p252_197|p252|Now he is back on top again.
p252_183|p252|I've no idea how it works.
p252_168|p252|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
p252_154|p252|What are you not good at?
p252_140|p252|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p252_008|p252|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p252_020|p252|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p252_034|p252|I have every confidence.
p252_222|p252|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
p252_236|p252|There is a good reason for this.
p252_237|p252|You know the type.
p252_223|p252|Brian was last to join.
p252_035|p252|He added that her comments were noted.
p252_021|p252|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p252_009|p252|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p252_141|p252|But this wasn't the full picture.
p252_155|p252|I think, therefore I am?
p252_169|p252|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p252_182|p252|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p252_196|p252|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p252_343|p252|We are a husband and wife team.
p252_357|p252|What are they for?
p252_380|p252|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
p252_394|p252|He could still be President.
p252_390|p252|I'm not sure that's right.
p252_384|p252|No real attempt was made to get orders.
p252_353|p252|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
p252_347|p252|Those overseas offices were great.
p252_409|p252|Five local people were injured.
p252_186|p252|Art can challenge our value system.
p252_151|p252|What do we want to do that for?
p252_145|p252|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
p252_179|p252|I knew Donald Dewar.
p252_025|p252|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
p252_019|p252|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p252_227|p252|Her death is a huge blow.
p252_233|p252|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
p252_232|p252|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
p252_226|p252|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p252_018|p252|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p252_030|p252|Schools do not create that.
p252_024|p252|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p252_178|p252|All options are available.
p252_144|p252|I'd always wanted to act.
p252_150|p252|Why change it?
p252_187|p252|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p252_193|p252|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p252_408|p252|They had to have hospital treatment.
p252_346|p252|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p252_352|p252|No sport needs that sort of thing.
p252_385|p252|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p252_391|p252|I've kept him in touch with everything.
p252_387|p252|It's clearly a budget.
p252_393|p252|There's nothing natural left.
p252_344|p252|It was the September weekend after all.
p252_350|p252|I saw one man vote five times.
p252_378|p252|The referee faces a massive job.
p252_185|p252|Maybe this battle had been.
p252_191|p252|She really suffered for her art.
p252_146|p252|That is a big risk at any price.
p252_152|p252|Does the name matter?
p252_032|p252|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p252_026|p252|This would include insurance.
p252_230|p252|The idea is simple.
p252_224|p252|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p252_218|p252|Her experience is certainly limited.
p252_219|p252|We tried four banks.
p252_225|p252|Now the door has opened.
p252_231|p252|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p252_027|p252|It would fit very well with us.
p252_033|p252|Just look at his fashion sense.
p252_153|p252|how do you get it back?
p252_147|p252|I am never fully fit.
p252_190|p252|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p252_184|p252|It is actually building on the existing business.
p252_379|p252|That could be ready within another nine months.
p252_351|p252|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p252_345|p252|He would add value.
p252_392|p252|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p252_386|p252|This year I understood.
p252_322|p252|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p252_336|p252|Do you think we are a top nation?
p252_108|p252|Scotland were on Saturday.
p252_120|p252|No country has a similar training programme.
p252_134|p252|We're currently looking at the level of support.
p252_097|p252|We are already seeing some positive results.
p252_083|p252|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p252_068|p252|People come to see the Highlands.
p252_054|p252|Schools will not want change.
p252_040|p252|He too started on the subs seats.
p252_295|p252|Kenny and I are ready.
p252_281|p252|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p252_256|p252|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
p252_242|p252|When I was training.
p252_243|p252|I did let myself down a bit.
p252_280|p252|They bought the property four years ago.
p252_294|p252|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
p252_041|p252|I'm so happy that she did.
p252_055|p252|I think I'm a bit too young.
p252_069|p252|It would have to be.
p252_082|p252|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick?
p252_096|p252|Now comes the hard part.
p252_135|p252|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p252_121|p252|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p252_109|p252|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
p252_337|p252|Is our children learning?
p252_323|p252|We have clearly become well established.
p252_309|p252|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
p252_335|p252|Did it work?
p252_321|p252|We lost to a poor team.
p252_137|p252|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p252_123|p252|They pointed to the site.
p252_080|p252|What do we do?
p252_094|p252|The car driver died.
p252_043|p252|This operation will change her life.
p252_057|p252|We wish to win, but not at any price.
p252_282|p252|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
p252_296|p252|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p252_269|p252|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p252_241|p252|That's been the difference between the sides.
p252_255|p252|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p252_254|p252|We were leading by two goals.
p252_240|p252|That time is not far away.
p252_268|p252|But the next day she paid for it.
p252_297|p252|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
p252_283|p252|It is a dangerous sport.
p252_056|p252|He was failed by his health authority.
p252_042|p252|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p252_095|p252|It looks that way.
p252_081|p252|Why do it otherwise?
p252_122|p252|Consumers will also benefit.
p252_136|p252|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
p252_320|p252|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p252_334|p252|Does that put pressure on us?
p252_308|p252|We have achieved that.
p252_330|p252|We want immediate action.
p252_324|p252|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p252_132|p252|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p252_126|p252|Gold admitted as much.
p252_085|p252|LET there be light.
p252_091|p252|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p252_046|p252|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p252_052|p252|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
p252_287|p252|They were seriously after him.
p252_293|p252|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p252_244|p252|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p252_250|p252|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
p252_278|p252|Paul never gave up hope.
p252_279|p252|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
p252_251|p252|Perhaps it will happen again.
p252_245|p252|This is absolutely not true.
p252_292|p252|His season started this afternoon.
p252_286|p252|The future might well be green after all.
p252_053|p252|By all accounts he was delighted.
p252_047|p252|That's what set him apart.
p252_090|p252|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p252_084|p252|He has a real potential.
p252_127|p252|It seemed like four hours.
p252_133|p252|Eight others have followed.
p252_319|p252|One finding emerged clearly.
p252_325|p252|Murray plays down return
p252_331|p252|Our relationship has been very good.
p252_327|p252|Not one person spoke badly.
p252_333|p252|But it won't help British farmers.
p252_125|p252|He is at peace with himself.
p252_131|p252|Britain's role was to stop it.
p252_119|p252|Its failure is no surprise.
p252_092|p252|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p252_086|p252|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p252_051|p252|She continued to enjoy sport.
p252_045|p252|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252_079|p252|Do I have a favourite?
p252_290|p252|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
p252_284|p252|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
p252_253|p252|It is based on population rather than need.
p252_247|p252|It was a great evening.
p252_246|p252|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p252_252|p252|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p252_291|p252|I'm interested in interesting work.
p252_078|p252|So is that it, then?
p252_044|p252|Something old something new, as it were.
p252_050|p252|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p252_087|p252|Scotland has great assets.
p252_093|p252|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p252_118|p252|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p252_130|p252|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
p252_124|p252|Tony Blair said as little.
p252_332|p252|Someone should tell them.
p252_326|p252|Other teams moved up too.
p252_303|p252|Tomorrow will be my last.
p252_317|p252|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p252_129|p252|We beat the Welsh team.
p252_101|p252|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
p252_115|p252|No progress has been made.
p252_075|p252|Their time has gone.
p252_061|p252|The fifth was found later.
p252_288|p252|It was a bit like having children.
p252_277|p252|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p252_263|p252|He makes time for everyone.
p252_262|p252|So we kept them waiting.
p252_276|p252|All films open tomorrow
p252_289|p252|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p252_060|p252|Must be prepared to use it.
p252_074|p252|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252_048|p252|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p252_114|p252|So they should be.
p252_100|p252|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p252_128|p252|Evidence must not be held back.
p252_316|p252|Motherwell took them from half chances.
p252_302|p252|So does every industry.
p252_328|p252|We were caught out.
p252_314|p252|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
p252_300|p252|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
p252_116|p252|They need the money.
p252_102|p252|They had three children.
p252_089|p252|It was exactly four months away.
p252_062|p252|For a decade she was proved right.
p252_076|p252|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p252_248|p252|We have several options.
p252_260|p252|My goals have never changed.
p252_274|p252|The long-term trend is equally clear.
p252_275|p252|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p252_077|p252|How are you, sir?
p252_063|p252|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p252_088|p252|That remains the same.
p252_103|p252|Some young girls also came by last night.
p252_117|p252|That is the only way to rate players.
p252_301|p252|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p252_315|p252|The process will start tomorrow.
p252_329|p252|The performance continues to improve.
p252_311|p252|Many events are down on numbers.
p252_305|p252|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
p252_339|p252|Because I think it's there.
p252_113|p252|It gets too much.
p252_098|p252|We're at home, which is important.
p252_067|p252|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252_073|p252|None has ever been found.
p252_265|p252|The proposal was rejected.
p252_271|p252|This was the perfect setting.
p252_258|p252|It was an accident.
p252_270|p252|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
p252_264|p252|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p252_072|p252|That is not possible.
p252_066|p252|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252_099|p252|They prepared some food very quickly.
p252_106|p252|And so it went on.
p252_112|p252|There was no reason.
p252_338|p252|How independent is that?
p252_304|p252|But there's also a love for the songs.
p252_310|p252|Good players have become bad.
p252_306|p252|We must move on.
p252_312|p252|He had served his time.
p252_104|p252|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p252_110|p252|He gets his moment.
p252_138|p252|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p252_064|p252|Our people are ready.
p252_058|p252|I agree with you about this.
p252_299|p252|He followed the Italian route.
p252_266|p252|Look at a computer.
p252_267|p252|He did better then.
p252_273|p252|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p252_298|p252|They have played their part.
p252_059|p252|Or so he thought.
p252_065|p252|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
p252_071|p252|This is a great opportunity for us.
p252_139|p252|It should have its own network.
p252_111|p252|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p252_105|p252|It would be easy to think so.
p252_313|p252|It was a total surprise.
p252_307|p252|It's just an area of water.
p252_348|p252|That was our last chance to do something.
p252_406|p252|Does it matter?
p252_360|p252|They had better be.
p252_374|p252|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
p252_189|p252|I've never had a year like this.
p252_162|p252|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
p252_176|p252|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
p252_016|p252|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p252_002|p252|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p252_228|p252|The global market was about flat.
p252_214|p252|I want a free vote.
p252_200|p252|was everything done to save people?
p252_201|p252|What was the matter for concern?
p252_215|p252|Fine, said the press officer.
p252_229|p252|Three hit the target.
p252_003|p252|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p252_017|p252|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p252_177|p252|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
p252_163|p252|Mr Dewar understood that.
p252_188|p252|London remained the favourite.
p252_375|p252|If you believe in the blue and white.
p252_407|p252|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p252_361|p252|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p252_349|p252|Maybe she is right.
p252_388|p252|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p252_411|p252|I'd like to report a murder.
p252_363|p252|That seems highly unlikely.
p252_405|p252|Is it worth it?
p252_149|p252|Was it the wife?
p252_175|p252|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p252_161|p252|I told them during their morning break.
p252_029|p252|Do not give your details to anyone.
p252_001|p252|Please call Stella.  
p252_015|p252|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p252_203|p252|Is it in the right place?
p252_217|p252|The Boys can speak about little else.
p252_216|p252|The questions came quick and fast.
p252_202|p252|Do I think about them often?
p252_014|p252|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p252_028|p252|He does not even trust his own members.
p252_160|p252|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p252_174|p252|It was clearly not a battle.
p252_148|p252|Are you going to win?
p252_362|p252|He was a great human being.
p252_404|p252|What do they want us to do?
p252_410|p252|All the dead were believed to have been French.
p252_376|p252|We have no information on Iraq.
p252_389|p252|The women are victims here.
p252_399|p252|It was too difficult.
p252_372|p252|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p252_400|p252|We will miss him against Celtic.
p252_366|p252|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p252_170|p252|The second failed completely.
p252_164|p252|Nato has left them with no other option.
p252_158|p252|He nearly killed my son.
p252_004|p252|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p252_010|p252|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p252_038|p252|That time may never be broken.
p252_206|p252|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p252_212|p252|It plans to return to this field.
p252_213|p252|Business will continue as usual.
p252_207|p252|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p252_039|p252|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p252_011|p252|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p252_005|p252|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p252_165|p252|They have shown great character.
p252_171|p252|That apart, though, I feel good.
p252_401|p252|I managed to do that.
p252_367|p252|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
p252_373|p252|This is far too high.
p252_365|p252|Analysts welcomed the news.
p252_403|p252|Had this been common practice?
p252_371|p252|He said legal action could be considered.
p252_359|p252|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p252_198|p252|The hotel was huge.
p252_167|p252|It wasn't a pretty match.
p252_173|p252|Sport is good for you.
p252_013|p252|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p252_007|p252|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p252_211|p252|Their bodies were never found.
p252_205|p252|This should begin in October.
p252_239|p252|The board do not own the company.
p252_238|p252|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p252_204|p252|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p252_210|p252|If not, a deal could take many months.
p252_006|p252|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p252_012|p252|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p252_172|p252|We have come a long way since then.
p252_166|p252|I am secure in my own position.
p252_199|p252|And they were being paid?
p252_358|p252|Is there a waiting list?
p252_370|p252|The whole system is too complex.
p252_364|p252|Still, I am delighted.
p252_402|p252|So what happens next?
p255_329|p255|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p255_301|p255|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p255_315|p255|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p255_249|p255|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p255_275|p255|He was popular.
p255_261|p255|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p255_077|p255|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p255_063|p255|We should have known.
p255_088|p255|However, it did not end that way.
p255_089|p255|They've got to account for it.
p255_062|p255|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p255_076|p255|What has changed?
p255_260|p255|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p255_274|p255|It looks as though he will be right.
p255_248|p255|It has been declared.
p255_314|p255|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p255_300|p255|Graeme was prepared.
p255_328|p255|We agreed to disagree.
p255_116|p255|Does this mean.
p255_102|p255|Scotland were beaten again.
p255_128|p255|The role was perfect for Russell.
p255_114|p255|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p255_100|p255|That time is not now, however.
p255_316|p255|Henman has been warned.
p255_302|p255|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p255_262|p255|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p255_276|p255|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p255_289|p255|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p255_048|p255|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p255_060|p255|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p255_074|p255|I've got the shirt.
p255_075|p255|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p255_061|p255|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p255_049|p255|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p255_288|p255|So I did.
p255_277|p255|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p255_263|p255|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p255_303|p255|Our task is to complete the picture.
p255_317|p255|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p255_101|p255|Oil embargo endorsed.
p255_115|p255|I joined a group.
p255_129|p255|If not, a deal could take many months.
p255_111|p255|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p255_105|p255|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p255_139|p255|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p255_313|p255|I never thought it would take this long.
p255_307|p255|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p255_267|p255|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p255_273|p255|This is a question of Islam.
p255_298|p255|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
p255_065|p255|The end result is precisely the same.
p255_071|p255|Ferguson should take note.
p255_059|p255|Equity declined to comment.
p255_058|p255|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p255_070|p255|Then followed a bout of flu.
p255_064|p255|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p255_299|p255|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p255_272|p255|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p255_266|p255|He can do everything.
p255_306|p255|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p255_312|p255|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p255_138|p255|It's a question of fashion.
p255_104|p255|Further protests are likely.
p255_110|p255|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p255_106|p255|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p255_112|p255|Maybe this battle has been.
p255_304|p255|they fail to engage.
p255_310|p255|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p255_338|p255|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p255_270|p255|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p255_264|p255|I am very angry.
p255_258|p255|I can't get a job.
p255_072|p255|It works for us.
p255_066|p255|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p255_099|p255|Two of the team became ill.
p255_098|p255|I had a ball today.
p255_067|p255|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p255_073|p255|He is now resident in England.
p255_259|p255|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p255_265|p255|They must play for each other.
p255_271|p255|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
p255_339|p255|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p255_311|p255|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p255_305|p255|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p255_113|p255|I'm delighted about that.
p255_107|p255|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p255_148|p255|The idea is simple.
p255_160|p255|Work has started.
p255_174|p255|They will do their own thing.
p255_362|p255|I have got a wife to feed.
p255_376|p255|Colour was at the core of his life.
p255_216|p255|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p255_202|p255|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p255_028|p255|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p255_014|p255|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p255_001|p255|Please call Stella.  
p255_015|p255|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p255_029|p255|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p255_203|p255|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p255_217|p255|I had relied on him.
p255_377|p255|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p255_363|p255|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p255_175|p255|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p255_161|p255|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p255_149|p255|It is like a football team.
p255_177|p255|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p255_163|p255|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p255_188|p255|It is the whole package.
p255_349|p255|That is a break with tradition.
p255_375|p255|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p255_361|p255|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p255_229|p255|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p255_201|p255|I am totally surprised.
p255_215|p255|That is an important part of our role.
p255_003|p255|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p255_017|p255|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p255_016|p255|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p255_002|p255|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p255_214|p255|He knows a lot.
p255_200|p255|It is a farce.
p255_228|p255|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p255_360|p255|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p255_374|p255|Not because they want to sing about something.
p255_348|p255|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p255_189|p255|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p255_162|p255|And sooner than we may think.
p255_176|p255|You had to go and see him.
p255_172|p255|He is keen to stay in public service.
p255_166|p255|Eight months later, he was dead.
p255_199|p255|However, this idea is never developed.
p255_370|p255|They received a reply from their own managers.
p255_364|p255|Not so, it seems.
p255_358|p255|It was fit for royalty.
p255_204|p255|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p255_210|p255|It was worth a photograph.
p255_238|p255|At the time, he was a living legend.
p255_006|p255|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p255_012|p255|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p255_013|p255|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p255_007|p255|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p255_239|p255|It's the same as Glasgow.
p255_211|p255|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p255_205|p255|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p255_359|p255|We are looking for perfection.
p255_365|p255|Tell it like it was?
p255_371|p255|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p255_198|p255|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p255_167|p255|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p255_173|p255|You are not going in blind.
p255_165|p255|I will tell you.
p255_171|p255|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p255_159|p255|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p255_367|p255|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p255_373|p255|It's a long process.
p255_213|p255|We'll have to work hard today.
p255_207|p255|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p255_011|p255|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p255_005|p255|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p255_039|p255|It is a memorial.
p255_038|p255|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p255_004|p255|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p255_010|p255|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p255_206|p255|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p255_212|p255|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p255_372|p255|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p255_366|p255|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p255_158|p255|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p255_170|p255|I lost my head.
p255_164|p255|It is so unfair.
p255_169|p255|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p255_141|p255|We have got to get it right.
p255_155|p255|The weaknesses are few.
p255_182|p255|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p255_196|p255|They are now divorced.
p255_343|p255|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p255_357|p255|We will be homeless.
p255_380|p255|The casualties were not named.
p255_237|p255|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p255_223|p255|The FBI could become involved.
p255_009|p255|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p255_035|p255|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p255_021|p255|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p255_020|p255|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p255_034|p255|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p255_008|p255|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p255_222|p255|It's not ideal.
p255_236|p255|It's like a basketball.
p255_381|p255|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p255_356|p255|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p255_342|p255|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p255_197|p255|I cannot say too much about them.
p255_183|p255|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p255_154|p255|We shall not be moved.
p255_140|p255|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p255_168|p255|We have to move forward.
p255_156|p255|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p255_142|p255|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p255_195|p255|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p255_181|p255|The jury is still out.
p255_368|p255|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p255_354|p255|It benefits the whole family.
p255_340|p255|Look at the witnesses.
p255_208|p255|It's just awful.
p255_220|p255|It's been a good year.
p255_234|p255|Our numbers are small.
p255_022|p255|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p255_036|p255|We do not expect any surplus.
p255_037|p255|Dancing was her life.
p255_023|p255|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p255_235|p255|They are the innocent victims.
p255_221|p255|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p255_209|p255|It's all about money, money, money.
p255_341|p255|Nobody else was with me.
p255_355|p255|It was one in the afternoon.
p255_369|p255|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p255_180|p255|Is Saddam a threat?
p255_194|p255|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p255_143|p255|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p255_157|p255|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p255_153|p255|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p255_147|p255|I was awful.
p255_190|p255|The goals were good.
p255_184|p255|And I saw the light!
p255_351|p255|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p255_345|p255|This is a friendly match?
p255_379|p255|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p255_225|p255|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p255_231|p255|Mental health is a massive issue.
p255_219|p255|His third goal was superb.
p255_027|p255|They should be so lucky.
p255_033|p255|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p255_032|p255|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p255_026|p255|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p255_218|p255|I had decided to quit the show.
p255_230|p255|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p255_224|p255|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p255_378|p255|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p255_344|p255|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p255_350|p255|I kept going for her.
p255_185|p255|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p255_191|p255|There is no point in looking any further.
p255_146|p255|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p255_152|p255|It is not just about pay.
p255_144|p255|Who would be right?
p255_150|p255|It would be a last resort.
p255_178|p255|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p255_187|p255|Tony had arrived.
p255_193|p255|Four policemen were wounded.
p255_346|p255|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p255_352|p255|He's very explosive.
p255_232|p255|We played them off the pitch.
p255_226|p255|His death was a tragic accident.
p255_030|p255|Life was like a timetable.
p255_024|p255|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p255_018|p255|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p255_019|p255|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p255_025|p255|He has not been named.
p255_031|p255|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p255_227|p255|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p255_233|p255|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p255_353|p255|I was in the train station overnight.
p255_347|p255|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p255_192|p255|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p255_186|p255|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p255_179|p255|His team management was protective.
p255_151|p255|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
p255_145|p255|She died at her home.
p255_122|p255|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p255_136|p255|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p255_308|p255|It's certainly different.
p255_320|p255|Referees are easy targets.
p255_334|p255|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p255_268|p255|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p255_254|p255|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p255_240|p255|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p255_297|p255|A new school will be built.
p255_283|p255|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p255_042|p255|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p255_095|p255|It is a delight on every level.
p255_081|p255|We have other options.
p255_080|p255|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p255_094|p255|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p255_043|p255|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p255_057|p255|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p255_282|p255|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p255_296|p255|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p255_241|p255|It is mainstream.
p255_255|p255|His body was never found.
p255_269|p255|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p255_335|p255|They haven't got a hope.
p255_321|p255|There was some merit in that.
p255_309|p255|Is there on his hands?
p255_137|p255|I saw some terrible things.
p255_123|p255|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p255_109|p255|I came to complete.
p255_135|p255|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p255_121|p255|I can't even get into the A team.
p255_337|p255|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p255_323|p255|That's the law of the land.
p255_243|p255|We were awful.
p255_257|p255|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p255_280|p255|One knows the feeling.
p255_294|p255|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p255_069|p255|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p255_041|p255|But it might have done.
p255_055|p255|My mother is a widow.
p255_082|p255|We want to know about the policy.
p255_096|p255|Get to know him.
p255_097|p255|May not have been at fault?
p255_083|p255|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p255_054|p255|That's the truth.
p255_040|p255|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p255_068|p255|There could be a way back.
p255_295|p255|Who can predict?
p255_281|p255|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
p255_256|p255|There's the mix.
p255_242|p255|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p255_322|p255|I came into this world with nothing.
p255_336|p255|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p255_120|p255|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p255_134|p255|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p255_108|p255|He was jailed for a year.
p255_130|p255|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p255_124|p255|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p255_118|p255|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p255_332|p255|I'd like to take the plunge.
p255_326|p255|My view has now completely changed.
p255_246|p255|It is not the message alone.
p255_252|p255|It's only fair.
p255_285|p255|This is a national crisis.
p255_044|p255|I felt really good until Friday.
p255_050|p255|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p255_078|p255|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p255_087|p255|It is a lifeline.
p255_093|p255|If you could find it.
p255_092|p255|We could not get any possession.
p255_086|p255|We do not get that impression now.
p255_079|p255|He is driven.
p255_051|p255|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p255_045|p255|She looked so young.
p255_290|p255|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p255_284|p255|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p255_253|p255|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p255_247|p255|It's quite a line-up!
p255_327|p255|The police have to act to help them.
p255_333|p255|It can be halted.
p255_119|p255|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p255_125|p255|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p255_131|p255|Our intentions are real.
p255_127|p255|It will be too hot.
p255_133|p255|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p255_325|p255|It is a strong case.
p255_331|p255|It is a time bomb.
p255_319|p255|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p255_251|p255|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p255_245|p255|It is set in Paris.
p255_279|p255|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p255_292|p255|These figures are truly awful.
p255_286|p255|The death toll included five children.
p255_053|p255|Because we do not need it.
p255_047|p255|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p255_090|p255|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p255_084|p255|It's never too late.
p255_085|p255|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p255_091|p255|Until you hit the big games.
p255_046|p255|Life is good.
p255_052|p255|It's very odd.
p255_287|p255|My body is clearly capable.
p255_293|p255|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p255_278|p255|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p255_244|p255|They had no children.
p255_250|p255|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p255_318|p255|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p255_330|p255|It could have gone either way.
p255_324|p255|They will be destroyed.
p255_132|p255|It is also well received.
p255_126|p255|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p239_168|p239|I can see it now.
p239_183|p239|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p239_197|p239|You've got to be vigilant.
p239_342|p239|I am considered a teenager.
p239_424|p239|The capital costs are modest.
p239_430|p239|We accept the new rules.
p239_356|p239|So, did she meet him?
p239_418|p239|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p239_381|p239|We have not been approached.
p239_395|p239|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p239_236|p239|My Dad is a hero.
p239_222|p239|There's always the next century.
p239_034|p239|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p239_020|p239|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p239_008|p239|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p239_009|p239|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p239_021|p239|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p239_035|p239|I might well have done so already.
p239_223|p239|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p239_237|p239|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
p239_394|p239|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p239_380|p239|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p239_419|p239|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p239_431|p239|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p239_357|p239|So what is the campaign about?
p239_343|p239|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p239_425|p239|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p239_196|p239|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
p239_182|p239|Do you think we are a top nation?
p239_169|p239|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p239_155|p239|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p239_141|p239|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
p239_157|p239|Before the game we went for a pint.
p239_143|p239|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p239_194|p239|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
p239_180|p239|Does that put pressure on us?
p239_355|p239|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p239_433|p239|He was released after treatment.
p239_427|p239|This idea has been around for four years.
p239_341|p239|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p239_369|p239|They are the innocent victims.
p239_396|p239|This fact is supported by audience research.
p239_382|p239|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
p239_221|p239|I was caught out a little bit.
p239_235|p239|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p239_209|p239|He is a very talented player.
p239_023|p239|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p239_037|p239|He works at the airport.
p239_036|p239|That can cost him a fortune.
p239_022|p239|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p239_208|p239|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p239_234|p239|We will turn the corner.
p239_220|p239|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p239_383|p239|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p239_397|p239|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
p239_368|p239|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p239_426|p239|It certainly feels that way.
p239_340|p239|It will affect their work.
p239_354|p239|Are you going to win?
p239_432|p239|They are interior designers and architects.
p239_181|p239|Did it work?
p239_195|p239|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p239_142|p239|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p239_156|p239|It is a good lifestyle.
p239_152|p239|Since then, things have improved.
p239_146|p239|He was forced to quit.
p239_191|p239|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p239_185|p239|His job was not advertised.
p239_378|p239|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p239_436|p239|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p239_350|p239|Translation - we got it wrong.
p239_344|p239|The FBI could become involved.
p239_422|p239|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p239_393|p239|Do I have a favourite?
p239_387|p239|She asked for the appointment with me.
p239_218|p239|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p239_224|p239|But it's an enjoyable job.
p239_230|p239|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p239_026|p239|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p239_032|p239|That's all I was trying to do today.
p239_033|p239|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p239_027|p239|And so was a photograph.
p239_231|p239|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p239_225|p239|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p239_219|p239|So I got a blood test.
p239_386|p239|Well, that's just a third district.
p239_392|p239|So is that it, then?
p239_345|p239|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p239_423|p239|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p239_437|p239|Things are going to change over the next six months.
p239_351|p239|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p239_379|p239|He did not say that.
p239_184|p239|Structural changes were also required.
p239_190|p239|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p239_147|p239|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p239_153|p239|That's what happened against Ayr.
p239_179|p239|Did he trip?
p239_145|p239|We just have to adapt.
p239_151|p239|Which isn't a bad idea.
p239_186|p239|That was just one night.
p239_192|p239|My father died in childbirth.
p239_409|p239|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p239_421|p239|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p239_347|p239|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p239_353|p239|What happened in that game?
p239_435|p239|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p239_384|p239|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p239_390|p239|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p239_233|p239|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p239_227|p239|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p239_019|p239|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p239_031|p239|There was a rush of water.
p239_025|p239|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p239_024|p239|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p239_030|p239|It is about control of our economy.
p239_018|p239|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p239_226|p239|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p239_232|p239|It would seem a natural progression.
p239_391|p239|How are you, sir?
p239_385|p239|Those overseas offices were great.
p239_352|p239|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p239_434|p239|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
p239_420|p239|I should think so, too.
p239_346|p239|I just felt that I was broken down.
p239_408|p239|It seems a waste of talents.
p239_193|p239|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p239_187|p239|This is a frightening development.
p239_150|p239|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p239_144|p239|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p239_178|p239|Is it in the right place?
p239_123|p239|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p239_137|p239|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p239_447|p239|Hard cash is needed now.
p239_321|p239|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p239_335|p239|From there, they can go anywhere.
p239_453|p239|It seemed a logical expansion.
p239_309|p239|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p239_484|p239|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
p239_490|p239|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
p239_255|p239|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p239_241|p239|These days are long gone.
p239_269|p239|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p239_296|p239|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p239_282|p239|There is no internal damage.
p239_057|p239|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239_043|p239|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
p239_094|p239|But I had never been in a theatre.
p239_080|p239|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p239_081|p239|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p239_095|p239|It was fun, but not a living.
p239_042|p239|Have I really come to this?
p239_056|p239|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p239_283|p239|We've had great things in the past.
p239_297|p239|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p239_268|p239|They made such decisions in London.
p239_240|p239|They should stop the bombing.
p239_254|p239|She replied, It could be.
p239_491|p239|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p239_485|p239|I was there five months ago.
p239_308|p239|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p239_334|p239|Royal Bank declined to comment.
p239_452|p239|We didn't want any trouble.
p239_446|p239|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p239_320|p239|I have been very nervous.
p239_136|p239|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p239_122|p239|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p239_134|p239|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
p239_120|p239|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p239_108|p239|He was a lovely man.
p239_450|p239|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p239_336|p239|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p239_322|p239|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
p239_444|p239|Any error is severely punished.
p239_478|p239|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p239_493|p239|I first met him last summer.
p239_487|p239|It could well be military.
p239_242|p239|And they were being paid?
p239_256|p239|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p239_281|p239|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p239_295|p239|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p239_040|p239|After the match, do you?
p239_054|p239|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p239_068|p239|I'm pleased with the horse.
p239_097|p239|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p239_096|p239|Kenny Miller might come through.
p239_082|p239|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
p239_069|p239|He will need that machine.
p239_055|p239|He is too weak to move.
p239_041|p239|Has the conflict started?
p239_294|p239|I saw them last week.
p239_280|p239|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p239_257|p239|We have a budget in March.
p239_243|p239|was everything done to save people?
p239_486|p239|It happened again, and again, and again.
p239_492|p239|MOVIE stars are public property.
p239_479|p239|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p239_323|p239|I won't make an official complaint.
p239_445|p239|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p239_451|p239|Either way, it's very funny.
p239_337|p239|Twaddle is a case in point.
p239_109|p239|People will have to be patient.
p239_121|p239|The error appeared in a warrant.
p239_135|p239|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p239_119|p239|The Festival is prepared to help.
p239_131|p239|What are they for?
p239_125|p239|They lived for their children.
p239_469|p239|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p239_333|p239|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p239_455|p239|And Michael was just great.
p239_441|p239|The stage was set for a showdown.
p239_327|p239|They make a selective perception process.
p239_496|p239|I can hardly believe it.
p239_482|p239|The death toll included five children.
p239_247|p239|I've learned from my mistakes.
p239_253|p239|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
p239_284|p239|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p239_290|p239|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p239_079|p239|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p239_045|p239|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p239_051|p239|New York is my home.
p239_086|p239|Or so the theory goes.
p239_092|p239|Does it matter?
p239_093|p239|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p239_087|p239|He has really done well.
p239_050|p239|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p239_044|p239|It carried a double message.
p239_078|p239|I haven't got there yet.
p239_291|p239|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p239_285|p239|It has been recorded twice.
p239_252|p239|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p239_246|p239|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p239_483|p239|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p239_497|p239|They haven't been thought through.
p239_440|p239|It is also very valuable.
p239_326|p239|They are looking at a flotation.
p239_332|p239|January is a bad time of year.
p239_454|p239|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p239_468|p239|The money is within the total allocation.
p239_124|p239|He was just a journalist.
p239_130|p239|Are they free?
p239_118|p239|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p239_126|p239|Their season has been consigned to history.
p239_132|p239|Is there a waiting list?
p239_318|p239|The result is utterly compelling.
p239_324|p239|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p239_442|p239|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p239_456|p239|Now it has doubled in size.
p239_330|p239|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p239_481|p239|The rescue package is public money.
p239_495|p239|The whole thing was just unreal.
p239_278|p239|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p239_250|p239|I've come here for the jersey.
p239_244|p239|What was the matter for concern?
p239_293|p239|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
p239_287|p239|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p239_052|p239|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p239_046|p239|But not a penny has been paid.
p239_091|p239|Is it worth it?
p239_085|p239|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p239_084|p239|And it had two seats.
p239_090|p239|What do they want us to do?
p239_047|p239|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p239_053|p239|I remember that day well.
p239_286|p239|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p239_292|p239|They will probably come back.
p239_245|p239|Do I think about them often?
p239_251|p239|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p239_279|p239|Miller was every bit as happy.
p239_494|p239|The songs are just so good.
p239_480|p239|Five years later, the deception continued.
p239_457|p239|It was never a free kick.
p239_331|p239|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p239_325|p239|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p239_443|p239|They should not feel under threat.
p239_319|p239|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p239_133|p239|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p239_127|p239|Diversions were put in place.
p239_102|p239|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
p239_116|p239|I've had it for the exams.
p239_466|p239|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p239_300|p239|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p239_314|p239|how do you get it back?
p239_472|p239|We need a visionary producer.
p239_328|p239|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p239_499|p239|I am not unduly surprised.
p239_274|p239|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p239_260|p239|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
p239_248|p239|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p239_076|p239|The Government does not go far enough.
p239_062|p239|Perhaps we should do the same.
p239_089|p239|Had this been common practice?
p239_088|p239|So what happens next?
p239_063|p239|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p239_077|p239|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p239_249|p239|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
p239_261|p239|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
p239_275|p239|It's going to be very closely watched.
p239_498|p239|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p239_329|p239|He was admitted to hospital.
p239_315|p239|What are you not good at?
p239_473|p239|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p239_467|p239|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
p239_301|p239|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
p239_117|p239|Those people must be accountable.
p239_103|p239|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
p239_115|p239|The partners are looking for answers.
p239_101|p239|It was exactly four months away.
p239_129|p239|What form did that take?
p239_471|p239|There's nothing I can say.
p239_317|p239|Who was she?
p239_303|p239|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p239_465|p239|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p239_459|p239|This is a great opportunity for us.
p239_263|p239|Our position remains the same.
p239_277|p239|They receive a high profile in the media.
p239_288|p239|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p239_061|p239|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p239_075|p239|Let's not be too despondent.
p239_049|p239|We must learn to finish.
p239_048|p239|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p239_074|p239|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p239_060|p239|And they removed a Borderer.
p239_289|p239|This youngster is so exciting!
p239_276|p239|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
p239_262|p239|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
p239_458|p239|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p239_302|p239|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
p239_464|p239|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
p239_470|p239|This does not create any precedent.
p239_316|p239|I think, therefore I am?
p239_128|p239|How independent is that?
p239_100|p239|Sales are falling after years of growth.
p239_114|p239|It is sometimes like that.
p239_138|p239|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p239_110|p239|I can't remember a lot of it.
p239_104|p239|I am so proud of him.
p239_448|p239|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
p239_312|p239|What do we want to do that for?
p239_474|p239|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p239_460|p239|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
p239_306|p239|This will be our new beginning.
p239_266|p239|He is not a pathetic figure.
p239_500|p239|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p239_272|p239|A winter of discontent awaits.
p239_299|p239|Everyone can have their opinion.
p239_058|p239|Among them are many criminals.
p239_064|p239|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p239_070|p239|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
p239_071|p239|Then they scored two goals to win.
p239_065|p239|They desperately want some stability.
p239_059|p239|That's been the difference between the sides.
p239_298|p239|We may need to take some very radical measures.
p239_273|p239|I thought we were fantastic.
p239_267|p239|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p239_501|p239|You are a different people.
p239_461|p239|Inventories are coming under control.
p239_307|p239|They have the cash and the fire power.
p239_313|p239|Does the name matter?
p239_475|p239|I am sorry, but I forgot.
p239_449|p239|Blair also had a penalty.
p239_105|p239|This time, it might be for real.
p239_111|p239|Instead, another depression came in.
p239_139|p239|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
p239_107|p239|There could be a way back.
p239_113|p239|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p239_339|p239|My daughter is an adult.
p239_305|p239|They have played their part.
p239_463|p239|We will provide immediate access.
p239_477|p239|We did something about it.
p239_311|p239|Celtic were the losers then.
p239_488|p239|Holland won by five wickets.
p239_259|p239|We have expanded too quickly.
p239_271|p239|Each case is treated on merit.
p239_503|p239|The world record is suspicious.
p239_265|p239|They could not match it.
p239_073|p239|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p239_067|p239|Everyone could see the joke.
p239_098|p239|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p239_099|p239|We will pay their bills.
p239_066|p239|Everything is possible in football.
p239_072|p239|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p239_502|p239|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p239_264|p239|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p239_270|p239|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p239_258|p239|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p239_489|p239|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
p239_476|p239|Banking stocks were hit hard.
p239_310|p239|Racism has no place in any sport.
p239_304|p239|That should give me a chance.
p239_462|p239|She failed in her action.
p239_338|p239|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p239_112|p239|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p239_106|p239|He will be kept informed.
p239_161|p239|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p239_175|p239|Mr Blair should be warned.
p239_149|p239|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p239_363|p239|The actual increases will be announced next month.
p239_405|p239|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p239_411|p239|You can feel at home in China.
p239_377|p239|Commitment is released on Liberty.
p239_439|p239|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
p239_388|p239|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p239_217|p239|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p239_203|p239|It is all to do with the coaching.
p239_015|p239|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p239_001|p239|Please call Stella.
p239_029|p239|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p239_028|p239|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
p239_014|p239|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p239_202|p239|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p239_216|p239|We had to add value.
p239_389|p239|A new school will be built.
p239_438|p239|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p239_410|p239|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p239_376|p239|It was launched in February last year.
p239_362|p239|Walker plans to return indoors.
p239_404|p239|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p239_148|p239|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p239_174|p239|As if that is an achievement.
p239_160|p239|Nato has left them with no other option.
p239_176|p239|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p239_162|p239|I think the referee was good.
p239_189|p239|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p239_374|p239|That remains the unanswered question.
p239_412|p239|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p239_406|p239|This game is very evenly balanced.
p239_360|p239|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p239_348|p239|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p239_200|p239|It's been a humbling year.
p239_214|p239|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p239_228|p239|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p239_002|p239|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p239_016|p239|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p239_017|p239|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p239_003|p239|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p239_229|p239|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p239_215|p239|That group reported just before Christmas.
p239_201|p239|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p239_349|p239|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p239_407|p239|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p239_361|p239|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p239_375|p239|This should come as no surprise.
p239_413|p239|We have no information on Iraq.
p239_188|p239|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p239_163|p239|I understand the medical concerns.
p239_177|p239|There was a fossil on screen.
p239_173|p239|She is in good spirits.
p239_167|p239|We have reacted well to each other.
p239_198|p239|He said the director had been completely friendly.
p239_359|p239|William Hague delighted his party.
p239_417|p239|The baby deserves the credit.
p239_371|p239|He ended up a headmaster.
p239_365|p239|The scientific debate is dead.
p239_403|p239|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
p239_239|p239|This is absolutely not true.
p239_205|p239|The refund is fully justified.
p239_211|p239|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
p239_007|p239|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p239_013|p239|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p239_012|p239|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p239_006|p239|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p239_210|p239|Bottling is now the core business.
p239_204|p239|There was a fine line to tread.
p239_238|p239|Further details are expected later.
p239_364|p239|The statement contained no surprises.
p239_402|p239|I have received no explanation.
p239_416|p239|You're not getting any goodwill.
p239_370|p239|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p239_358|p239|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p239_199|p239|Tiger is not the norm.
p239_166|p239|They exist in name alone.
p239_172|p239|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p239_158|p239|Our relationship has been very good.
p239_164|p239|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p239_170|p239|There's still plenty time left.
p239_428|p239|Or maybe it's the other way around.
p239_400|p239|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
p239_366|p239|This would include the GM food industry.
p239_372|p239|That took about two years.
p239_414|p239|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p239_399|p239|Both sides have to step back.
p239_212|p239|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p239_206|p239|My wife and family are the support system.
p239_038|p239|How do you take them away?
p239_010|p239|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p239_004|p239|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p239_005|p239|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p239_011|p239|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p239_039|p239|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p239_207|p239|We are now working with full-time on future product.
p239_213|p239|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p239_398|p239|We were beaten by the better team.
p239_373|p239|He is obviously very dangerous.
p239_415|p239|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p239_401|p239|Everything has its place and purpose.
p239_367|p239|But the rally was short-lived.
p239_429|p239|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
p239_171|p239|Those three weeks are totally lost.
p239_165|p239|This was a unique election.
p239_159|p239|It was the climax of the thing.
p230_209|p230|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p230_037|p230|The boy is no longer with us.
p230_023|p230|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p230_143|p230|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p230_157|p230|They will do their own thing.
p230_180|p230|She has left the island.
p230_194|p230|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p230_341|p230|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p230_355|p230|We are encouraged by the news.
p230_369|p230|They have broken the promise.
p230_382|p230|I always knew she was funny.
p230_396|p230|What are they for?
p230_397|p230|Is there a waiting list?
p230_383|p230|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p230_368|p230|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p230_354|p230|You have no chance of planning permission.
p230_340|p230|You may have a short memory.
p230_195|p230|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p230_181|p230|He played it like a veteran.
p230_156|p230|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p230_142|p230|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p230_036|p230|This represents a tough game for us.
p230_208|p230|This will take several weeks.
p230_220|p230|His second was a beauty.
p230_234|p230|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p230_222|p230|Does the name matter?
p230_236|p230|It had so much to do with output.
p230_020|p230|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p230_034|p230|He really is a lovely man.
p230_008|p230|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p230_154|p230|It has to be now.
p230_140|p230|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p230_168|p230|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p230_183|p230|They will run a mile.
p230_356|p230|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
p230_342|p230|In the old days, it was easy.
p230_395|p230|Are they free?
p230_381|p230|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p230_380|p230|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p230_394|p230|I had a fortunate war.
p230_343|p230|There was some merit in that.
p230_357|p230|The professor said the results were positive.
p230_182|p230|I have spoken to head office.
p230_196|p230|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p230_169|p230|On the month the weakness was across the board.
p230_141|p230|It has to be an event.
p230_155|p230|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p230_009|p230|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p230_035|p230|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p230_021|p230|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p230_237|p230|Must have been at the bar.
p230_223|p230|How do you get it back?
p230_227|p230|It was a day for records.
p230_233|p230|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p230_019|p230|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p230_025|p230|It is on the internet.
p230_031|p230|I'm so happy that she did.
p230_179|p230|It makes no influence on the public.
p230_151|p230|These days are long gone.
p230_145|p230|She has gone to the Catholic school.
p230_192|p230|We always felt we could win.
p230_186|p230|He prefers to play for them.
p230_409|p230|It had been on the cards.
p230_353|p230|Even the one she loved.
p230_347|p230|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p230_390|p230|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p230_384|p230|The marshall at the turn was great.
p230_385|p230|If you can get it.
p230_391|p230|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p230_346|p230|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p230_352|p230|I have a moral dilemma.
p230_408|p230|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p230_144|p230|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
p230_150|p230|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p230_178|p230|Tomorrow is a new day.
p230_030|p230|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p230_024|p230|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p230_018|p230|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p230_232|p230|I was not sure whether I had won.
p230_226|p230|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p230_218|p230|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p230_230|p230|That has been the easy part.
p230_224|p230|What are you not good at?
p230_032|p230|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
p230_026|p230|Smoking is also very important.
p230_146|p230|It was by the numbers.
p230_152|p230|I'm afraid to say anything.
p230_185|p230|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p230_191|p230|We represent a wide range of society.
p230_378|p230|We are a Scottish company.
p230_344|p230|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p230_350|p230|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p230_387|p230|There was a substantial explosion.
p230_393|p230|Motion described it as a unique event.
p230_392|p230|Clark is back on top form.
p230_386|p230|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p230_351|p230|He is not very big, either.
p230_345|p230|The airport was even different.
p230_379|p230|We will win the argument.
p230_190|p230|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p230_184|p230|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p230_153|p230|We are still getting over it.
p230_147|p230|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
p230_027|p230|He has the courage of the unaware.
p230_033|p230|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p230_225|p230|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p230_231|p230|Things were so intense in the studio.
p230_219|p230|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p230_242|p230|It is possible to be too good.
p230_295|p230|It's got to come from me.
p230_281|p230|They can leave at any time.
p230_054|p230|We should be able to cope.
p230_040|p230|Well, he is an artist.
p230_068|p230|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p230_097|p230|Two of the team became ill.
p230_083|p230|It might change your life.
p230_120|p230|They are very happy with the new settlement.
p230_134|p230|It was a piece of art.
p230_108|p230|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p230_322|p230|The party lasted all night.
p230_336|p230|Did it work?
p230_337|p230|Do you think we are a top nation?
p230_323|p230|The group is not paying a dividend.
p230_109|p230|Abbey National is an option.
p230_135|p230|I would relish the prospect.
p230_121|p230|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p230_096|p230|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p230_069|p230|It is a job creation scheme.
p230_041|p230|He looks like an Afghan.
p230_055|p230|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p230_280|p230|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p230_243|p230|In many ways, that is as important.
p230_257|p230|Nato was not a love affair.
p230_241|p230|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
p230_255|p230|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p230_269|p230|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
p230_282|p230|And they were being paid?
p230_296|p230|It took a month and a half to film.
p230_043|p230|The big problem is the lack of grass.
p230_057|p230|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p230_080|p230|It's so hard to shift.
p230_094|p230|You are like an animal.
p230_137|p230|These men are a part of India.
p230_123|p230|We did what we had to do.
p230_335|p230|Does that put pressure on us?
p230_321|p230|It is a road of death.
p230_309|p230|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p230_308|p230|His job was not advertised.
p230_334|p230|It was always an option.
p230_122|p230|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p230_095|p230|We intend to change the model.
p230_081|p230|They lived for their children.
p230_056|p230|We will pay their bills.
p230_042|p230|People want to see me on the screen.
p230_297|p230|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p230_283|p230|was everything done to save people?
p230_268|p230|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p230_254|p230|She took them for a term.
p230_240|p230|They need to win a trophy.
p230_278|p230|None of this work is guaranteed.
p230_244|p230|Here is a question for you.
p230_250|p230|We have to compete at our own level.
p230_287|p230|You get a lot for your money.
p230_293|p230|I would rather look at him.
p230_046|p230|If not, he should go home.
p230_052|p230|None has ever been found.
p230_085|p230|However, it did not end that way.
p230_091|p230|The conclusion is the same.
p230_132|p230|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p230_126|p230|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p230_318|p230|They are not left wing.
p230_330|p230|This is a historic occasion.
p230_324|p230|We were on our way.
p230_325|p230|I was as strong as a horse.
p230_331|p230|This ruling is a farce.
p230_319|p230|McNaughton was not so sure.
p230_127|p230|The opposite is the case.
p230_133|p230|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p230_090|p230|I did not have a bet on myself.
p230_084|p230|You are a great player.
p230_053|p230|Four other charges were dropped.
p230_047|p230|I must take a seat.
p230_292|p230|It is a recipe for success.
p230_286|p230|That was a gold medal for certain.
p230_251|p230|They showed a lot of heart.
p230_245|p230|I was just a kid.
p230_279|p230|There is a case to answer.
p230_253|p230|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p230_247|p230|Hospitals are for the ill.
p230_290|p230|The actor has met with Mandela.
p230_284|p230|What was the matter for concern?
p230_079|p230|By then, he was walking on water.
p230_051|p230|I have made that offer.
p230_045|p230|I was inspired by two things.
p230_092|p230|He was prepared for this.
p230_086|p230|We will deal with the refugees.
p230_119|p230|But this time we can have no excuses.
p230_125|p230|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p230_131|p230|She died at her home.
p230_327|p230|We have a good healthy debate.
p230_333|p230|After some discussion they did.
p230_332|p230|I can see their argument.
p230_326|p230|That meant the search was unlawful.
p230_130|p230|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p230_124|p230|She was also very brave.
p230_118|p230|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p230_087|p230|It was not an insult.
p230_093|p230|But I know the course.
p230_044|p230|That was the theory, anyway.
p230_050|p230|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p230_078|p230|This is a true story.
p230_285|p230|Do I think about them often?
p230_291|p230|It was never a free kick.
p230_246|p230|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p230_252|p230|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p230_277|p230|It is also very valuable.
p230_263|p230|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p230_288|p230|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p230_075|p230|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p230_061|p230|But the challenge is in the US.
p230_049|p230|We have to bring in new players.
p230_101|p230|Before the game we went for a pint.
p230_115|p230|I can't even get into the A team.
p230_129|p230|This is a successful outcome.
p230_303|p230|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p230_317|p230|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p230_316|p230|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p230_302|p230|He is at war with his knee.
p230_128|p230|He was a home referee.
p230_114|p230|That admission is not surprising.
p230_100|p230|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p230_048|p230|It was bound to happen.
p230_060|p230|It's not covered by the insurance.
p230_074|p230|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p230_289|p230|In that moment, I was happy.
p230_262|p230|Persuaded to change his mind.
p230_276|p230|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p230_260|p230|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p230_274|p230|We feel very good about it.
p230_248|p230|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p230_062|p230|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p230_076|p230|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
p230_089|p230|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p230_116|p230|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p230_102|p230|This was a good move for me.
p230_314|p230|I can hardly believe it.
p230_300|p230|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p230_328|p230|I would do away with the dress code.
p230_329|p230|We are on a four-year mission.
p230_315|p230|I must do something about it.
p230_103|p230|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p230_117|p230|Which can happen any time.
p230_088|p230|You might not make it.
p230_077|p230|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p230_063|p230|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p230_249|p230|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p230_261|p230|You can feel at home in China.
p230_259|p230|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p230_265|p230|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p230_271|p230|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p230_073|p230|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p230_113|p230|You can spend money on housing.
p230_107|p230|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p230_339|p230|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p230_311|p230|And we can do it.
p230_305|p230|You have to see it like this.
p230_304|p230|I was there five months ago.
p230_310|p230|We have a clean bill of health.
p230_338|p230|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p230_106|p230|It is an impressive record.
p230_112|p230|We have the mental strength.
p230_099|p230|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p230_072|p230|Why do it otherwise?
p230_066|p230|He also received a medal of honour.
p230_270|p230|I was ready for this.
p230_264|p230|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p230_258|p230|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p230_272|p230|They are interior designers and architects.
p230_266|p230|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p230_299|p230|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p230_058|p230|It was exactly four months away.
p230_070|p230|It looks like a hit.
p230_064|p230|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p230_138|p230|I was caught out a little bit.
p230_104|p230|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p230_110|p230|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
p230_306|p230|Rugby is now just like football.
p230_312|p230|The songs are just so good.
p230_313|p230|The casting is as perfect.
p230_307|p230|It could well be military.
p230_105|p230|It is close to call.
p230_139|p230|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p230_065|p230|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p230_071|p230|What do we do?
p230_059|p230|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p230_298|p230|It is a symbolic concert.
p230_267|p230|I should think so, too.
p230_273|p230|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p230_214|p230|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p230_200|p230|We played them off the pitch.
p230_228|p230|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p230_016|p230|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
p230_002|p230|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p230_162|p230|Had I heard?
p230_176|p230|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p230_189|p230|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p230_406|p230|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
p230_360|p230|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p230_374|p230|She is now on the back benches.
p230_348|p230|There was no time scale.
p230_349|p230|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p230_375|p230|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
p230_413|p230|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p230_407|p230|The casualties were not named.
p230_361|p230|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p230_188|p230|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p230_177|p230|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p230_163|p230|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p230_003|p230|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p230_017|p230|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p230_201|p230|Racism has no place in any sport.
p230_215|p230|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
p230_203|p230|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p230_217|p230|My life is in the ballet.
p230_001|p230|Please call Stella.  
p230_029|p230|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p230_175|p230|City sentiment is in his favour.
p230_161|p230|Are you from the rugby?
p230_149|p230|However, he was later released without charge.
p230_411|p230|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p230_377|p230|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p230_363|p230|Nobody else was with me.
p230_405|p230|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p230_388|p230|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p230_389|p230|He could face a jail sentence.
p230_362|p230|I am a lucky man.
p230_404|p230|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p230_410|p230|The second goal was superb.
p230_376|p230|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p230_148|p230|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p230_160|p230|And does it?
p230_174|p230|Phase one was a shambles.
p230_028|p230|Life was like a timetable.
p230_014|p230|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p230_216|p230|He has made his base in Spain.
p230_202|p230|Tommy is not a problem.
p230_206|p230|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p230_212|p230|There is no quick fix.
p230_038|p230|They said she was stable.
p230_010|p230|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p230_158|p230|You had to go and see him.
p230_170|p230|One season, they might do well.
p230_164|p230|Our position remains the same.
p230_372|p230|This is a major championship.
p230_414|p230|It is the old story.
p230_400|p230|It is a large number.
p230_366|p230|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p230_399|p230|That investment has now been secured.
p230_398|p230|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p230_401|p230|You will not feel a thing.
p230_367|p230|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p230_373|p230|It's going to be fun.
p230_415|p230|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p230_165|p230|Nobody did in those days.
p230_171|p230|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p230_159|p230|So what is the campaign about?
p230_005|p230|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p230_039|p230|This will save interest charges.
p230_213|p230|All will be revealed in due course.
p230_207|p230|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p230_239|p230|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p230_211|p230|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p230_205|p230|He had suffered a heart attack.
p230_013|p230|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p230_007|p230|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p230_167|p230|It's nice to be nice.
p230_173|p230|But he has a lifeline.
p230_198|p230|I made a terrible start.
p230_359|p230|Three years ago he would have been.
p230_365|p230|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p230_417|p230|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
p230_371|p230|My goal is quite simple.
p230_416|p230|No date has been set for a meeting.
p230_370|p230|We are really good friends.
p230_364|p230|We put our bid in last night.
p230_402|p230|I've never seen a game like it.
p230_358|p230|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p230_199|p230|The result is called a patent.
p230_172|p230|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p230_166|p230|We believe in the medium term.
p230_006|p230|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p230_012|p230|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p230_204|p230|This is a holy place.
p230_210|p230|We have an election in eight days.
p230_238|p230|She died in middle age.
p237_063|p237|It's a real challenge.
p237_275|p237|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p237_249|p237|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p237_301|p237|That could change.
p237_315|p237|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p237_329|p237|I am so upset.
p237_103|p237|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p237_117|p237|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p237_102|p237|But it was a pleasure.
p237_328|p237|It is a job creation scheme.
p237_314|p237|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p237_300|p237|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p237_248|p237|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p237_260|p237|Our decision making was poor.
p237_274|p237|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p237_062|p237|None has ever been found.
p237_076|p237|The price cuts are really exciting.
p237_089|p237|Now the system is right behind us.
p237_060|p237|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p237_074|p237|Painful, but only because it's true.
p237_048|p237|I feel pretty good.
p237_289|p237|She failed in her action.
p237_262|p237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p237_276|p237|It is also very valuable.
p237_316|p237|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p237_302|p237|He should have won.
p237_114|p237|I came to complete.
p237_100|p237|They were outside the circle.
p237_128|p237|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p237_129|p237|She really suffered for her art.
p237_101|p237|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p237_303|p237|Who can predict?
p237_317|p237|It is no surprise.
p237_277|p237|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p237_263|p237|They are different types.
p237_288|p237|You know the type.
p237_049|p237|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p237_075|p237|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p237_061|p237|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p237_059|p237|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p237_065|p237|Art is extra.
p237_071|p237|Try to save us.
p237_298|p237|Holland won by five wickets.
p237_267|p237|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p237_273|p237|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p237_313|p237|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p237_307|p237|Graeme was prepared.
p237_139|p237|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p237_111|p237|It's in his blood.
p237_105|p237|I didn't play well last year.
p237_104|p237|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p237_110|p237|Further protests are likely.
p237_138|p237|They took a risk.
p237_306|p237|I was the sheep.
p237_312|p237|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p237_272|p237|This is a big club.
p237_266|p237|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p237_299|p237|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p237_070|p237|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p237_064|p237|You do not change overnight.
p237_058|p237|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p237_099|p237|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p237_072|p237|The end result is precisely the same.
p237_066|p237|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p237_258|p237|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
p237_270|p237|Special measures were needed.
p237_264|p237|There's the mix.
p237_338|p237|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
p237_304|p237|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p237_310|p237|This is a war over our home.
p237_106|p237|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p237_112|p237|Who would be right?
p237_113|p237|It's a shame.
p237_107|p237|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p237_311|p237|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p237_305|p237|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p237_339|p237|They haven't got a hope.
p237_265|p237|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p237_271|p237|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p237_259|p237|You can feel at home in China.
p237_067|p237|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p237_073|p237|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p237_098|p237|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p237_014|p237|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p237_028|p237|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p237_216|p237|It is a gamble.
p237_202|p237|Our strategy is straightforward.
p237_160|p237|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p237_174|p237|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p237_148|p237|He is severe.
p237_149|p237|She died at her home.
p237_175|p237|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p237_161|p237|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p237_203|p237|Is that success?
p237_217|p237|He is slightly confused.
p237_029|p237|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p237_001|p237|Please call Stella.  
p237_015|p237|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p237_003|p237|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p237_017|p237|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p237_201|p237|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p237_215|p237|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p237_229|p237|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p237_349|p237|Nobody else was with me.
p237_188|p237|Government will intervene.
p237_177|p237|The release attracted little attention.
p237_163|p237|We are now up against it.
p237_162|p237|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p237_176|p237|Does that put pressure on us?
p237_189|p237|Four policemen were wounded.
p237_348|p237|Look at the witnesses.
p237_228|p237|William Hague delighted his party.
p237_214|p237|There was an e-mail.
p237_200|p237|It is a case of taking a risk.
p237_016|p237|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
p237_002|p237|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p237_006|p237|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p237_012|p237|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p237_238|p237|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p237_204|p237|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p237_210|p237|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p237_199|p237|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p237_172|p237|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p237_166|p237|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p237_167|p237|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p237_173|p237|He is keen to stay in public service.
p237_198|p237|If the director is with you.
p237_211|p237|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p237_205|p237|Tommy is not a problem.
p237_239|p237|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p237_013|p237|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p237_007|p237|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p237_039|p237|The problem is the pitch.
p237_011|p237|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p237_005|p237|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p237_213|p237|Now, it's all right.
p237_207|p237|He was also married with two children.
p237_159|p237|It is not normal practice.
p237_165|p237|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p237_171|p237|I was in the train station overnight.
p237_170|p237|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p237_164|p237|I was in daily contact.
p237_206|p237|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
p237_212|p237|I don't want to use it.
p237_004|p237|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p237_010|p237|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p237_038|p237|It is not for any other purpose.
p237_035|p237|I'd like to continue that record.
p237_021|p237|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p237_009|p237|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p237_237|p237|They are the innocent victims.
p237_223|p237|The FBI could become involved.
p237_343|p237|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p237_182|p237|One season, they might do well.
p237_196|p237|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p237_141|p237|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p237_155|p237|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p237_169|p237|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p237_168|p237|They should stop the bombing.
p237_154|p237|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p237_140|p237|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p237_183|p237|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p237_342|p237|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p237_222|p237|By hard work, is the answer.
p237_236|p237|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p237_008|p237|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p237_020|p237|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p237_034|p237|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p237_036|p237|They're just different.
p237_220|p237|I had decided to quit the show.
p237_234|p237|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p237_208|p237|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p237_340|p237|It has moved on in the last week.
p237_195|p237|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p237_181|p237|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p237_156|p237|It is huge.
p237_142|p237|He has the edge.
p237_143|p237|Three penalties were given.
p237_157|p237|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p237_180|p237|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p237_194|p237|It is tough, but possible.
p237_341|p237|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p237_235|p237|I can't wait to meet him.
p237_221|p237|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p237_037|p237|It was clear.
p237_023|p237|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p237_027|p237|I have a theory.
p237_033|p237|This is the window.
p237_219|p237|I began to pray.
p237_225|p237|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p237_231|p237|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p237_351|p237|It should be scrapped.
p237_345|p237|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p237_190|p237|They receive a high profile in the media.
p237_184|p237|This is a sad day.
p237_153|p237|He will emerge as a world leader.
p237_147|p237|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p237_146|p237|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p237_185|p237|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p237_191|p237|It's a joke.
p237_344|p237|The train was on time.
p237_350|p237|The composer will conduct.
p237_230|p237|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p237_224|p237|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p237_218|p237|She should not be blamed.
p237_032|p237|There's a story, too.
p237_026|p237|They should be so lucky.
p237_018|p237|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p237_030|p237|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p237_024|p237|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p237_232|p237|I am immensely sad.
p237_226|p237|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p237_346|p237|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p237_187|p237|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p237_193|p237|I wish I could say something.
p237_178|p237|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p237_144|p237|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p237_150|p237|Is that Titanic?
p237_151|p237|The idea is simple.
p237_145|p237|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p237_179|p237|He was a crazy man.
p237_192|p237|Miller was every bit as happy.
p237_186|p237|The hotel was now for sale.
p237_347|p237|Indeed, it was magical.
p237_227|p237|You have to do your research.
p237_233|p237|I'd never seen a play about me.
p237_025|p237|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p237_031|p237|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p237_019|p237|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p237_095|p237|Until you hit the big games.
p237_081|p237|It's all going to clear the debt.
p237_056|p237|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p237_042|p237|This film will be totally awesome.
p237_297|p237|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p237_283|p237|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p237_254|p237|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p237_240|p237|You take a risk.
p237_268|p237|That could be in place by next year.
p237_320|p237|They were fantastic.
p237_334|p237|I saw some good things.
p237_308|p237|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p237_122|p237|It is a delight on every level.
p237_136|p237|They made such decisions in London.
p237_137|p237|It's perfectly feasible.
p237_123|p237|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p237_309|p237|It is a road of death.
p237_335|p237|He can do no wrong.
p237_321|p237|I never thought it would take this long.
p237_241|p237|They tried to give her advice.
p237_255|p237|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p237_282|p237|This is a question of Islam.
p237_296|p237|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p237_043|p237|That is a break with tradition.
p237_057|p237|I was inspired by two things.
p237_080|p237|It may well have been.
p237_094|p237|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p237_082|p237|I first met him last summer.
p237_096|p237|We could not get any possession.
p237_041|p237|He did not know his daughter.
p237_055|p237|Life is good.
p237_069|p237|It is like a river running by my home.
p237_280|p237|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p237_294|p237|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p237_243|p237|It's a dead end.
p237_257|p237|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p237_337|p237|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p237_323|p237|It should be equal.
p237_135|p237|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p237_121|p237|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p237_109|p237|It is normal.
p237_108|p237|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p237_120|p237|Does this mean.
p237_134|p237|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p237_322|p237|They wanted the club to make money.
p237_256|p237|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p237_242|p237|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p237_295|p237|I saw it at a ruck.
p237_281|p237|There is no link.
p237_068|p237|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p237_054|p237|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p237_040|p237|It's a great thing.
p237_097|p237|I love the Dome.
p237_083|p237|He is driven.
p237_087|p237|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p237_093|p237|We must look forward.
p237_078|p237|It is a terrible place.
p237_044|p237|It's the only thing.
p237_050|p237|It is bizarre.
p237_285|p237|Immediate action must be taken.
p237_291|p237|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p237_246|p237|They should come forward.
p237_252|p237|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p237_332|p237|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p237_326|p237|In the old days, it was easy.
p237_118|p237|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p237_130|p237|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p237_124|p237|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p237_125|p237|But it took a lot of bottle.
p237_131|p237|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p237_119|p237|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p237_327|p237|The parents will have a great time, too.
p237_333|p237|He was then replaced by Ross.
p237_253|p237|We were extremely poor.
p237_247|p237|It is not the message alone.
p237_290|p237|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p237_284|p237|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p237_051|p237|That should do it.
p237_045|p237|It is so sad.
p237_079|p237|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p237_092|p237|However, it did not end that way.
p237_086|p237|It's never too late.
p237_090|p237|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p237_084|p237|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p237_053|p237|She looked so young.
p237_047|p237|It is urgent.
p237_292|p237|They seem to get away with it.
p237_286|p237|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p237_279|p237|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p237_251|p237|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p237_245|p237|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p237_325|p237|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p237_331|p237|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p237_127|p237|I'm so angry.
p237_133|p237|Who will attend?
p237_132|p237|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p237_126|p237|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p237_330|p237|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p237_318|p237|We want to play at the worlds.
p237_244|p237|We are in the hat.
p237_250|p237|It's quite a line-up !
p237_278|p237|The warning is timely.
p237_287|p237|We're in shock.
p237_293|p237|People have no choice.
p237_046|p237|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p237_052|p237|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p237_085|p237|Someone who cares
p237_091|p237|Today I couldn't run on it.
p345_014|p345|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p345_028|p345|The racist abuse was terrible.
p345_174|p345|Bombing is the easy option.
p345_160|p345|And so they have.
p345_148|p345|His words were not audible.
p345_376|p345|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p345_362|p345|Our task is to complete the picture.
p345_389|p345|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345_363|p345|It is a road of death.
p345_377|p345|The letters are going out today.
p345_149|p345|That's a huge amount.
p345_161|p345|I have a great respect for her.
p345_175|p345|We should have gone solo.
p345_029|p345|What is the new religion?
p345_015|p345|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p345_001|p345|Please call Stella.
p345_217|p345|It's a human tragedy.
p345_203|p345|No, it's never been mentioned.
p345_215|p345|At the time, he was a living legend.
p345_201|p345|It was too close to call.
p345_229|p345|It will be all about the Olympics.
p345_017|p345|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p345_003|p345|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p345_163|p345|IT takes the biscuit.
p345_177|p345|That will be the case.
p345_188|p345|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p345_361|p345|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p345_375|p345|Suddenly, there was an audience.
p345_349|p345|I saw one body.
p345_348|p345|I just know it's a lot.
p345_374|p345|This is bound to happen.
p345_360|p345|It is not simple.
p345_189|p345|We've seen that time and time again.
p345_176|p345|Directing, if you like.
p345_162|p345|I suggest a new plan.
p345_002|p345|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p345_016|p345|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p345_228|p345|But he is not hopeful.
p345_200|p345|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p345_214|p345|It happens in real life.
p345_238|p345|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345_210|p345|But it is looking very positive.
p345_204|p345|Things were so intense in the studio.
p345_012|p345|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p345_006|p345|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p345_166|p345|Miller was every bit as happy.
p345_172|p345|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p345_199|p345|I know my sons.
p345_358|p345|This was a good performance.
p345_364|p345|The Government would be ready, they said.
p345_370|p345|I don't believe a word of it.
p345_371|p345|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p345_365|p345|Her life is now back on track.
p345_359|p345|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p345_198|p345|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p345_173|p345|It was like a kick in the belly.
p345_167|p345|The result is utterly compelling.
p345_007|p345|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p345_013|p345|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p345_205|p345|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
p345_211|p345|Drugs are getting through.
p345_239|p345|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p345_207|p345|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p345_213|p345|I want to put myself on discussion also.
p345_039|p345|A killer is also on the loose.
p345_005|p345|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p345_011|p345|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p345_159|p345|However, he did not stay there very long.
p345_171|p345|It is a hobby for me.
p345_165|p345|We don't have a solution to the problem.
p345_373|p345|The winner will be announced in December.
p345_367|p345|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p345_398|p345|This was a unique election.
p345_399|p345|It was still there last night.
p345_400|p345|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p345_366|p345|I said at the time it was wrong.
p345_372|p345|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p345_164|p345|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p345_170|p345|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p345_158|p345|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p345_010|p345|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p345_004|p345|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p345_038|p345|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
p345_212|p345|He would have come into the house.
p345_206|p345|Then another one came.
p345_261|p345|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p345_275|p345|Anyone else can apply.
p345_249|p345|It is understood he had been stabbed.
p345_063|p345|The sleeper was six hours late.
p345_077|p345|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345_088|p345|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345_117|p345|It is really good news.
p345_103|p345|This is his personal life.
p345_315|p345|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p345_301|p345|It will be extremely difficult for him.
p345_329|p345|His father said, My son was lucky.
p345_328|p345|I am not against a further inquiry.
p345_300|p345|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p345_314|p345|It should not make the same mistake again.
p345_102|p345|There's something about being cut off.
p345_116|p345|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345_089|p345|I believe that so strongly.
p345_076|p345|But her parents will never see her again.
p345_062|p345|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p345_248|p345|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
p345_274|p345|And they still have the final to come.
p345_260|p345|What is so unusual about this case?
p345_276|p345|He looked like a schoolboy.
p345_262|p345|But this is different.
p345_289|p345|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p345_074|p345|How do we get more people in?
p345_060|p345|No casualties were reported.
p345_048|p345|The opposite is the case.
p345_100|p345|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p345_114|p345|Let's get it on.
p345_128|p345|She has left the island.
p345_302|p345|It's a gigantic con.
p345_316|p345|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p345_317|p345|It's always a dilemma.
p345_303|p345|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p345_129|p345|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p345_115|p345|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345_101|p345|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p345_049|p345|Who would be a referee?
p345_061|p345|The classes are taking place.
p345_075|p345|The defender made an impressive debut.
p345_288|p345|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
p345_263|p345|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p345_277|p345|It was like the old days.
p345_273|p345|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345_267|p345|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p345_298|p345|This could prove a problem.
p345_059|p345|They were willing us to get a second.
p345_071|p345|I had to lie.
p345_065|p345|It would be a last resort.
p345_139|p345|They were part of our own family.
p345_105|p345|If not, a deal could take many months.
p345_111|p345|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p345_307|p345|This is too much like Scotland.
p345_313|p345|They were not missing much.
p345_312|p345|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p345_306|p345|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345_110|p345|I would probably have to agree with him.
p345_104|p345|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p345_138|p345|I was on my own.
p345_064|p345|There will be no threat to the game.
p345_070|p345|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p345_058|p345|I've never seen anything like it.
p345_299|p345|I was a local hero.
p345_272|p345|This action could have been avoided.
p345_258|p345|We're looking for unity in the council.
p345_264|p345|It doesn't look good.
p345_270|p345|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p345_066|p345|That is part of athletics.
p345_072|p345|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p345_099|p345|It has to work.
p345_112|p345|He had a moustache.
p345_106|p345|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p345_338|p345|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p345_310|p345|That goes back a long way.
p345_304|p345|This club have been fair to me.
p345_305|p345|I didn't know she could do that.
p345_311|p345|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345_339|p345|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p345_107|p345|I was going to help with the dinner.
p345_113|p345|I have been thinking about that this week.
p345_098|p345|However, his involvement was instant.
p345_073|p345|Everyone was writing me off.
p345_067|p345|Who would have known.
p345_271|p345|They've been at it for five hours.
p345_265|p345|That will not change.
p345_259|p345|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p345_240|p345|There are two options.
p345_254|p345|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p345_268|p345|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345_283|p345|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p345_297|p345|Immediate action must be taken.
p345_042|p345|You can see how he made his money.
p345_056|p345|We expect them to deliver for us.
p345_081|p345|It was that kind of afternoon.
p345_095|p345|He was at it again yesterday.
p345_136|p345|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p345_122|p345|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p345_334|p345|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345_320|p345|It is a symbolic concert.
p345_308|p345|I can't say anything about any figure.
p345_309|p345|A counter reaction was.
p345_321|p345|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p345_335|p345|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p345_123|p345|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p345_137|p345|That's not fair to the supporters.
p345_094|p345|It was a funny feeling.
p345_080|p345|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p345_057|p345|He was between people and God.
p345_043|p345|However, there were some alarming findings.
p345_296|p345|I said, What was that about?
p345_282|p345|We are not going to be complacent.
p345_269|p345|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345_255|p345|I don't think he was being very fair.
p345_241|p345|I can't describe it.
p345_257|p345|But the foundations have been laid.
p345_243|p345|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345_294|p345|But they miss the whole point.
p345_280|p345|We can build on that.
p345_055|p345|Others said he had gone too far.
p345_041|p345|You've got to be vigilant.
p345_069|p345|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p345_096|p345|You can't go on forever.
p345_082|p345|It is a freedom.
p345_121|p345|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p345_135|p345|He would just say it was terrible.
p345_109|p345|What are they like?
p345_323|p345|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p345_337|p345|I'm very happy tonight.
p345_336|p345|I just want to do the good work.
p345_322|p345|It is a very beautiful city.
p345_108|p345|Would you pay to come and see it?
p345_134|p345|The shooting created panic in the street.
p345_120|p345|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p345_083|p345|What happens next?
p345_097|p345|So far this season this approach is working.
p345_068|p345|We were caught out.
p345_040|p345|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345_054|p345|We will be paying agency rates.
p345_281|p345|It could be a danger.
p345_295|p345|You have to count on other people.
p345_242|p345|Surely it should be the other way round.
p345_256|p345|You've got to fight to stay up.
p345_252|p345|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p345_246|p345|I am appalled by this news.
p345_291|p345|I don't think we could have expected better.
p345_285|p345|He's a joy to follow.
p345_078|p345|I have nothing to lose.
p345_050|p345|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p345_044|p345|Who wants to be a Millionaire?
p345_093|p345|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p345_087|p345|They should come clean.
p345_118|p345|We just want a fair deal.
p345_124|p345|It is sad and frustrating.
p345_130|p345|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p345_326|p345|I was waiting for that question.
p345_332|p345|Five years later, the deception continued.
p345_333|p345|I might get an injury very easily.
p345_327|p345|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p345_131|p345|It certainly should not be used too often.
p345_125|p345|Our intentions are real.
p345_119|p345|I'll just have to live with that.
p345_086|p345|He insisted that his staff were too.
p345_092|p345|They don't work anymore anyway.
p345_045|p345|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p345_051|p345|It was time to act.
p345_079|p345|He would have loved it.
p345_284|p345|His body was found in May.
p345_290|p345|It starts to get you down.
p345_247|p345|No injuries were reported.
p345_253|p345|THE waiting game continues.
p345_279|p345|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345_245|p345|This is wonderful news.
p345_251|p345|We were extremely arrogant.
p345_286|p345|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p345_292|p345|My life has been turned upside down.
p345_047|p345|His record with England was not good.
p345_053|p345|I could never be cool.
p345_084|p345|All our futures will already have been decided.
p345_090|p345|That, though, is an old story.
p345_133|p345|I don't know where that one came from.
p345_127|p345|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345_319|p345|Is she in trouble?
p345_331|p345|We will win the argument.
p345_325|p345|I am very happy with him.
p345_324|p345|But could it afford to run it?
p345_330|p345|WHO would have thought it?
p345_318|p345|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p345_126|p345|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p345_132|p345|The whole matter is done and dusted.
p345_091|p345|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p345_085|p345|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p345_052|p345|It's a question of fashion.
p345_046|p345|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_293|p345|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345_287|p345|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p345_250|p345|It's too much work.
p345_244|p345|I get on him, he gets on me.
p345_278|p345|But that is about to change.
p345_223|p345|Must have been at the bar.
p345_237|p345|Rangers are my life.
p345_021|p345|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p345_035|p345|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p345_009|p345|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p345_155|p345|It may have been a cry for help.
p345_141|p345|I don't have any perspective on it.
p345_169|p345|Other forces were, however, at work.
p345_196|p345|Business has never been so bad.
p345_182|p345|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345_357|p345|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
p345_343|p345|No one would believe him.
p345_394|p345|To begin with it looks good.
p345_380|p345|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p345_381|p345|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p345_395|p345|I won't go back to Holland.
p345_342|p345|He is already in place.
p345_356|p345|We had a good time.
p345_183|p345|They had seven children.
p345_197|p345|There is no way to do this.
p345_168|p345|But it won't be the same.
p345_140|p345|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345_154|p345|Normally it would be four minutes.
p345_008|p345|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p345_034|p345|We had to laugh.
p345_020|p345|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p345_236|p345|I didn't know where they were.
p345_222|p345|That was a disgraceful performance.
p345_234|p345|That is not an easy thing.
p345_220|p345|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p345_208|p345|Everything has been destroyed.
p345_036|p345|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p345_022|p345|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p345_142|p345|Scotland has lost a great man.
p345_156|p345|But the damage had been done.
p345_181|p345|We don't know what happened.
p345_195|p345|I never want to have any children.
p345_340|p345|Now it was serious.
p345_354|p345|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p345_368|p345|Anything that was going, really.
p345_383|p345|Is he going to look after them?
p345_397|p345|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p345_396|p345|There is still a long way to go.
p345_382|p345|Or is it?
p345_369|p345|He will take it in his stride.
p345_355|p345|Everything is up for grabs.
p345_341|p345|This is his first movie.
p345_194|p345|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p345_180|p345|They have known the hard times.
p345_157|p345|No, you couldn't make it up.
p345_143|p345|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p345_023|p345|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p345_037|p345|I was completely knackered.
p345_209|p345|The Lobby is not failing.
p345_221|p345|It's the right thing.
p345_235|p345|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p345_219|p345|I am going to fight to the end.
p345_231|p345|We have all been there at some point.
p345_225|p345|I can't get away from it.
p345_033|p345|It's a lot of pressure on me.
p345_027|p345|All the people here are local.
p345_147|p345|It plainly does not work.
p345_153|p345|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345_184|p345|That in itself is an erotic experience.
p345_190|p345|I was never alone with her, right?
p345_379|p345|And therein lies the problem.
p345_345|p345|But something has been lost in the translation.
p345_351|p345|There was no discussion about it.
p345_386|p345|It is quite simple.
p345_392|p345|It was a game we had to win.
p345_393|p345|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p345_350|p345|I am very happy.
p345_344|p345|We live in shorthand.
p345_378|p345|I did not name it.
p345_191|p345|It's not only my respect for them.
p345_185|p345|Death is outside the language.
p345_152|p345|I still think he will win.
p345_146|p345|For some, it was more painful than others.
p345_026|p345|I want to go home.
p345_032|p345|I am prepared to step down.
p345_224|p345|But this is just the start.
p345_230|p345|They are very frightened.
p345_218|p345|But we are losing that connection.
p345_226|p345|I believe in the Union.
p345_232|p345|This is my homeland.
p345_018|p345|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p345_024|p345|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p345_030|p345|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p345_178|p345|Now, it's all right.
p345_150|p345|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
p345_144|p345|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p345_193|p345|This is a very high price.
p345_187|p345|It's all too early.
p345_352|p345|Three hours later, the man was free.
p345_346|p345|Spent three months alone at sea.
p345_391|p345|There is ample evidence.
p345_385|p345|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p345_384|p345|They are appealing for witnesses.
p345_390|p345|His instructions were clear.
p345_347|p345|I made a big mistake.
p345_353|p345|It was a very big win for us.
p345_186|p345|You have a plan?
p345_192|p345|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p345_145|p345|His name has not been released.
p345_151|p345|It was even worse than at home.
p345_179|p345|All will be revealed in due course.
p345_031|p345|It's an amazing landscape!
p345_025|p345|This is a new era.
p345_019|p345|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p345_233|p345|The game was up.
p345_227|p345|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p374_056|p374|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p374_042|p374|YOU thought it was a headache.
p374_297|p374|I don't know them or anything.
p374_283|p374|And we're not there yet.
p374_268|p374|I was an athlete.
p374_254|p374|This is certainly not the case.
p374_240|p374|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p374_308|p374|It was a foolhardy decision.
p374_320|p374|No one was listening.
p374_334|p374|We just want them home.
p374_122|p374|The course is in great condition.
p374_136|p374|Does it make a profit?
p374_137|p374|Now, that would impress the kids.
p374_123|p374|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p374_335|p374|And we have beaten them before.
p374_321|p374|It's not one for the purists.
p374_309|p374|This is as bad as it can get.
p374_241|p374|It's always somebody else's.
p374_255|p374|There is great potential on this river.
p374_269|p374|We don't need to change the law.
p374_282|p374|He did very well, but didn't win.
p374_296|p374|That was the theory, anyway.
p374_043|p374|I still hope to go.
p374_057|p374|It is simple, really.
p374_080|p374|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p374_094|p374|This was much worse.
p374_082|p374|I have great respect for all my players.
p374_096|p374|I'm working at the moment.
p374_069|p374|It's going to be epic.
p374_041|p374|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p374_055|p374|I suspect the latter.
p374_280|p374|I am also delighted for all the players.
p374_294|p374|This is a club on the rise.
p374_243|p374|We can make a difference.
p374_257|p374|Our thoughts are with his family.
p374_337|p374|That is the fact of the matter.
p374_323|p374|It really is good to be back.
p374_109|p374|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p374_135|p374|The contest was already over.
p374_121|p374|Paterson was the man.
p374_120|p374|That's not going to happen again.
p374_134|p374|They are a good team.
p374_108|p374|Lester was like that.
p374_322|p374|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p374_336|p374|He has two children.
p374_256|p374|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p374_242|p374|It could now be up to the courts.
p374_295|p374|I had a sense of deja vu.
p374_281|p374|We are delighted with that.
p374_054|p374|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p374_040|p374|I've had a ball.
p374_068|p374|This time it is official.
p374_097|p374|However, this is only the start.
p374_083|p374|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p374_087|p374|It would be very dangerous.
p374_093|p374|It doesn't always work that way.
p374_044|p374|Does that put pressure on us?
p374_050|p374|He had reason to be pleased.
p374_078|p374|This is a great day.
p374_285|p374|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p374_291|p374|It opened last month.
p374_246|p374|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p374_252|p374|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
p374_332|p374|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p374_326|p374|We cannot go on like this.
p374_130|p374|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p374_124|p374|It is too early to speculate.
p374_118|p374|It ignores the future.
p374_119|p374|The quality of work is very impressive.
p374_125|p374|It's up to them.
p374_131|p374|I was very fortunate.
p374_327|p374|The biggest thing is structure.
p374_333|p374|What is that?
p374_253|p374|Which means it matters.
p374_247|p374|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p374_290|p374|He's very good at relating to adults.
p374_284|p374|People don't feel safe, including me.
p374_079|p374|He got his degree.
p374_051|p374|We have a problem.
p374_045|p374|As a player you have to move on.
p374_092|p374|It's not right of Labour.
p374_086|p374|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p374_090|p374|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p374_084|p374|There is no question of dithering.
p374_053|p374|That alibi is now gone.
p374_047|p374|I am inclined to play it down.
p374_292|p374|Just a year later he was dead.
p374_286|p374|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p374_251|p374|It was not pretty.
p374_245|p374|It is just so sad.
p374_279|p374|It was the first time they met.
p374_325|p374|It will never happen.
p374_331|p374|SO now we know the secret.
p374_319|p374|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p374_127|p374|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p374_133|p374|Players want to know what is on offer.
p374_132|p374|It had been in place since last July.
p374_126|p374|They went to the press.
p374_318|p374|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p374_330|p374|We certainly have to try something.
p374_324|p374|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p374_278|p374|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p374_244|p374|This was not a contest.
p374_250|p374|The members have clearly spoken.
p374_287|p374|It is something that we will put right.
p374_293|p374|You must be ready to play anyone.
p374_046|p374|It is so out of character.
p374_052|p374|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p374_085|p374|His track record is not promising.
p374_091|p374|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p374_009|p374|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p374_035|p374|We are expecting a big crowd.
p374_021|p374|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p374_237|p374|That doesn't happen in Europe.
p374_223|p374|I wonder what they listen to?
p374_380|p374|Is something which we just don't do.
p374_394|p374|Well, you can have a tree.
p374_419|p374|They have not been named.
p374_343|p374|It's a great idea.
p374_357|p374|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p374_182|p374|He had planned to sell it.
p374_196|p374|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p374_169|p374|That's the kind of production it was.
p374_141|p374|Where is the logic in that?
p374_155|p374|I have been there already.
p374_154|p374|Next league matches Motherwell.
p374_140|p374|The whole region is in shock.
p374_168|p374|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p374_197|p374|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p374_183|p374|It was just one of those days.
p374_356|p374|It does seem a mystery.
p374_342|p374|So what is their secret?
p374_424|p374|It will be crucial.
p374_418|p374|And well he might.
p374_395|p374|I just don't know what she was doing.
p374_381|p374|He was taken ill in his office.
p374_222|p374|All of the names are familiar to me.
p374_236|p374|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p374_020|p374|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p374_034|p374|What you sow, you have to reap.
p374_008|p374|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p374_022|p374|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p374_036|p374|I was contacted this morning.
p374_208|p374|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p374_220|p374|This is not a European Army.
p374_234|p374|They want it to work.
p374_397|p374|You can't have both.
p374_383|p374|It's the only thing.
p374_368|p374|It is a matter for Westminster.
p374_354|p374|Clark is back on top form.
p374_340|p374|But we can't have a casino.
p374_195|p374|The stadium was full.
p374_181|p374|I was doing well at the hustings.
p374_156|p374|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p374_142|p374|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p374_143|p374|I told the players that at half-time.
p374_157|p374|Scott and Emily were so happy.
p374_180|p374|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p374_194|p374|This is the New Edinburgh.
p374_341|p374|I'm looking forward to that.
p374_355|p374|But happily, the story is true.
p374_369|p374|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p374_382|p374|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p374_396|p374|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p374_235|p374|For once it wasn't about money.
p374_221|p374|Not so, he insisted.
p374_209|p374|They were that poor.
p374_037|p374|He didn't want me to leave the house.
p374_023|p374|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p374_027|p374|The game today is certainly different.
p374_033|p374|I will always remember the horrible images.
p374_225|p374|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p374_231|p374|I suspect that it will.
p374_219|p374|History is made at the Masters.
p374_392|p374|These days are over.
p374_386|p374|For tragedy it is.
p374_351|p374|I did not have a bet on myself.
p374_345|p374|I have been struggling with my form.
p374_423|p374|That time has passed.
p374_379|p374|I am not changing my mind.
p374_190|p374|It's a matter of time.
p374_184|p374|But it did not last.
p374_153|p374|But opinion was divided.
p374_147|p374|Raymond was always on the outside.
p374_146|p374|It was indeed a night to remember.
p374_152|p374|That's the important thing.
p374_185|p374|She has been unable to work since.
p374_191|p374|The number never came.
p374_378|p374|It was located on the remote control.
p374_344|p374|It was not being marketed properly.
p374_422|p374|Next year this time  we will be home.
p374_350|p374|We were unlucky not to score.
p374_387|p374|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p374_393|p374|They do it properly.
p374_218|p374|That is just not true.
p374_230|p374|We used to keep our business rates.
p374_224|p374|Does a lot of drawing.
p374_032|p374|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p374_026|p374|This isn't some form of commission.
p374_030|p374|And that was just for starters.
p374_024|p374|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p374_018|p374|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p374_232|p374|We need to think.
p374_226|p374|There are moments of honesty, too.
p374_385|p374|What's the best thing to do?
p374_391|p374|The hotel was huge.
p374_420|p374|It feels like too much.
p374_346|p374|That was about it.
p374_352|p374|As if they ever stopped.
p374_408|p374|That was never their agenda.
p374_187|p374|I know nothing about that.
p374_193|p374|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p374_144|p374|I see the extended family once a year.
p374_150|p374|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p374_178|p374|There's no reason for panic.
p374_179|p374|We have got away with it.
p374_151|p374|They may differ on other issues.
p374_145|p374|Why is this?
p374_192|p374|You encourage them - you can do it.
p374_186|p374|No-one has ever seen inside.
p374_409|p374|I certainly will not settle.
p374_353|p374|And that brings us to the point.
p374_421|p374|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p374_347|p374|It is coming on very well.
p374_390|p374|We are all very pleased.
p374_384|p374|Two others were also seriously injured.
p374_227|p374|He is doing just that.
p374_233|p374|We are very happy with the verdict.
p374_019|p374|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p374_025|p374|She had to learn a new discipline.
p374_031|p374|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p374_028|p374|We did it in one take.
p374_014|p374|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p374_216|p374|There was great support all round the route.
p374_202|p374|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p374_389|p374|It was good today.
p374_362|p374|It is almost like a family.
p374_404|p374|Well, you can't have everything.
p374_410|p374|He said it was the worst possible result.
p374_376|p374|I want to get at the truth.
p374_148|p374|There is something in this.
p374_160|p374|And sooner than we may think.
p374_174|p374|The statement was a lie.
p374_175|p374|It is the manager's decision.
p374_161|p374|It is a step up.
p374_149|p374|And so it should.
p374_411|p374|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p374_377|p374|Everyone here is very sad.
p374_363|p374|But when we do it is great.
p374_405|p374|They have not given them the evidence.
p374_388|p374|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p374_203|p374|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p374_217|p374|I had nothing to lose.
p374_001|p374|Please call Stella.
p374_015|p374|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p374_029|p374|I'll take the blame for that.
p374_003|p374|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p374_017|p374|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p374_229|p374|That is bad enough.
p374_201|p374|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p374_215|p374|I'm really proud of my young players.
p374_349|p374|By hard work, is the answer.
p374_375|p374|The mood was euphoric.
p374_413|p374|I don't make it mystical.
p374_407|p374|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p374_361|p374|I hope that is the lucky break.
p374_188|p374|We have not given up.
p374_177|p374|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p374_163|p374|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p374_162|p374|You probably have never seen them before.
p374_176|p374|It was a day for records.
p374_189|p374|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
p374_406|p374|We need to chat.
p374_360|p374|One person had a broken back.
p374_374|p374|This is the goal.
p374_412|p374|It's always the same, isn't it?
p374_348|p374|We won't go down without a struggle.
p374_214|p374|I thought their commitment was superb.
p374_200|p374|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p374_228|p374|The night is young.
p374_016|p374|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p374_002|p374|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p374_006|p374|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p374_012|p374|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p374_204|p374|It was so unfair.
p374_210|p374|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p374_238|p374|Jackson may well be right.
p374_416|p374|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
p374_370|p374|I can't believe the buzz.
p374_364|p374|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p374_402|p374|I will have to think about it.
p374_358|p374|It's for that reason he should resign.
p374_199|p374|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p374_172|p374|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p374_166|p374|I made a mistake.
p374_167|p374|I'd never given up on myself.
p374_173|p374|The rest is his own.
p374_198|p374|His name is Michael Owen.
p374_359|p374|It's a good start.
p374_365|p374|My game is coming back.
p374_403|p374|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p374_417|p374|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p374_371|p374|Sport is good for you.
p374_239|p374|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p374_211|p374|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p374_205|p374|Smith has not let him down.
p374_013|p374|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p374_007|p374|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p374_011|p374|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p374_005|p374|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p374_039|p374|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p374_213|p374|All these things have an impact.
p374_207|p374|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p374_398|p374|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p374_401|p374|Or so it seemed.
p374_367|p374|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p374_373|p374|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p374_415|p374|Neither could be contacted last night.
p374_165|p374|Something has got to change.
p374_171|p374|It is not for me, though.
p374_159|p374|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p374_158|p374|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p374_170|p374|Little girls are his victims.
p374_164|p374|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p374_372|p374|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p374_414|p374|So what was he really doing?
p374_400|p374|You do not change overnight.
p374_366|p374|It was a game they could have won.
p374_399|p374|I was influenced by all of these things.
p374_206|p374|They have to be dealt with.
p374_212|p374|We're very close to being a good team.
p374_038|p374|It's not just a challenge for us.
p374_004|p374|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p374_010|p374|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p374_088|p374|Now it has been eclipsed.
p374_077|p374|It is not a standing army.
p374_063|p374|Nobody did in those days.
p374_249|p374|I get very excited by that.
p374_275|p374|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p374_261|p374|I just want to get rid of it.
p374_329|p374|This is great news for us.
p374_301|p374|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p374_315|p374|It's never over until it's over.
p374_103|p374|I hope they understand that.
p374_117|p374|I fell in love with it.
p374_116|p374|If that is not a warning, what is it?
p374_102|p374|Two and a half million people have died.
p374_314|p374|I am not a threat to coaches.
p374_300|p374|Because we do not need it.
p374_328|p374|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p374_260|p374|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p374_274|p374|He got very close tonight.
p374_248|p374|It all depends on the Chancellor.
p374_062|p374|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p374_076|p374|What method of funding is being used?
p374_089|p374|Our numbers are small.
p374_048|p374|However, it's good to turn the page.
p374_060|p374|That took a long time to happen.
p374_074|p374|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
p374_289|p374|Perhaps we should do the same.
p374_262|p374|I have not come in to take over.
p374_276|p374|It is our other home.
p374_316|p374|He had been a singer.
p374_302|p374|They use them for everything.
p374_128|p374|We are very pleased.
p374_114|p374|I don't think it would make any difference.
p374_100|p374|I want to be there by right.
p374_101|p374|That was very important.
p374_115|p374|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p374_129|p374|You're not going to get hurt.
p374_303|p374|I've already got this.
p374_317|p374|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p374_277|p374|Where do you start?
p374_263|p374|Is this accurate?
p374_288|p374|I had a good life at Rangers.
p374_075|p374|I'd love to do another Olympics.
p374_061|p374|It was on fire.
p374_049|p374|His condition was serious but stable.
p374_065|p374|Where is the discipline?
p374_071|p374|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p374_059|p374|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p374_298|p374|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p374_267|p374|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p374_273|p374|We can only do that for so long.
p374_313|p374|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p374_307|p374|But that's another story for another day.
p374_111|p374|We were never told it was already decided.
p374_105|p374|It's a very, very special day.
p374_139|p374|How much of a cop out is that?
p374_138|p374|It was the only possible decision.
p374_104|p374|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p374_110|p374|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p374_306|p374|But it has all been worthwhile.
p374_312|p374|There was a hell of a row.
p374_272|p374|That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
p374_266|p374|I am expecting to win.
p374_299|p374|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p374_058|p374|The net is closing.
p374_070|p374|She could easily have been killed.
p374_064|p374|You, the British people, are the boss.
p374_099|p374|He loved it, and so did they.
p374_072|p374|I didn't mean to kill her.
p374_066|p374|We were very much a happy family.
p374_270|p374|All of us do.
p374_264|p374|But what did it matter?
p374_258|p374|It is a technique.
p374_304|p374|There's a story, too.
p374_310|p374|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p374_338|p374|It was a matter of choice.
p374_106|p374|Let that be their memorial.
p374_112|p374|It was a sickening sight.
p374_113|p374|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
p374_107|p374|We're all paying for it.
p374_339|p374|And that's good news for the magpies.
p374_311|p374|It was just awful.
p374_305|p374|There have been different reports from different people.
p374_259|p374|The court has not decided.
p374_265|p374|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p374_271|p374|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p374_067|p374|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p374_073|p374|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p374_098|p374|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p318_029|p318|However, it's good to turn the page.
p318_217|p318|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p318_203|p318|This is not a European Army.
p318_388|p318|I was released after six days.
p318_363|p318|This is an internal matter.
p318_405|p318|The Open champion is back.
p318_411|p318|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p318_377|p318|She is currently in foster care.
p318_161|p318|I can make one further announcement.
p318_175|p318|It was that kind of night.
p318_149|p318|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p318_148|p318|A review of the decision is being sought.
p318_174|p318|Dewar is the medium.
p318_160|p318|He had never run the distance before.
p318_410|p318|I knew people on that committee.
p318_376|p318|She died at her home.
p318_362|p318|It was the same at Twickenham.
p318_404|p318|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p318_389|p318|That time is not far away.
p318_202|p318|It looks as though there is no chance.
p318_216|p318|We are still paying the price for that.
p318_028|p318|I intend to raise the matter there.
p318_014|p318|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p318_002|p318|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p318_016|p318|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p318_200|p318|How do we get more people in?
p318_214|p318|We are a party for people, not against people.
p318_228|p318|And then a funny thing happened.
p318_374|p318|I am a little bit tired.
p318_412|p318|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p318_406|p318|It's going to be a new challenge.
p318_360|p318|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p318_348|p318|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p318_189|p318|They were that poor.
p318_176|p318|It is very much a matter for them.
p318_162|p318|The General Election is all to play for.
p318_163|p318|It was a fiery game.
p318_177|p318|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p318_188|p318|His manager blamed the referee.
p318_349|p318|It has been handled entirely properly.
p318_407|p318|As, indeed, they would be.
p318_361|p318|Well, you can have a tree.
p318_375|p318|That was never their agenda.
p318_413|p318|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p318_229|p318|It does not take much.
p318_215|p318|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p318_201|p318|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p318_017|p318|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p318_007|p318|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p318_013|p318|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p318_239|p318|I was an athlete.
p318_205|p318|So she told him.
p318_211|p318|I suspect that it will.
p318_359|p318|The hotel was huge.
p318_417|p318|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p318_371|p318|I see it as my job.
p318_365|p318|They took a risk.
p318_403|p318|It would have been very easily done.
p318_198|p318|This is a really serious issue.
p318_173|p318|The stadium was full.
p318_167|p318|It will not be easy for him.
p318_166|p318|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p318_172|p318|That is not a position they enjoy.
p318_199|p318|So they will settle again.
p318_364|p318|I am amazed at what he's done.
p318_402|p318|This fight is not going to go away.
p318_416|p318|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p318_370|p318|The hearing was fair.
p318_358|p318|Closure is not one of them.
p318_210|p318|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p318_204|p318|Election results are expected soon.
p318_238|p318|There is nothing to fear.
p318_012|p318|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p318_006|p318|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p318_038|p318|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p318_010|p318|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p318_212|p318|But there's no eye contact.
p318_206|p318|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p318_399|p318|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p318_400|p318|His primary residence is Scotland.
p318_366|p318|The idea was presented to me.
p318_372|p318|This was not a summit about the euro.
p318_414|p318|We never agreed to it.
p318_158|p318|Who was on the panel?
p318_164|p318|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p318_170|p318|There is a simmering anger out there.
p318_171|p318|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p318_165|p318|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p318_159|p318|They may differ on other issues.
p318_373|p318|Frank Warren is a great man.
p318_415|p318|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p318_401|p318|I found that much more challenging.
p318_367|p318|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p318_398|p318|He says it often enough.
p318_207|p318|There are moments of honesty, too.
p318_213|p318|The squad will be the same for France.
p318_005|p318|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p318_011|p318|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p318_039|p318|It helped to get me noticed.
p318_089|p318|This gives us a lot of practice.
p318_076|p318|This was much worse.
p318_062|p318|They said they were only young men.
p318_274|p318|My mother is a widow.
p318_260|p318|I read it every year.
p318_248|p318|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p318_300|p318|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p318_314|p318|But they had to be paid for.
p318_328|p318|It went on to become an annual event.
p318_102|p318|There was no trouble at all.
p318_116|p318|We act because we must.
p318_117|p318|They will be destroyed.
p318_103|p318|Although, you never know.
p318_329|p318|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p318_315|p318|The odds are that it will.
p318_301|p318|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p318_249|p318|We should be rewarded for producing.
p318_261|p318|He was in contention almost every week.
p318_275|p318|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p318_063|p318|I was chosen to do this.
p318_077|p318|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p318_088|p318|This could be her way forward.
p318_061|p318|The firm was down and almost out.
p318_075|p318|I'm so worried about the roads.
p318_049|p318|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p318_288|p318|We have it on video.
p318_263|p318|It is up to Ann.
p318_277|p318|It's an absolute disgrace.
p318_317|p318|They deserve a lot of credit.
p318_303|p318|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p318_115|p318|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p318_101|p318|This is my personal assessment.
p318_129|p318|Raymond was always on the outside.
p318_128|p318|What has changed since then?
p318_100|p318|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p318_114|p318|I was very fortunate.
p318_302|p318|I can feel the sound inside.
p318_316|p318|But then they scored their fourth.
p318_276|p318|There have been different reports from different people.
p318_262|p318|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p318_289|p318|I am not a threat to coaches.
p318_048|p318|We were very much a happy family.
p318_074|p318|But you can go beyond that condition.
p318_060|p318|It is not a standing army.
p318_058|p318|In a way he was.
p318_064|p318|I learned a lot from that.
p318_070|p318|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p318_299|p318|The incident is being taken seriously.
p318_266|p318|I had trouble with the producers.
p318_272|p318|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p318_312|p318|I am not a paedophile.
p318_306|p318|It may well have been.
p318_138|p318|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p318_110|p318|I took the gun.
p318_104|p318|We shall be victorious.
p318_105|p318|The quality of work is very impressive.
p318_111|p318|It's just one of those things.
p318_139|p318|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p318_307|p318|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p318_313|p318|Some of their movement was excellent.
p318_273|p318|There is no more money.
p318_267|p318|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p318_298|p318|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p318_071|p318|There were no formal announcements.
p318_065|p318|The house was so well alight.
p318_059|p318|It's back to how it used to be.
p318_098|p318|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p318_073|p318|It really has left the town in shock.
p318_067|p318|Sandy was very active.
p318_259|p318|Perhaps we should do the same.
p318_271|p318|I expect a rapid response.
p318_265|p318|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p318_339|p318|I can't believe the buzz.
p318_305|p318|SO now we know the secret.
p318_311|p318|Could you put it in writing?
p318_107|p318|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p318_113|p318|We played so well at times.
p318_112|p318|A web site is planned for November.
p318_106|p318|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p318_310|p318|And we have beaten them before.
p318_304|p318|I am not a fan of books.
p318_338|p318|They've been wonderful to me.
p318_264|p318|We are playing them at their own game.
p318_270|p318|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p318_258|p318|Or so everyone believed.
p318_066|p318|He got his degree.
p318_072|p318|Before the games it was pretty open.
p318_099|p318|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p318_094|p318|It was forced to divert.
p318_080|p318|Did they give any good advice?
p318_057|p318|We might be back next year.
p318_043|p318|We are not moving in.
p318_296|p318|Is being naturally funny enough?
p318_282|p318|I'm confident we can do that.
p318_255|p318|Our people are paying high prices.
p318_241|p318|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p318_269|p318|The conference is the first test.
p318_321|p318|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p318_335|p318|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p318_309|p318|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p318_123|p318|There is a great carry over value.
p318_137|p318|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p318_136|p318|This week is a perfect example.
p318_122|p318|It's a way of making a mark.
p318_308|p318|It was a simple question.
p318_334|p318|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p318_320|p318|Then came the crunch.
p318_268|p318|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p318_240|p318|Life was like a timetable.
p318_254|p318|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p318_283|p318|Funding needs to be long term.
p318_297|p318|What's the point of staying sober?
p318_042|p318|That, though, was just the start of it.
p318_056|p318|I have really noticed that this week.
p318_081|p318|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p318_095|p318|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p318_083|p318|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p318_097|p318|But Allen is deadly serious.
p318_040|p318|They hit me in the head.
p318_054|p318|He will be judged by his actions.
p318_068|p318|However, there is great potential in this right.
p318_281|p318|It was a foolhardy decision.
p318_295|p318|We gave them the goal.
p318_242|p318|I tried to push him away.
p318_256|p318|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p318_336|p318|He pleaded for caution.
p318_322|p318|But will they fall in love?
p318_134|p318|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p318_120|p318|The Tory party will last.
p318_108|p318|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p318_109|p318|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p318_121|p318|It was a journey into a new life.
p318_135|p318|I mean it happens.
p318_323|p318|As if they ever stopped.
p318_337|p318|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p318_257|p318|Nor is it likely to do so.
p318_243|p318|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p318_294|p318|That, though, is to miss the point.
p318_280|p318|One thing is sure.
p318_069|p318|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p318_055|p318|Her role in it was small.
p318_041|p318|But he is not using them.
p318_096|p318|That's the National Grid.
p318_082|p318|This does not help.
p318_086|p318|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p318_092|p318|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p318_079|p318|They must be kept on the ground.
p318_045|p318|I never had a childhood.
p318_051|p318|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p318_284|p318|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p318_290|p318|Painful, but only because it's true.
p318_247|p318|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p318_253|p318|It is a memorial.
p318_333|p318|But when we do it is great.
p318_327|p318|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p318_119|p318|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p318_131|p318|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p318_125|p318|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p318_124|p318|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p318_130|p318|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p318_118|p318|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p318_326|p318|For a few years we had good fun.
p318_332|p318|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p318_252|p318|The man became a reporter.
p318_246|p318|We haven't come out of this very well.
p318_291|p318|It's never over until it's over.
p318_285|p318|I would never even consider it.
p318_050|p318|My brother is buried under there.
p318_044|p318|We have not had a formal request.
p318_078|p318|We are confident of taking that back.
p318_093|p318|There's also the point.
p318_087|p318|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p318_091|p318|It's a very, very special day.
p318_085|p318|He has lost confidence and weight.
p318_052|p318|What were they?
p318_046|p318|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p318_293|p318|This year, it was a little different.
p318_287|p318|The end result is precisely the same.
p318_278|p318|Something was plainly wrong.
p318_250|p318|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p318_244|p318|This was done by the council staff.
p318_318|p318|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p318_324|p318|The referee had a shocking game.
p318_330|p318|We are now in an election period.
p318_126|p318|What's the point?
p318_132|p318|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p318_133|p318|I am sorry to hear this news.
p318_127|p318|Why is this?
p318_331|p318|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p318_325|p318|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p318_319|p318|Why is that?
p318_245|p318|The truth is otherwise.
p318_251|p318|Which, in effect, it is.
p318_279|p318|Why should he go anywhere?
p318_286|p318|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p318_292|p318|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p318_047|p318|We offered something different.
p318_053|p318|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p318_084|p318|That's why the ministers resigned.
p318_090|p318|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p318_034|p318|That is impressive by any standards.
p318_020|p318|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318_008|p318|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p318_236|p318|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p318_222|p318|If not, he should go home.
p318_381|p318|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p318_395|p318|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p318_342|p318|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p318_424|p318|We have no plans for direct action.
p318_356|p318|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p318_418|p318|Would they work together again?
p318_183|p318|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p318_197|p318|They should feel ashamed.
p318_140|p318|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p318_154|p318|The salary changes are long overdue.
p318_168|p318|This one is a special case.
p318_169|p318|But what are the songs about?
p318_155|p318|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p318_141|p318|That sort of thing is long gone.
p318_196|p318|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p318_182|p318|From now on there is no hiding place.
p318_419|p318|I didn't play all that well.
p318_357|p318|It seems very odd.
p318_343|p318|It's no less intriguing, however.
p318_394|p318|You can't go back and change things.
p318_380|p318|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p318_223|p318|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p318_237|p318|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p318_009|p318|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p318_021|p318|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p318_035|p318|We are doing very well as we are.
p318_023|p318|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p318_037|p318|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p318_221|p318|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p318_235|p318|My body is exhausted.
p318_209|p318|The night is young.
p318_396|p318|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p318_382|p318|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p318_355|p318|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p318_341|p318|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p318_369|p318|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p318_194|p318|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p318_180|p318|We won't do that.
p318_157|p318|I am not blaming audiences.
p318_143|p318|However, consumers may take a different view.
p318_142|p318|It is typical of me.
p318_156|p318|If so, we want to hear from them.
p318_181|p318|I hope we do.
p318_195|p318|They believed it worked.
p318_368|p318|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p318_340|p318|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p318_354|p318|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p318_383|p318|It's always the same, isn't it?
p318_397|p318|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p318_208|p318|It was good to score the goal today.
p318_234|p318|Is it the shape of things to come?
p318_220|p318|Some of the players have not progressed.
p318_036|p318|The waiting is over, well almost.
p318_022|p318|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p318_026|p318|It is never an easy game.
p318_032|p318|It was important to win the singles.
p318_218|p318|It is not a wish list.
p318_224|p318|There is no margin for error.
p318_230|p318|She asked us a lot of questions.
p318_393|p318|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p318_387|p318|Sure, we have problems.
p318_378|p318|That's the only thing that matters.
p318_350|p318|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p318_344|p318|It's a question of perception.
p318_422|p318|Now, that is a good deal.
p318_191|p318|We have understood the problems for some time.
p318_185|p318|The United Nations must act.
p318_152|p318|I am ashamed of them.
p318_146|p318|But the championship is not over yet.
p318_147|p318|We haven't found out anything different.
p318_153|p318|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p318_184|p318|He quit in October.
p318_190|p318|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p318_345|p318|Staff have been informed.
p318_423|p318|The whole nation will be delighted.
p318_351|p318|That might help a bit.
p318_379|p318|I enjoy the creative process.
p318_386|p318|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p318_392|p318|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p318_231|p318|It was a stunning strike.
p318_225|p318|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p318_219|p318|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p318_033|p318|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p318_027|p318|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p318_019|p318|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p318_031|p318|I thought it was quite good.
p318_025|p318|They will be dealt with.
p318_233|p318|They hold on for many years.
p318_227|p318|That figure will always remain with me.
p318_384|p318|We have been preparing all year.
p318_390|p318|I may think about performing it.
p318_409|p318|He deserves a top team.
p318_421|p318|It appears to have been closed down.
p318_347|p318|This morning was very quiet.
p318_353|p318|He was made redundant in February last year.
p318_186|p318|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p318_192|p318|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p318_179|p318|He's got a great chance of making it.
p318_145|p318|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p318_151|p318|Surely it can do better than that?
p318_150|p318|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p318_144|p318|They played it like a cup final.
p318_178|p318|Any error is severely punished.
p318_193|p318|All these things have an impact.
p318_187|p318|Her daughter is getting married.
p318_352|p318|Two others were also seriously injured.
p318_420|p318|Who can tell?
p318_346|p318|My heart is not so sure.
p318_408|p318|I want to keep him.
p318_391|p318|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p318_385|p318|We could learn a lot from them.
p318_226|p318|From our point of view, it is the right time.
p318_232|p318|It is a technique.
p318_024|p318|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p318_030|p318|We have to put this behind us.
p318_018|p318|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316_320|p316|There was too much at stake.
p316_334|p316|He is on the wrong side.
p316_308|p316|We have got to attack.
p316_254|p316|It opened last month.
p316_240|p316|It is the men who create the demand.
p316_268|p316|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p316_297|p316|Which brings us to the point.
p316_283|p316|There are no quick fixes.
p316_056|p316|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316_042|p316|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
p316_095|p316|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
p316_081|p316|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p316_080|p316|They control the prices paid to farmers.
p316_094|p316|There are no problems between us at all.
p316_043|p316|We accept the challenge.
p316_057|p316|There was only silence.
p316_282|p316|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p316_296|p316|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p316_269|p316|This is a good move for me.
p316_241|p316|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316_255|p316|This will be our new beginning.
p316_309|p316|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p316_335|p316|That was a disgraceful performance.
p316_321|p316|I read about it in the newspapers.
p316_137|p316|He is a bully.
p316_123|p316|It is all up to the Members.
p316_135|p316|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p316_121|p316|It's very ingenious.
p316_109|p316|I was not a joiner.
p316_337|p316|My son was too young to die.
p316_323|p316|Is that not uncanny?
p316_243|p316|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
p316_257|p316|I have totally had enough.
p316_280|p316|So, how did this happen?
p316_294|p316|War and force are not the only solutions.
p316_041|p316|There is a new confidence about the club.
p316_055|p316|But the law is very clear on this.
p316_069|p316|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p316_082|p316|Most of them have already gone home.
p316_096|p316|I've had it for the exams.
p316_097|p316|I hope it comes out all right.
p316_083|p316|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p316_068|p316|This is far too high.
p316_054|p316|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p316_040|p316|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316_295|p316|They would have to go to the Royal.
p316_281|p316|It's all a part of letting it go.
p316_256|p316|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p316_242|p316|Every case is completely different.
p316_322|p316|What did they think of her voice?
p316_336|p316|There will be no receivers.
p316_108|p316|I did not have faith in the procedures.
p316_120|p316|It's great news, isn't it.
p316_134|p316|She is not the world champion.
p316_118|p316|I think they have to change that.
p316_130|p316|The following are the principal provisions.
p316_124|p316|The two sets are different.
p316_332|p316|It will not work in our favour.
p316_326|p316|He was happy with his form.
p316_246|p316|It will be fine.
p316_252|p316|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
p316_285|p316|We've got the bronze.
p316_291|p316|We have been going for three years.
p316_078|p316|Robin Williams is subdued.
p316_044|p316|The question is, Will it be enough?
p316_050|p316|I would love to have him home.
p316_087|p316|He was caught and fired.
p316_093|p316|It's a much bigger problem.
p316_092|p316|Today she has been released.
p316_086|p316|Can you imagine a world without design?
p316_051|p316|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
p316_045|p316|After that it is up to the boss.
p316_079|p316|The judge was very nice.
p316_290|p316|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p316_284|p316|The change was not instant.
p316_253|p316|Why do it?
p316_247|p316|He should emerge as the winner.
p316_327|p316|His art was not just about emotions.
p316_333|p316|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p316_125|p316|And now the pressure is off.
p316_131|p316|Too much has already been said.
p316_119|p316|This series is for real.
p316_127|p316|Their opening was disastrous.
p316_133|p316|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p316_319|p316|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p316_325|p316|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p316_331|p316|But that is not an issue for now.
p316_279|p316|The deadline is real and absolute.
p316_251|p316|What a difference a game can make.
p316_245|p316|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p316_292|p316|We deserved the three points.
p316_286|p316|They use them for everything.
p316_053|p316|That is not the case this time.
p316_047|p316|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p316_090|p316|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p316_084|p316|Weaknesses there are, however.
p316_085|p316|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p316_091|p316|There was no bad behaviour.
p316_046|p316|They were taken to prove a point.
p316_052|p316|He had no enemies.
p316_287|p316|Who is to benefit from this change?
p316_293|p316|It is planned for London in the spring.
p316_244|p316|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p316_250|p316|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p316_278|p316|Footballers have also been targeted.
p316_330|p316|But we will not be scared.
p316_324|p316|It has to reinvent itself.
p316_318|p316|The police believe that the man was not injured.
p316_132|p316|Now, however, things are different.
p316_126|p316|You can see the appeal of running away.
p316_141|p316|I don't have many friends.
p316_155|p316|Things begin to spring to life.
p316_169|p316|Consumers will also benefit.
p316_182|p316|It was the same with the Dickens.
p316_196|p316|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p316_343|p316|I was shocked and outraged.
p316_357|p316|Do you know who we are?
p316_419|p316|Audiences there were shocked.
p316_380|p316|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p316_394|p316|There may be hope this year, however.
p316_237|p316|Then it was changed without notice.
p316_223|p316|They went back to the seventeenth.
p316_035|p316|Why you did it will never be known.
p316_021|p316|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
p316_009|p316|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p316_008|p316|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p316_020|p316|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p316_034|p316|There will always be problems on the way.
p316_222|p316|Look at a computer.
p316_236|p316|Where will the elderly go then?
p316_395|p316|That is not too bad.
p316_381|p316|Is that such a bad thing?
p316_418|p316|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316_356|p316|It is time for concerted national action.
p316_342|p316|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p316_197|p316|It is not just the agencies.
p316_183|p316|Of course it is still possible.
p316_168|p316|That happens in boxing.
p316_154|p316|You look at that.
p316_140|p316|And so the cycle continues.
p316_156|p316|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p316_142|p316|However, it was a different story in the final.
p316_195|p316|We shall not be moved.
p316_181|p316|But this relative success has not been easy.
p316_354|p316|We are doing okay in the league.
p316_340|p316|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p316_368|p316|It wasn't an easy decision.
p316_397|p316|They are not left wing.
p316_383|p316|Thousands of people were missing.
p316_220|p316|We need a much wider debate.
p316_234|p316|She said he did not look too happy.
p316_208|p316|My husband was fighting for his life.
p316_022|p316|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p316_036|p316|He was in his element.
p316_037|p316|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p316_023|p316|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p316_209|p316|It is not a financial issue.
p316_235|p316|We are aware of the problem.
p316_221|p316|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p316_382|p316|You do need a check and a balance.
p316_396|p316|They are taking a stand against this.
p316_369|p316|It left me with sadness.
p316_341|p316|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
p316_355|p316|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316_180|p316|We played better after the break.
p316_194|p316|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p316_143|p316|They exist in name alone.
p316_157|p316|I understood that concern.
p316_153|p316|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p316_147|p316|And frankly, it's been a while.
p316_190|p316|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p316_184|p316|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p316_379|p316|However, we let them back into the game.
p316_351|p316|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316_345|p316|It was extremely cold.
p316_423|p316|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p316_392|p316|It will benefit a lot of people.
p316_386|p316|I couldn't get out of bed.
p316_219|p316|We've made a couple of albums.
p316_225|p316|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316_231|p316|Its future is uncertain.
p316_027|p316|Have we tried everything?
p316_033|p316|It is not for any other purpose.
p316_032|p316|This is not a war on terror.
p316_026|p316|Meetings will also remain private.
p316_230|p316|We all knew it could not be true.
p316_224|p316|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p316_218|p316|I didn't just walk in and get it.
p316_387|p316|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p316_393|p316|A new school will be built.
p316_344|p316|Not many people like to do that.
p316_422|p316|We won very easily.
p316_350|p316|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p316_378|p316|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
p316_185|p316|That, in a way, is the point.
p316_191|p316|I just love lessons.
p316_146|p316|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p316_152|p316|Failure is not an option.
p316_178|p316|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p316_144|p316|I am not retiring.
p316_150|p316|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
p316_187|p316|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p316_193|p316|It's to do with this place.
p316_408|p316|That is my preference.
p316_420|p316|They responded in the most positive way.
p316_346|p316|Italy would be lukewarm.
p316_352|p316|The pensioners did not want to know.
p316_385|p316|It's time to move on.
p316_391|p316|But what will we put on it?
p316_232|p316|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p316_226|p316|However, it proved to be the turning point.
p316_018|p316|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316_030|p316|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p316_025|p316|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p316_031|p316|Naturally, she said yes.
p316_019|p316|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p316_227|p316|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p316_233|p316|It doesn't look good for her.
p316_390|p316|It changed my life.
p316_384|p316|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p316_353|p316|It was just awful.
p316_421|p316|The British government said she was coming home.
p316_347|p316|People are using it in their daily lives.
p316_409|p316|Taxation should be simplified.
p316_192|p316|Retirement is on his mind.
p316_186|p316|What is so unusual about this case?
p316_151|p316|They will appear again next week.
p316_145|p316|All will be revealed in due course.
p316_179|p316|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p316_160|p316|It was like a dream to be here.
p316_174|p316|But the foundations have been laid.
p316_148|p316|Feel for five seconds.
p316_362|p316|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p316_404|p316|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p316_410|p316|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p316_376|p316|This election is far from over.
p316_389|p316|I can't describe it.
p316_216|p316|It is too much for me.
p316_202|p316|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p316_014|p316|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p316_028|p316|It's not going to work out that way.
p316_029|p316|We have worked hard.
p316_001|p316|Please call Stella.
p316_015|p316|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p316_217|p316|But is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316_388|p316|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p316_411|p316|It is not that sort of inquiry.
p316_377|p316|So the Government will be damaged.
p316_363|p316|Two people have died.
p316_405|p316|I am glad that justice has been done.
p316_149|p316|I hope it is a good omen.
p316_175|p316|I have never seen him like that.
p316_161|p316|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316_177|p316|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
p316_163|p316|It would help to heal the wounds.
p316_188|p316|That would end it for us.
p316_375|p316|It is a flexible concept.
p316_413|p316|I have never been overly ambitious.
p316_407|p316|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p316_361|p316|It certainly gives you hope.
p316_349|p316|We have to open up.
p316_201|p316|I watch the other visitors.
p316_215|p316|They will do their own thing.
p316_229|p316|I waited and waited.
p316_003|p316|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p316_017|p316|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p316_016|p316|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p316_002|p316|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p316_228|p316|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
p316_214|p316|I am really sorry that he is going.
p316_200|p316|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p316_348|p316|Chelsea was a great club.
p316_406|p316|Its first awards will just do that.
p316_360|p316|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p316_374|p316|We said it will happen one night.
p316_412|p316|I have signed a contract.
p316_189|p316|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316_162|p316|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
p316_176|p316|And you need to be so resourceful.
p316_172|p316|They must not succeed.
p316_166|p316|It certainly sounded it at times.
p316_199|p316|However, he was later released without charge.
p316_358|p316|Souter will be back.
p316_416|p316|He was all blackened.
p316_370|p316|There is a changing of the guard.
p316_364|p316|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p316_402|p316|It was a great team effort.
p316_238|p316|He had a great game.
p316_204|p316|He confirmed his fitness.
p316_210|p316|We are in this for the long haul.
p316_006|p316|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p316_012|p316|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p316_013|p316|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p316_007|p316|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p316_211|p316|We have a budget in March.
p316_205|p316|The gap is narrowing.
p316_239|p316|The following year, they asked him again.
p316_365|p316|I am delighted to have her back home.
p316_403|p316|In my experience, he does not do that.
p316_417|p316|This is your country.
p316_371|p316|The boys are very confident.
p316_359|p316|I'd like to report a murder.
p316_198|p316|There must be boundaries.
p316_167|p316|It will be too hot.
p316_173|p316|He declined to provide a breakdown.
p316_159|p316|I am prepared to step down.
p316_165|p316|It's got to be in the head.
p316_171|p316|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p316_401|p316|How do you find the youngsters?
p316_367|p316|It is based on his movement records.
p316_373|p316|I know we can play a lot better.
p316_415|p316|I hope you don't regret it.
p316_398|p316|I was the sheep.
p316_213|p316|I got very, very tired.
p316_207|p316|Both men were uninjured.
p316_039|p316|We just want this season to end.
p316_011|p316|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p316_005|p316|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p316_004|p316|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p316_010|p316|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p316_038|p316|What a week he has had.
p316_206|p316|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
p316_212|p316|There was no respite.
p316_399|p316|I think we believed the tie was won.
p316_372|p316|It was our time maybe.
p316_414|p316|We were beaten by the better team.
p316_400|p316|Well, there you go.
p316_366|p316|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316_170|p316|None of the opinions is good.
p316_164|p316|We did not deserve to go through.
p316_158|p316|The things writers and directors say!
p316_103|p316|We had to push to get a goal.
p316_117|p316|Or someone wants to say something different.
p316_301|p316|She had denied the charge.
p316_315|p316|The film was great.
p316_329|p316|It's a production company.
p316_275|p316|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316_261|p316|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316_249|p316|We're just waiting for her reaction.
p316_077|p316|This is a big step up.
p316_063|p316|He said it was for sale.
p316_088|p316|I feel confident about the outcome.
p316_089|p316|The driver escaped injury.
p316_062|p316|He declined to give further details.
p316_076|p316|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p316_248|p316|They are you, the fans.
p316_260|p316|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p316_274|p316|The princess has strong links with Scotland.
p316_328|p316|Nato was not a love affair.
p316_314|p316|We told them in July.
p316_300|p316|Everyone agrees with that.
p316_116|p316|This is totally untrue.
p316_102|p316|It will take several days.
p316_114|p316|She has the biggest part.
p316_100|p316|I kept it very simple.
p316_128|p316|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p316_316|p316|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p316_302|p316|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p316_262|p316|What are you waiting for?
p316_276|p316|I just wanted to fly.
p316_289|p316|He knows what he's got to do.
p316_060|p316|However, our players will fight for that.
p316_074|p316|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_048|p316|And they removed a Borderer.
p316_049|p316|So, why does he do it?
p316_075|p316|It is clear that change is required.
p316_061|p316|Everyone was very saddened.
p316_288|p316|We are not defeated.
p316_277|p316|And he has a tale to tell.
p316_263|p316|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p316_303|p316|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316_317|p316|It's a real challenge.
p316_129|p316|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p316_101|p316|The rest was badminton.
p316_115|p316|We will win this tie.
p316_139|p316|I've won the British.
p316_111|p316|Until you hit the big games.
p316_105|p316|I would just like someone to confess.
p316_313|p316|How would it work?
p316_307|p316|Let's get to know him.
p316_267|p316|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316_273|p316|I began to pray.
p316_298|p316|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
p316_059|p316|It doesn't look as pretty.
p316_065|p316|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p316_071|p316|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p316_070|p316|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p316_064|p316|This is a dream come true.
p316_058|p316|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316_299|p316|I am quite excited about it.
p316_272|p316|I should have given him one in return.
p316_266|p316|Today was first class.
p316_306|p316|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316_312|p316|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p316_104|p316|That got me out.
p316_110|p316|It has to find out what went wrong.
p316_138|p316|The case was taken on by his brother.
p316_106|p316|We are making progress on waiting lists.
p316_112|p316|It has until Saturday.
p316_338|p316|The air campaign is not over yet.
p316_304|p316|I didn't feel good.
p316_310|p316|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
p316_258|p316|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316_270|p316|Feel the heat?
p316_264|p316|This is still happening in the US.
p316_072|p316|It has certainly paid off for him.
p316_066|p316|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p316_099|p316|It's a sensible management decision.
p316_098|p316|I will just have to be patient.
p316_067|p316|What on earth is wrong with you?
p316_073|p316|He was also a great man.
p316_265|p316|Another issue will be policing.
p316_271|p316|She was so full of life.
p316_259|p316|We shall be ready for Rangers.
p316_311|p316|It divided audiences at Cannes.
p316_305|p316|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316_339|p316|It's a national sport.
p316_113|p316|I've tried to get on with my life.
p316_107|p316|It will have to ratify the deal.
p329_255|p329|I just went a bit too far.
p329_282|p329|He was at home with his pals.
p329_296|p329|That would have been too easy.
p329_043|p329|That argument has been won.
p329_057|p329|It is the end of an era.
p329_080|p329|We will see how he is after treatment.
p329_094|p329|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329_137|p329|I felt under no pressure today.
p329_123|p329|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p329_309|p329|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p329_335|p329|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p329_321|p329|It is high time to act.
p329_320|p329|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p329_334|p329|That is not the way we should operate.
p329_308|p329|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
p329_122|p329|David was not either.
p329_136|p329|Each one has its own system.
p329_095|p329|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p329_081|p329|I was there for five hours.
p329_056|p329|We're into that build-up now.
p329_042|p329|There are big names.
p329_297|p329|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329_283|p329|We are taking it seriously.
p329_254|p329|He also presented You Bet!
p329_240|p329|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p329_268|p329|Now that was a boxing movie.
p329_256|p329|And how he kept his word.
p329_242|p329|I leave tonight for England.
p329_295|p329|Our young people are leaving.
p329_281|p329|I have beaten her a few times.
p329_068|p329|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p329_054|p329|She has a wonderful mind.
p329_040|p329|We know you will not let us down.
p329_097|p329|Drugs are always an issue.
p329_083|p329|I don't know why she is not here.
p329_108|p329|It may be argued.
p329_120|p329|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p329_134|p329|Is that too much to ask?
p329_322|p329|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p329_336|p329|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p329_337|p329|We have nothing to hide.
p329_323|p329|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p329_135|p329|I have so much respect for him.
p329_121|p329|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p329_109|p329|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p329_082|p329|But then he changed his mind.
p329_096|p329|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p329_041|p329|He will never walk the streets again.
p329_055|p329|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p329_069|p329|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_280|p329|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p329_294|p329|The referee had been right.
p329_243|p329|There is no change in our position.
p329_257|p329|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p329_253|p329|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p329_247|p329|We must learn from the past.
p329_290|p329|We had no part in it.
p329_284|p329|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p329_051|p329|I didn't have a clue.
p329_045|p329|I hope you will leave it at that.
p329_079|p329|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p329_092|p329|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p329_086|p329|I feel very strongly about that.
p329_125|p329|More patience and composure was required.
p329_131|p329|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p329_119|p329|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p329_327|p329|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p329_333|p329|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p329_332|p329|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p329_326|p329|There was barely a handful of chances.
p329_118|p329|That is different from being impartial.
p329_130|p329|It was an ambush.
p329_124|p329|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_087|p329|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p329_093|p329|I want to play at the highest level.
p329_078|p329|This avalanche is just beginning.
p329_044|p329|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p329_050|p329|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329_285|p329|Maybe this battle has been.
p329_291|p329|His father and mother are in film production.
p329_246|p329|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p329_252|p329|I have no comment to make.
p329_244|p329|Everything else is a bonus.
p329_250|p329|That could be at least five years away.
p329_278|p329|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p329_287|p329|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p329_293|p329|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p329_046|p329|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329_052|p329|How can they engage with the work?
p329_085|p329|There are no excuses.
p329_091|p329|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p329_132|p329|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p329_126|p329|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p329_330|p329|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p329_324|p329|The South African defended his work ethic.
p329_318|p329|The woman is basically off her head.
p329_319|p329|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p329_325|p329|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p329_331|p329|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p329_127|p329|There is no smoking gun.
p329_133|p329|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p329_090|p329|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p329_084|p329|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p329_053|p329|I have been coming here for nine years.
p329_047|p329|The bill would be massive.
p329_292|p329|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329_286|p329|The manager is there to make these decisions.
p329_279|p329|That's a very strong element.
p329_251|p329|That is my role.
p329_245|p329|We went on to become very successful.
p329_222|p329|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p329_236|p329|It really was a masterful innings.
p329_008|p329|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p329_020|p329|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p329_034|p329|We don't know the scale of need.
p329_168|p329|I am not a magician.
p329_154|p329|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p329_140|p329|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p329_197|p329|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p329_183|p329|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p329_418|p329|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p329_356|p329|We do not expect any surplus.
p329_342|p329|There is great interest on our island.
p329_424|p329|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p329_395|p329|And that started me thinking.
p329_381|p329|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p329_380|p329|I never agreed with that.
p329_394|p329|As if he were a High Court judge.
p329_343|p329|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p329_357|p329|You don't do the same thing with men.
p329_419|p329|We've come from a long way back.
p329_182|p329|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p329_196|p329|Nor should there have been.
p329_141|p329|That is a job for the Government.
p329_155|p329|I guess it is down to focus.
p329_169|p329|We couldn't go very fast.
p329_035|p329|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p329_021|p329|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p329_009|p329|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p329_237|p329|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p329_223|p329|I'm really happy with the way it went.
p329_209|p329|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p329_235|p329|This is my new career.
p329_221|p329|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p329_037|p329|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p329_023|p329|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p329_143|p329|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p329_157|p329|I have great respect for all my players.
p329_180|p329|I love the moment of being first.
p329_194|p329|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p329_369|p329|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329_341|p329|That is no use.
p329_355|p329|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p329_382|p329|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p329_396|p329|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p329_397|p329|It brings together two essential elements.
p329_383|p329|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p329_354|p329|Their mind was already made up.
p329_340|p329|It is now time for justice.
p329_368|p329|Such actions are rarely popular.
p329_195|p329|It is a scandal.
p329_181|p329|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p329_156|p329|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p329_142|p329|And he had much need.
p329_022|p329|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p329_036|p329|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p329_220|p329|Four people died instantly.
p329_234|p329|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p329_208|p329|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p329_230|p329|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p329_224|p329|It is a step on the way.
p329_218|p329|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p329_032|p329|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p329_026|p329|This could be one such case, he declared.
p329_146|p329|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p329_152|p329|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p329_185|p329|They responded with victories.
p329_191|p329|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p329_344|p329|Our house was very small.
p329_422|p329|The country is in a state of chaos.
p329_350|p329|I just had so much fun.
p329_378|p329|I see no reason for them to be.
p329_387|p329|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p329_393|p329|My father died in childbirth.
p329_392|p329|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p329_386|p329|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p329_379|p329|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p329_351|p329|It was quite rigorous.
p329_345|p329|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p329_423|p329|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
p329_190|p329|Who is going to be penalised?
p329_184|p329|Or so we have long assumed.
p329_153|p329|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329_147|p329|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p329_027|p329|It's not a solo.
p329_033|p329|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p329_219|p329|We find this very sad.
p329_225|p329|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p329_231|p329|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p329_227|p329|People tended to stay there for some time.
p329_233|p329|The boy is no longer with us.
p329_025|p329|But there has never been the time, she said.
p329_031|p329|I had found my vision.
p329_019|p329|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p329_151|p329|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p329_145|p329|This can only help us go forward.
p329_179|p329|It is too early to speculate.
p329_192|p329|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p329_186|p329|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p329_353|p329|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p329_421|p329|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p329_347|p329|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p329_409|p329|Players were held in equally low regard.
p329_390|p329|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329_384|p329|It is a dilemma.
p329_385|p329|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p329_391|p329|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p329_408|p329|It would show them a positive way forward.
p329_420|p329|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p329_346|p329|Later they changed their minds.
p329_352|p329|It is a decision which has paid off.
p329_187|p329|What is the truth about the cow?
p329_193|p329|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p329_178|p329|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p329_144|p329|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329_150|p329|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p329_018|p329|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p329_030|p329|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p329_024|p329|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p329_232|p329|This represents a tough game for us.
p329_226|p329|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p329_203|p329|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329_217|p329|I get to work with very good people.
p329_029|p329|I fell in love with ballet.
p329_001|p329|Please call Stella.
p329_015|p329|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p329_149|p329|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p329_175|p329|It is highly unlikely.
p329_161|p329|It will be a great night.
p329_411|p329|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p329_377|p329|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p329_363|p329|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p329_405|p329|They've been here before.
p329_388|p329|They did not interfere.
p329_389|p329|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p329_362|p329|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p329_404|p329|The film is about the cost of genius.
p329_410|p329|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p329_376|p329|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p329_160|p329|For a moment it was all about her.
p329_174|p329|She had experience of the wildest places.
p329_148|p329|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p329_014|p329|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p329_028|p329|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p329_216|p329|We are opening an inquiry.
p329_202|p329|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p329_228|p329|All businesses continue to trade.
p329_214|p329|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p329_200|p329|But these were the nights.
p329_016|p329|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p329_002|p329|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p329_162|p329|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p329_176|p329|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p329_189|p329|I think it's awful.
p329_348|p329|First is open defiance.
p329_406|p329|I want a free vote.
p329_360|p329|No, is the answer to your first question.
p329_374|p329|But we could not change his mind.
p329_412|p329|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p329_375|p329|We have a team to reach the final.
p329_413|p329|They have the cash to do that.
p329_407|p329|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p329_361|p329|There was support from across the board.
p329_349|p329|That is absolute nonsense.
p329_188|p329|They will want to watch a winning team.
p329_177|p329|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p329_163|p329|Trading Places was too obvious.
p329_003|p329|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p329_017|p329|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p329_201|p329|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p329_215|p329|The court has not decided.
p329_229|p329|It's a difficult job.
p329_211|p329|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p329_205|p329|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p329_239|p329|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329_013|p329|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p329_007|p329|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p329_167|p329|I see the extended family once a year.
p329_173|p329|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p329_198|p329|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p329_365|p329|We have been preparing all year.
p329_403|p329|Who has he fought?
p329_417|p329|It is so elusive and light.
p329_371|p329|I joined a group.
p329_359|p329|Pray that it is so.
p329_358|p329|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p329_416|p329|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p329_370|p329|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p329_364|p329|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p329_402|p329|People ask about the concept of a team.
p329_199|p329|I have a theory.
p329_172|p329|You probably have never seen them before.
p329_166|p329|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p329_006|p329|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p329_012|p329|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329_238|p329|I would urge the Government to think again.
p329_204|p329|He was jailed for five years.
p329_210|p329|What did they think of her voice?
p329_206|p329|We will not break even.
p329_212|p329|Three years probation is just a joke.
p329_004|p329|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p329_010|p329|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p329_038|p329|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p329_170|p329|There was even a joke.
p329_164|p329|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p329_158|p329|His track record is not promising.
p329_372|p329|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p329_414|p329|He was not seeking special advantage.
p329_400|p329|We have high hopes that this will work.
p329_366|p329|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p329_399|p329|He is a joy to watch.
p329_398|p329|The issue has still to be resolved.
p329_401|p329|We are now open.
p329_367|p329|So what does one do?
p329_373|p329|They probably expected something special from me.
p329_415|p329|There was a fine line to tread.
p329_159|p329|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p329_165|p329|That's the way it is.
p329_171|p329|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p329_039|p329|We're still talking with a few people.
p329_011|p329|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p329_005|p329|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p329_213|p329|We did not talk about it.
p329_207|p329|We will look into it.
p329_248|p329|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p329_260|p329|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p329_274|p329|I'd never heard him in person before.
p329_062|p329|I am still pretty young in this business.
p329_076|p329|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p329_089|p329|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p329_116|p329|She had been sexually assaulted.
p329_102|p329|There is no guarantee.
p329_328|p329|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p329_314|p329|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p329_300|p329|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p329_301|p329|That is just a load of baloney.
p329_315|p329|There is no threat to them.
p329_329|p329|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p329_103|p329|We make good weapons.
p329_117|p329|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p329_088|p329|He just wants to play.
p329_077|p329|I am so sorry.
p329_063|p329|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p329_275|p329|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p329_261|p329|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p329_249|p329|We told them in August.
p329_277|p329|He doesn't do dinner.
p329_263|p329|And a film maker was born.
p329_288|p329|Then followed a bout of flu.
p329_049|p329|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p329_075|p329|This will be no easy option.
p329_061|p329|His charisma is all on the course.
p329_129|p329|I didn't play well last year.
p329_101|p329|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p329_115|p329|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p329_303|p329|The damage from the fire was huge.
p329_317|p329|Nelson does not disappoint.
p329_316|p329|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p329_302|p329|I'm feeling very pleased.
p329_114|p329|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p329_100|p329|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p329_128|p329|The trial is set for February.
p329_060|p329|In short, the club was broke.
p329_074|p329|They seem to be backing off from that.
p329_048|p329|He was just a journalist.
p329_289|p329|I have worked with him on projects.
p329_262|p329|I have no argument with Scotland.
p329_276|p329|I saw them not long after it happened.
p329_272|p329|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329_266|p329|I hope he stays.
p329_299|p329|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p329_070|p329|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p329_064|p329|We're not the tourist board.
p329_058|p329|I have had no social life at all.
p329_104|p329|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p329_110|p329|I bought a car at auction.
p329_138|p329|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p329_306|p329|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329_312|p329|But both were involved with other matters.
p329_313|p329|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p329_307|p329|A play is a set of actions.
p329_139|p329|And that was the adults.
p329_111|p329|They agree to meet.
p329_105|p329|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p329_059|p329|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_065|p329|It was the same old story.
p329_071|p329|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_298|p329|This is not a faceless system.
p329_267|p329|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p329_273|p329|It's good news and long overdue.
p329_265|p329|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p329_271|p329|I might also completely change the routine.
p329_259|p329|He was a crazy man.
p329_067|p329|The Commons is too outdated.
p329_073|p329|He would be with his peers.
p329_098|p329|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p329_113|p329|It has been hijacked.
p329_107|p329|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p329_311|p329|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329_305|p329|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p329_339|p329|I'll take the blame for that.
p329_338|p329|It might have been a satanic ritual.
p329_304|p329|She had kept the news from him.
p329_310|p329|The campaign was raucous.
p329_106|p329|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329_112|p329|They could not hear.
p329_099|p329|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p329_072|p329|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p329_066|p329|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p329_258|p329|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p329_270|p329|There was a battle there.
p329_264|p329|It was also put on the Internet.
p311_374|p311|I recommend a tour.
p311_412|p311|Of course we aren't.
p311_348|p311|He added that he felt undermined.
p311_189|p311|Who do you think you are?
p311_162|p311|But no, it's not funny.
p311_176|p311|those who are preparing to give up.
p311_016|p311|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p311_002|p311|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p311_214|p311|Openness is always the best way.
p311_200|p311|Can you believe it?
p311_228|p311|I never made any offer to Mark.
p311_229|p311|It should be scrapped.
p311_201|p311|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p311_215|p311|It wouldn't go off.
p311_003|p311|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p311_017|p311|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p311_177|p311|What kind of festival is proposed?
p311_163|p311|In that case, the children were not missing.
p311_188|p311|But we still don't know.
p311_349|p311|I think we have got the balance right.
p311_375|p311|We don't ask for much.
p311_413|p311|We haven't been told.
p311_407|p311|We have reacted well to each other.
p311_361|p311|The actors are confident and polished.
p311_388|p311|That argument has been won.
p311_411|p311|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311_377|p311|I had a wonderful time working with him.
p311_363|p311|We would have concerns about that.
p311_405|p311|It was the same old story.
p311_175|p311|His only reply was a laugh.
p311_161|p311|They never got into the show this time.
p311_149|p311|It's been such a waste of money.
p311_001|p311|Please call Stella.
p311_015|p311|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p311_029|p311|It was a matter of chance.
p311_203|p311|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p311_217|p311|This was a lot of numbers.
p311_216|p311|It can be halted.
p311_202|p311|They are now out in the cold.
p311_028|p311|I was totally wrong.
p311_014|p311|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p311_148|p311|This is in a league of its own.
p311_160|p311|At least two women were among those arrested.
p311_174|p311|The highest rate is in Glasgow.
p311_362|p311|I hope he would have been very pleased.
p311_404|p311|We're not the tourist board.
p311_410|p311|This will be no easy option.
p311_376|p311|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p311_389|p311|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p311_399|p311|It is the end of an era.
p311_372|p311|They really want to do it.
p311_414|p311|It worked well in Monaco.
p311_400|p311|In short, the club was broke.
p311_366|p311|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p311_158|p311|It's there for people to look at.
p311_170|p311|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p311_164|p311|He changed my life.
p311_038|p311|That's what we're still trying to do.
p311_004|p311|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p311_010|p311|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p311_206|p311|This has been a shock.
p311_212|p311|But who will buy it?
p311_213|p311|It had to be more flexible.
p311_207|p311|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p311_011|p311|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
p311_005|p311|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p311_039|p311|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
p311_165|p311|There was nothing else to match it.
p311_171|p311|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p311_159|p311|The party will make up its own mind.
p311_401|p311|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p311_367|p311|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p311_373|p311|And then he laughs.
p311_415|p311|They were outside the circle.
p311_398|p311|Who can say?
p311_359|p311|It was like someone had died.
p311_365|p311|It's unusual to say the least.
p311_403|p311|The men are safe and unharmed.
p311_417|p311|He also called in at another farm.
p311_371|p311|This was a chilling echo.
p311_198|p311|It is that sort of film.
p311_167|p311|They haven't been thought through.
p311_173|p311|This is a very interesting move.
p311_013|p311|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p311_007|p311|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p311_239|p311|It's not a party, no, no.
p311_211|p311|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311_205|p311|Our message was inclusive.
p311_204|p311|I'm very frightened of the dark.
p311_210|p311|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p311_238|p311|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p311_006|p311|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p311_012|p311|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p311_172|p311|He was at home with his pals.
p311_166|p311|Two options are being proposed.
p311_199|p311|She was not hard done by.
p311_416|p311|The whole process was so different.
p311_370|p311|So he was anxious to try something new.
p311_364|p311|Taxes may need to rise.
p311_402|p311|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
p311_358|p311|I am greatly encouraged.
p311_303|p311|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p311_317|p311|But don't just take my word, for it.
p311_101|p311|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p311_115|p311|Otherwise we will pay the price.
p311_129|p311|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p311_075|p311|Craig is a major concern for us.
p311_061|p311|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p311_049|p311|What would you do if you didn't work?
p311_288|p311|It has become very confused.
p311_277|p311|There's a lot of hysteria.
p311_263|p311|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311_262|p311|There are many questions to be answered.
p311_276|p311|They also intend to travel today.
p311_289|p311|Fame and money followed.
p311_048|p311|There are different cultures in different departments.
p311_060|p311|His third goal was superb.
p311_074|p311|Already the children are dying.
p311_128|p311|It was a bit of a shock.
p311_114|p311|It is nearly there.
p311_100|p311|It is quite a new prescription.
p311_316|p311|This is not out of choice.
p311_302|p311|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p311_314|p311|Yes, it was uplifting.
p311_300|p311|It would have to be backdated.
p311_328|p311|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p311_116|p311|I find it rather oppressive.
p311_102|p311|Which he is, too.
p311_089|p311|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p311_062|p311|It has been declared.
p311_076|p311|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p311_260|p311|We are still alive and kicking.
p311_274|p311|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
p311_248|p311|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p311_249|p311|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p311_275|p311|He will do very well.
p311_261|p311|I want to go now.
p311_077|p311|I can't wait to meet him.
p311_063|p311|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p311_088|p311|I have hardly any commitments.
p311_103|p311|These matters are now behind us.
p311_117|p311|They are all Arabs.
p311_329|p311|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p311_301|p311|He said he was sorry.
p311_315|p311|Nobody should believe this story.
p311_339|p311|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
p311_311|p311|This is new money.
p311_305|p311|That was me today.
p311_113|p311|Don't get me wrong.
p311_107|p311|Is there anything in the wound?
p311_098|p311|He's got me very well.
p311_067|p311|He is a visionary.
p311_073|p311|I have spoken to the skipper.
p311_259|p311|How can this be?
p311_265|p311|They said we were out of touch.
p311_271|p311|They didn't find any substance.
p311_270|p311|He said he was delighted by the award.
p311_264|p311|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p311_258|p311|The family baton is handed on.
p311_072|p311|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p311_066|p311|In the end, however, it all came together.
p311_099|p311|It's like an extension of your body.
p311_106|p311|He, too, will return.
p311_112|p311|He has one son and one daughter.
p311_304|p311|We have worked well with them for years.
p311_310|p311|It was the climax of the thing.
p311_338|p311|Was it just negligent.
p311_306|p311|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p311_312|p311|We have not given up on the game.
p311_138|p311|We are still the best team in Britain.
p311_104|p311|But things are never the same again.
p311_110|p311|It is not really used by many people.
p311_058|p311|I just went a bit too far.
p311_070|p311|It happens in many countries.
p311_064|p311|The scientific debate is dead.
p311_299|p311|They're not always the same person.
p311_272|p311|They still have the dirty work to do.
p311_266|p311|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p311_267|p311|There is no signature.
p311_273|p311|I've never seen a game like it.
p311_298|p311|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p311_065|p311|Only one got through.
p311_071|p311|It's not just about the shows.
p311_059|p311|I am delighted for Simon.
p311_111|p311|There could be no dispute about our history.
p311_105|p311|It is easy to agree with him.
p311_139|p311|They got the job done.
p311_313|p311|The decision was left entirely to him.
p311_307|p311|That is when we are really effective.
p311_322|p311|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p311_336|p311|Bomber was not amused.
p311_120|p311|There were no new cases yesterday.
p311_134|p311|I could do a better job.
p311_108|p311|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p311_097|p311|The initial report has been completed.
p311_083|p311|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p311_054|p311|As a nation, we must become more active.
p311_040|p311|We cannot go on in this fashion.
p311_068|p311|I was the trial judge in both.
p311_295|p311|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311_281|p311|I am very happy with life.
p311_256|p311|The performance was really, really immense.
p311_242|p311|It was just above the roof.
p311_243|p311|It has changed, and not for the better.
p311_257|p311|Faces from the Eighties.
p311_280|p311|There are two ways to start a festival.
p311_294|p311|So there is a very real dilemma.
p311_069|p311|I have a choice.
p311_041|p311|We must learn to finish.
p311_055|p311|They should go ahead as normal.
p311_082|p311|Well, that's just a third district.
p311_096|p311|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p311_109|p311|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311_135|p311|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p311_121|p311|Someone else has now got them.
p311_337|p311|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p311_323|p311|It will make a huge difference.
p311_335|p311|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p311_321|p311|This was another video cassette.
p311_309|p311|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p311_137|p311|I get the bus.
p311_123|p311|These figures are truly terrible.
p311_080|p311|We've got a job to do.
p311_094|p311|The party has never fully recovered.
p311_043|p311|I knew my contract was up this year.
p311_057|p311|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p311_282|p311|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p311_296|p311|Then there's the Old Firm.
p311_241|p311|It may not be life long.
p311_255|p311|The film has also been superbly designed.
p311_269|p311|The kids are paying the price.
p311_268|p311|There is no point in denying that.
p311_254|p311|That's my daughter acting.
p311_240|p311|It's not that clear-cut.
p311_297|p311|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p311_283|p311|My office is down there.
p311_056|p311|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p311_042|p311|There can be no two ways about it.
p311_095|p311|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p311_081|p311|You just have to adjust.
p311_122|p311|But once again it was not converted.
p311_136|p311|Parole isn't a decision for me.
p311_308|p311|The director's a genius.
p311_320|p311|We'll see what happens.
p311_334|p311|You have to feel for the guy.
p311_318|p311|But this one has a lot of potential.
p311_330|p311|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
p311_324|p311|He pretended not to care.
p311_132|p311|Did he always want to be a comedian?
p311_126|p311|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p311_085|p311|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p311_091|p311|Some things in life you have to accept.
p311_046|p311|My heart is with the artist.
p311_052|p311|This is a holy place.
p311_287|p311|The defender made an impressive debut.
p311_293|p311|There is a solution, she believes.
p311_278|p311|The casualties were not named.
p311_244|p311|However, that is a sizeable if.
p311_250|p311|It's time to say enough is enough.
p311_251|p311|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p311_245|p311|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p311_279|p311|I was shaking on the blocks.
p311_292|p311|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p311_286|p311|We also hope to meet the men.
p311_053|p311|We will miss him very much.
p311_047|p311|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_090|p311|It is a very special place.
p311_084|p311|They are there to help us.
p311_127|p311|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p311_133|p311|The way ahead is not easy.
p311_325|p311|Not because they want to sing about something.
p311_331|p311|That is why we are here.
p311_319|p311|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p311_327|p311|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p311_333|p311|This time, however, may have been different.
p311_119|p311|He decides to do something about it.
p311_125|p311|I let go the telephone and ran.
p311_131|p311|Planning is a key issue.
p311_092|p311|I am relishing the challenge.
p311_086|p311|My wife and family are the support system.
p311_079|p311|It's the same as Glasgow.
p311_051|p311|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p311_045|p311|People acted too quickly.
p311_290|p311|I am not in denial.
p311_284|p311|Even then this game was not over.
p311_253|p311|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311_247|p311|I believe in theatre.
p311_246|p311|The English are coming.
p311_252|p311|He has to pull back from the brink.
p311_285|p311|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p311_291|p311|Shelter also supports the reform.
p311_044|p311|I am content with the silver.
p311_050|p311|They are already on the way there.
p311_078|p311|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p311_087|p311|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p311_093|p311|It is set in Paris.
p311_130|p311|Still, some additions are inspired.
p311_124|p311|This is a most serious matter.
p311_118|p311|It is already making a difference.
p311_332|p311|The German had a point to make.
p311_326|p311|I was in tears in the street.
p311_382|p311|And the winners are.
p311_396|p311|She is fulfilled by it.
p311_341|p311|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p311_355|p311|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p311_369|p311|We have some concerns.
p311_180|p311|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p311_194|p311|Nobody could survive on that.
p311_143|p311|We've not won anything yet.
p311_157|p311|He was part of South Africa.
p311_037|p311|They did a very good job.
p311_023|p311|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p311_235|p311|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p311_221|p311|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311_209|p311|There has also been some Scots input.
p311_208|p311|Everything in the symphony is there.
p311_220|p311|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311_234|p311|Where do we go from here?
p311_022|p311|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p311_036|p311|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p311_156|p311|It's like a high school play.
p311_142|p311|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p311_195|p311|They seem to turn up for them.
p311_181|p311|That will help my case a bit.
p311_368|p311|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p311_354|p311|So it goes on.
p311_340|p311|This Government is cutting taxes.
p311_397|p311|He said no survivors had been found.
p311_383|p311|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p311_395|p311|Nobody can take it away from me.
p311_381|p311|The replacements made a big difference.
p311_356|p311|I hope they will understand the reasons.
p311_342|p311|This is a big club.
p311_418|p311|I agree with them.
p311_197|p311|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p311_183|p311|He looked at me before replying.
p311_154|p311|We have the easy part.
p311_140|p311|It's a horrific incident.
p311_168|p311|The criteria have changed.
p311_020|p311|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311_034|p311|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p311_008|p311|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p311_222|p311|The professor said the results were positive.
p311_236|p311|He gets his moment.
p311_237|p311|This was an option from the beginning.
p311_223|p311|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p311_009|p311|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p311_035|p311|With actors it is slightly different.
p311_021|p311|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p311_169|p311|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p311_141|p311|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p311_155|p311|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p311_182|p311|It was entirely justified.
p311_196|p311|They were kept there for a summer.
p311_419|p311|I feel very strongly about that.
p311_343|p311|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p311_357|p311|They should have listened to me.
p311_380|p311|And it covers the spectrum.
p311_394|p311|They haven't run away.
p311_390|p311|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p311_384|p311|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p311_409|p311|I was furious about it.
p311_353|p311|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p311_421|p311|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p311_347|p311|I've no problem with what they said.
p311_192|p311|It is all credit to them today.
p311_186|p311|There will be no change in government.
p311_179|p311|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p311_151|p311|You just know it.
p311_145|p311|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p311_019|p311|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p311_025|p311|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p311_031|p311|Miller was every bit as happy.
p311_227|p311|Those Were The Days, indeed.
p311_233|p311|I came here this week to work.
p311_232|p311|We have to defend ourselves.
p311_226|p311|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p311_030|p311|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p311_024|p311|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p311_018|p311|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p311_144|p311|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p311_150|p311|The money is not really our concern.
p311_178|p311|I was delighted with every one of them.
p311_187|p311|Another man said, It was horrible.
p311_193|p311|I have done ever since it was published.
p311_420|p311|We will listen to colleagues.
p311_346|p311|It seemed so personal.
p311_352|p311|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311_408|p311|Are you watching Liverpool?
p311_385|p311|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p311_391|p311|I had to calm down.
p311_387|p311|My players are precious to me.
p311_393|p311|She returned home a few days later.
p311_378|p311|We have to start again on Saturday.
p311_344|p311|They will now get that support.
p311_422|p311|It's something we want to make work.
p311_350|p311|Eriksson would have approved.
p311_185|p311|It feels that the game is off.
p311_191|p311|I have no battle with the Scots.
p311_146|p311|They did not let him down.
p311_152|p311|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p311_032|p311|We keep a distance.
p311_026|p311|It's ahead of Labour.
p311_218|p311|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
p311_230|p311|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p311_224|p311|But it's just great to have won.
p311_225|p311|And it paid off.
p311_231|p311|They are just trying to cover up.
p311_219|p311|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p311_027|p311|It is the whole package.
p311_033|p311|She went home from school and never returned.
p311_153|p311|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p311_147|p311|I believe in trade unions.
p311_190|p311|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p311_184|p311|This may be perfectly innocent.
p311_351|p311|It is physical but it is also good.
p311_345|p311|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p311_423|p311|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p311_379|p311|It feels like a winner already.
p311_392|p311|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311_386|p311|There are big names.
p343_253|p343|There were too many mistakes.
p343_247|p343|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p343_092|p343|He's got the same story.
p343_086|p343|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p343_051|p343|I expect a rapid response.
p343_045|p343|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p343_079|p343|I am looking forward to getting home.
p343_125|p343|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p343_131|p343|The answer is maybe.
p343_119|p343|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343_327|p343|Everyone believes in it.
p343_333|p343|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p343_332|p343|That should give me a chance.
p343_326|p343|It is time, he said.
p343_118|p343|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p343_130|p343|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p343_124|p343|We reckon we can do very well.
p343_078|p343|They were at school together.
p343_044|p343|I had troubles with the producers.
p343_050|p343|It is a beautiful country.
p343_087|p343|No one was listening.
p343_093|p343|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p343_246|p343|He died later in hospital.
p343_252|p343|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p343_285|p343|I can feel the sound inside.
p343_291|p343|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343_287|p343|I believe in debate and dialogue.
p343_293|p343|I could not sit in the stands.
p343_244|p343|The weather forecast isn't good.
p343_250|p343|Actually, nothing much will change.
p343_278|p343|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p343_085|p343|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p343_091|p343|It's terrible that this is happening.
p343_046|p343|He died the following year.
p343_052|p343|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p343_132|p343|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p343_126|p343|It has been a great day.
p343_324|p343|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343_318|p343|We told them in August.
p343_319|p343|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p343_325|p343|Our thoughts are with her.
p343_331|p343|He was a one off.
p343_127|p343|We are not with you.
p343_133|p343|The referee had a shocking game.
p343_053|p343|This was never a support group.
p343_047|p343|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_090|p343|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p343_084|p343|I didn't understand it.
p343_279|p343|We are talking about one family.
p343_251|p343|We will turn the corner.
p343_245|p343|They have not been named.
p343_292|p343|The clarity is vital.
p343_286|p343|The answer is yes.
p343_282|p343|Everything is so new.
p343_296|p343|It makes no influence on the public.
p343_269|p343|People should make their own decisions.
p343_241|p343|We did not complete the process.
p343_255|p343|However, my position remains the same.
p343_080|p343|Painful, but only because it's true.
p343_094|p343|It is par for the course, of course.
p343_043|p343|We've all been here before.
p343_057|p343|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p343_137|p343|All the pressure will be on him.
p343_123|p343|Well, the big day has arrived.
p343_309|p343|A compromise is essential.
p343_335|p343|We played them off the pitch.
p343_321|p343|What on earth is happening to rugby?
p343_320|p343|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
p343_334|p343|It is my last chance.
p343_308|p343|They really shouldn't have put it out.
p343_122|p343|Why is that?
p343_136|p343|For a few years we had good fun.
p343_056|p343|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343_042|p343|That was the theory, anyway.
p343_095|p343|And so it goes on.
p343_081|p343|Once they go away they won't come back.
p343_254|p343|He says it often enough.
p343_240|p343|Is a drug dealer?
p343_268|p343|We are all suffering.
p343_297|p343|It's ahead of Labour.
p343_283|p343|It may take time to get it back.
p343_295|p343|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p343_281|p343|The error appeared in a warrant.
p343_256|p343|It was totally out of the blue.
p343_242|p343|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p343_097|p343|What was this?
p343_083|p343|That was the easy election.
p343_068|p343|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p343_054|p343|I must take a seat.
p343_040|p343|And you know something?
p343_108|p343|I've got to get noticed!
p343_120|p343|I cannot believe this decision.
p343_134|p343|I haven't been able to do it since.
p343_322|p343|It is now being examined.
p343_336|p343|The service from the other players was super.
p343_337|p343|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p343_323|p343|It is so out of character.
p343_135|p343|It's about doing things.
p343_121|p343|This decision is destroying my family.
p343_109|p343|Not that it was needed.
p343_041|p343|We were with him the whole time.
p343_055|p343|My mother is a widow.
p343_069|p343|It was just awful.
p343_082|p343|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p343_096|p343|The winner will be announced next month.
p343_243|p343|Where are you taking her?
p343_257|p343|Horses are not affected.
p343_280|p343|He is not a pathetic figure.
p343_294|p343|He had a decision to make.
p343_230|p343|You have a very persuasive president.
p343_224|p343|She is currently in foster care.
p343_218|p343|If he leaves, the band is finished.
p343_032|p343|But it might have done.
p343_026|p343|I'll go to the races.
p343_185|p343|Of course, there was still much to be done.
p343_191|p343|That tells you something.
p343_146|p343|I told that to the police.
p343_152|p343|It always had to be about the gym.
p343_387|p343|Because it's a secret.
p343_393|p343|You take a risk.
p343_344|p343|They will be up for it for sure.
p343_350|p343|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p343_378|p343|I have spoken to the skipper.
p343_379|p343|The call was ignored.
p343_351|p343|As a nation, we must become more active.
p343_345|p343|So you let me know.
p343_392|p343|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343_386|p343|They will have five minutes to decide.
p343_153|p343|Only one got through.
p343_147|p343|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
p343_190|p343|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p343_184|p343|Footage has been passed on to the police.
p343_027|p343|We will be back next year.
p343_033|p343|Nor is it likely to do so.
p343_219|p343|He saw it all as a big game.
p343_225|p343|That's the only thing that matters.
p343_231|p343|It's always the same, isn't it?
p343_227|p343|The service will only survive with change.
p343_233|p343|We could learn a lot from them.
p343_025|p343|I've got a long way to go.
p343_031|p343|Survival is our aim.
p343_019|p343|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p343_192|p343|It has been a magical moment.
p343_186|p343|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
p343_151|p343|He pleaded for caution.
p343_145|p343|We are not going to get carried away.
p343_179|p343|This has been very frustrating for him.
p343_390|p343|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p343_384|p343|That is the theory.
p343_353|p343|It is safe in our hands.
p343_347|p343|That will just be the beginning.
p343_346|p343|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p343_352|p343|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p343_385|p343|It almost certainly is.
p343_391|p343|They are there to help us.
p343_178|p343|I am looking forward to this film.
p343_144|p343|But not all were so defiant.
p343_150|p343|I'm going to win the gold.
p343_187|p343|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p343_193|p343|Is that not uncanny?
p343_018|p343|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p343_030|p343|People don't feel safe, including me.
p343_024|p343|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p343_232|p343|She has not returned to work.
p343_226|p343|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343_222|p343|That was never their agenda.
p343_236|p343|Men should avoid it like the plague.
p343_020|p343|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343_034|p343|What can you do?
p343_197|p343|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p343_183|p343|But experience is a wonderful thing.
p343_168|p343|He can do no wrong.
p343_154|p343|It's like a garage.
p343_140|p343|That was a good effort.
p343_395|p343|Each one is as good as the other.
p343_381|p343|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
p343_356|p343|It comes down to the police in England.
p343_342|p343|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
p343_343|p343|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
p343_357|p343|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p343_394|p343|Which he is, too.
p343_141|p343|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343_155|p343|They've been wonderful to me.
p343_169|p343|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p343_182|p343|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343_196|p343|These days are over.
p343_035|p343|I read it every year.
p343_021|p343|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p343_009|p343|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p343_237|p343|It's really good fun.
p343_223|p343|But he kept on repeating it.
p343_209|p343|Children also died in Britain.
p343_235|p343|The players are obviously keen to do well.
p343_221|p343|Here we have not had one hour.
p343_037|p343|It should be the reverse.
p343_023|p343|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p343_180|p343|The talking cannot go on too long.
p343_194|p343|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p343_143|p343|He had finally had enough.
p343_157|p343|I can't believe the buzz.
p343_382|p343|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p343_396|p343|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p343_369|p343|The warning was lifted late last night.
p343_341|p343|I started on fire a couple of times.
p343_355|p343|We will need to look at that.
p343_354|p343|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p343_340|p343|We're not comparing like with like.
p343_368|p343|He is a visionary.
p343_397|p343|I have hardly any commitments.
p343_383|p343|And there is another problem.
p343_142|p343|He must not be removed from office.
p343_195|p343|The hotel was huge.
p343_181|p343|I've got a young family.
p343_022|p343|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p343_036|p343|I go in for the parts.
p343_220|p343|I didn't actually work up a speech.
p343_234|p343|He is the saviour of South Africa.
p343_208|p343|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p343_211|p343|We want to get there.
p343_205|p343|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p343_239|p343|We are expecting a big crowd.
p343_013|p343|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p343_007|p343|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p343_198|p343|Well, you can have a tree.
p343_167|p343|Are his works inside out?
p343_173|p343|Is something which we just don't do.
p343_365|p343|We had to take action to protect them.
p343_371|p343|I have to take some of the blame.
p343_359|p343|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p343_358|p343|It is a gamble.
p343_370|p343|There is always the smell.
p343_364|p343|There's a hint of classical.
p343_172|p343|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p343_166|p343|His is a success story by any standard.
p343_199|p343|Or so it is hoped.
p343_006|p343|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p343_012|p343|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p343_238|p343|Our positions remains unchanged.
p343_204|p343|They made such decisions in London.
p343_210|p343|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p343_206|p343|I was influenced by all of these things.
p343_004|p343|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p343_010|p343|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p343_038|p343|We are a team of hard workers.
p343_170|p343|Do they have to create seven majors?
p343_164|p343|Staff have been informed.
p343_158|p343|It is a traffic warden.
p343_399|p343|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p343_372|p343|And if he hasn't become a musician?
p343_366|p343|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343_400|p343|I love the feel of the place.
p343_367|p343|In the end, however, it all came together.
p343_398|p343|There is no formula.
p343_159|p343|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p343_165|p343|It is one of those things.
p343_171|p343|It has been handled entirely properly.
p343_039|p343|It is up to Ann.
p343_011|p343|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p343_005|p343|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p343_213|p343|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343_207|p343|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p343_203|p343|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343_217|p343|This was not a summit about the euro.
p343_029|p343|It is a crucial award.
p343_001|p343|Please call Stella.
p343_015|p343|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p343_149|p343|But when we do it it is great.
p343_175|p343|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p343_161|p343|That never came to court as a charge.
p343_388|p343|My wife and family are the support system.
p343_377|p343|He took away my childhood.
p343_363|p343|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p343_362|p343|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p343_376|p343|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
p343_389|p343|The body follows the mind.
p343_160|p343|It had been played at festivals.
p343_174|p343|That began as an accident.
p343_148|p343|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p343_014|p343|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343_028|p343|I was very, very pleased with our display.
p343_216|p343|He has the edge.
p343_202|p343|This is an internal matter.
p343_228|p343|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p343_214|p343|He said he would appeal the sentences.
p343_016|p343|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343_002|p343|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p343_189|p343|She really suffered for her art.
p343_162|p343|Dancing was her life.
p343_176|p343|He will want to utilise the midfield.
p343_348|p343|No one can say that about me.
p343_360|p343|The tribunal continues today.
p343_374|p343|He is lying to save his skin.
p343_375|p343|You have to do your research.
p343_361|p343|These things have not happened by accident.
p343_349|p343|That had not happened on this occasion.
p343_177|p343|Two others were also seriously injured.
p343_163|p343|The latter way is my way.
p343_188|p343|It was good today.
p343_003|p343|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p343_201|p343|He said to give a local injection.
p343_215|p343|The hearing was fair.
p343_229|p343|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p343_299|p343|I was totally wrong.
p343_266|p343|As, indeed, they would be.
p343_070|p343|That is really all.
p343_064|p343|He has really done well.
p343_058|p343|The matter will come up again.
p343_104|p343|And we have beaten them before.
p343_110|p343|It's up to them to decide.
p343_306|p343|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p343_312|p343|It was not a cover-up.
p343_313|p343|The children continue to talk to us.
p343_307|p343|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343_139|p343|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p343_111|p343|But we can't have a casino.
p343_105|p343|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p343_059|p343|I don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_065|p343|I'm just delighted to take it.
p343_071|p343|We played too deeply.
p343_267|p343|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p343_273|p343|Again, we were lucky.
p343_298|p343|It's the whole package.
p343_265|p343|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p343_271|p343|I knew people on that committee.
p343_259|p343|I'm not going to change from it.
p343_098|p343|I am not a fan of books.
p343_067|p343|Funding needs to be long term.
p343_073|p343|I am ready to go.
p343_113|p343|The odds are that it will.
p343_107|p343|I am not a paedophile.
p343_311|p343|They need to be involved.
p343_339|p343|You have been warned.
p343_338|p343|He didn't let me down.
p343_304|p343|Is it the flight?
p343_310|p343|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p343_106|p343|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p343_112|p343|I would love to play in Europe again.
p343_072|p343|We could have got three medals.
p343_066|p343|This happened on three days inside a week.
p343_099|p343|It may well have been.
p343_258|p343|It went on forever.
p343_270|p343|That is a question for the next manager.
p343_264|p343|There is no room for error.
p343_248|p343|He had a great game.
p343_260|p343|And they are different.
p343_274|p343|There was no argument.
p343_089|p343|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p343_062|p343|But that's another story for another day.
p343_076|p343|We are at the crossroads.
p343_116|p343|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p343_102|p343|I am not a doctor.
p343_328|p343|We must learn to finish.
p343_314|p343|You know the sort of thing.
p343_300|p343|This has got to stop.
p343_301|p343|It was a matter of chance.
p343_315|p343|I cannot say too much about them.
p343_103|p343|It is all in the mind.
p343_117|p343|He also has property interests in the country.
p343_077|p343|I am about protecting the state pension.
p343_063|p343|One thing is sure.
p343_088|p343|I will report in the spring.
p343_275|p343|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343_261|p343|It would have been very easily done.
p343_249|p343|It's still got that at its heart.
p343_288|p343|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p343_277|p343|I just need a bit of luck.
p343_263|p343|That idea is rubbish.
p343_049|p343|I have no doubt about that.
p343_075|p343|The script was funny.
p343_061|p343|He should be a great asset.
p343_129|p343|If so, they were wrong.
p343_101|p343|We can only go up.
p343_115|p343|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p343_303|p343|It is a real concern.
p343_317|p343|I will work on her.
p343_316|p343|She went home from school and never returned.
p343_302|p343|There is no point of looking any further.
p343_114|p343|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p343_100|p343|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
p343_128|p343|Then came the crunch.
p343_060|p343|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_074|p343|We are still suffering from that.
p343_048|p343|He is trying really hard.
p343_262|p343|He knows the course.
p343_276|p343|She is a valuable member of Government.
p343_289|p343|That is a personal matter.
p310_167|p310|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p310_371|p310|Pray that is so.
p310_417|p310|I want a free vote.
p310_403|p310|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p310_365|p310|Their mind was already made up.
p310_359|p310|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p310_205|p310|They will want to watch a winning team.
p310_211|p310|He is a Satan.
p310_239|p310|It's a difficult job.
p310_007|p310|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p310_013|p310|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p310_012|p310|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p310_006|p310|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p310_238|p310|Last year was not a good year.
p310_210|p310|One must hope not!
p310_204|p310|What is the truth about the cow?
p310_358|p310|This is the lowest of the low.
p310_402|p310|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p310_364|p310|It is a decision which has paid off.
p310_370|p310|Alex is a big part of that future.
p310_416|p310|They've been here before.
p310_166|p310|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p310_172|p310|His track record is not promising.
p310_199|p310|Or so we have long assumed.
p310_164|p310|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p310_170|p310|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
p310_158|p310|This can only help us go forward.
p310_399|p310|The issue has still to be resolved.
p310_366|p310|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p310_400|p310|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p310_414|p310|Who has he fought?
p310_372|p310|In fact it isn't related to either.
p310_212|p310|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p310_206|p310|I think it's awful.
p310_010|p310|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p310_004|p310|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p310_038|p310|We're still talking with a few people.
p310_039|p310|But one shouldn't go by that.
p310_005|p310|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p310_011|p310|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p310_207|p310|Who is going to be penalised?
p310_213|p310|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p310_415|p310|The film is about the cost of genius.
p310_373|p310|There was support from across the board.
p310_367|p310|But it's got to be worth it.
p310_401|p310|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p310_398|p310|My father died in childbirth.
p310_159|p310|It's never the same problem.
p310_171|p310|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p310_165|p310|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p310_149|p310|I felt under no pressure today.
p310_161|p310|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p310_175|p310|However, you have just got to adjust it.
p310_388|p310|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p310_405|p310|And that started me thinking.
p310_363|p310|I love the moment of being first.
p310_377|p310|Such actions are rarely popular.
p310_411|p310|We have high hopes that this will work.
p310_217|p310|There was no cohesion.
p310_203|p310|But first it goes out on TV.
p310_029|p310|Did you see that?
p310_015|p310|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310_001|p310|Please call Stella.
p310_014|p310|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p310_028|p310|It feels like a winner already.
p310_202|p310|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p310_216|p310|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p310_376|p310|So what does one do?
p310_410|p310|This will help our confidence.
p310_404|p310|We were close, but not close enough.
p310_362|p310|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p310_389|p310|I never agreed with that.
p310_174|p310|He put a lot of effort into it.
p310_160|p310|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p310_148|p310|Each one has its own system.
p310_189|p310|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p310_176|p310|That was moving the goalposts.
p310_162|p310|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p310_348|p310|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p310_412|p310|They also have good neighbours.
p310_374|p310|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p310_360|p310|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p310_406|p310|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p310_228|p310|Things are moving together.
p310_200|p310|They responded with victories.
p310_214|p310|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p310_002|p310|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p310_016|p310|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310_017|p310|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p310_003|p310|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p310_215|p310|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p310_201|p310|That was the personal impulse.
p310_229|p310|I get to work with very good people.
p310_361|p310|He's a nice guy.
p310_407|p310|It brings together two essential elements.
p310_413|p310|People ask about the concept of a team.
p310_375|p310|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p310_349|p310|He showed he has some things to learn.
p310_163|p310|I was over the moon.
p310_177|p310|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p310_188|p310|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p310_110|p310|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p310_104|p310|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p310_138|p310|What's the rush?
p310_312|p310|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p310_306|p310|This is not a faceless system.
p310_299|p310|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p310_266|p310|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p310_272|p310|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p310_064|p310|We shall not do that.
p310_070|p310|We're not the tourist board.
p310_058|p310|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p310_059|p310|This is the band.
p310_071|p310|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p310_065|p310|I have had no social life at all.
p310_273|p310|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p310_267|p310|It's such a trial!
p310_298|p310|We had no part in it.
p310_307|p310|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p310_313|p310|What, then, is the real thing?
p310_139|p310|The starting point is pretty unusual.
p310_105|p310|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p310_111|p310|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p310_107|p310|Or, rather, it isn't.
p310_113|p310|But there is another side.
p310_305|p310|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p310_311|p310|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p310_339|p310|You need a reason for staying.
p310_271|p310|It was also put on the Internet.
p310_265|p310|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p310_259|p310|That could be at least five years away.
p310_098|p310|I don't know how it happened.
p310_073|p310|The Commons is too outdated.
p310_067|p310|Once again, he refused.
p310_066|p310|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310_072|p310|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p310_099|p310|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p310_258|p310|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p310_264|p310|We have not given up hope.
p310_270|p310|And a film maker was born.
p310_338|p310|We don't know the scale of need.
p310_310|p310|The damage from the fire was huge.
p310_304|p310|That would have been too easy.
p310_112|p310|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p310_106|p310|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p310_102|p310|We shall rely on human beings.
p310_116|p310|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p310_328|p310|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p310_300|p310|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p310_314|p310|Boarding school was equally protective.
p310_248|p310|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
p310_274|p310|It seems to have worked.
p310_260|p310|That is my role.
p310_089|p310|She may even appear in some more films.
p310_076|p310|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p310_062|p310|We're into that build-up now.
p310_063|p310|It is the end of an era.
p310_077|p310|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310_088|p310|However, it is no longer with the national team.
p310_261|p310|He also presented You Bet!
p310_275|p310|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p310_249|p310|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p310_315|p310|Most people know that.
p310_301|p310|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p310_329|p310|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p310_117|p310|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p310_103|p310|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
p310_129|p310|We stopped at half-time.
p310_115|p310|There is no guarantee.
p310_101|p310|Construction is due to begin in February.
p310_317|p310|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
p310_303|p310|And there is no cause for it.
p310_288|p310|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p310_263|p310|It really is taken seriously.
p310_277|p310|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p310_049|p310|They had four children together.
p310_061|p310|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p310_075|p310|That was then and this is now.
p310_074|p310|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p310_060|p310|She has a wonderful mind.
p310_048|p310|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310_276|p310|There was a battle there.
p310_262|p310|That's the day job.
p310_289|p310|He must have something up his sleeve.
p310_302|p310|Our young people are leaving.
p310_316|p310|It will be the final push.
p310_100|p310|After that nothing could save him.
p310_114|p310|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p310_128|p310|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p310_131|p310|David was not either.
p310_125|p310|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p310_119|p310|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p310_333|p310|The South African defended his work ethic.
p310_327|p310|The goal will stay with me forever.
p310_284|p310|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p310_290|p310|He was at home with his pals.
p310_247|p310|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p310_253|p310|I was happiest with my short game.
p310_086|p310|Journalists should make him.
p310_092|p310|I don't know why she is not here.
p310_045|p310|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p310_051|p310|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310_079|p310|He would be with his peers.
p310_078|p310|Are you watching Liverpool?
p310_050|p310|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310_044|p310|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p310_093|p310|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p310_087|p310|I believe we have a good chance.
p310_252|p310|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p310_246|p310|And thought we would get away with it.
p310_291|p310|We make good weapons.
p310_285|p310|I have learned a lot from him.
p310_326|p310|Nelson does not disappoint.
p310_332|p310|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p310_118|p310|It may be argued.
p310_124|p310|Five in a month isn't good enough.
p310_130|p310|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p310_126|p310|This is just one example.
p310_132|p310|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p310_324|p310|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p310_330|p310|It is a high time to act.
p310_318|p310|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p310_293|p310|This is not a Scottish problem.
p310_287|p310|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p310_250|p310|I would urge the Government to think again.
p310_244|p310|He saw it all as a big game.
p310_278|p310|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p310_091|p310|He also called in at another farm.
p310_085|p310|This avalanche is just beginning.
p310_052|p310|I fell to the ground.
p310_046|p310|And who would argue with that?
p310_047|p310|I hope you will leave it at that.
p310_053|p310|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p310_084|p310|I am so sorry.
p310_090|p310|This is the best moment of my career.
p310_279|p310|Today's ruling confirms that.
p310_245|p310|They are not an item.
p310_251|p310|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p310_286|p310|Is he any good in the kitchen?
p310_292|p310|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p310_319|p310|The campaign was raucous.
p310_331|p310|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p310_325|p310|There is no threat to them.
p310_133|p310|We don't see it as downgrading.
p310_127|p310|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p310_123|p310|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p310_137|p310|People can describe a moment in their life.
p310_309|p310|It is just like the stock market.
p310_321|p310|But both were involved with other matters.
p310_335|p310|There was barely a handful of chances.
p310_296|p310|That was the most annoying thing.
p310_282|p310|I'd never heard him in person before.
p310_269|p310|I think it is totally wrong.
p310_255|p310|We went on to become very successful.
p310_241|p310|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p310_094|p310|I agree with them.
p310_080|p310|They seem to be backing off from that.
p310_057|p310|All of us know it exists.
p310_043|p310|That argument has been won.
p310_042|p310|There are big names.
p310_056|p310|How can they engage with the work?
p310_081|p310|But it took a lot of bottle.
p310_095|p310|I feel very strongly about that.
p310_240|p310|We can't get over it.
p310_254|p310|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p310_268|p310|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p310_283|p310|We're going to change our party.
p310_297|p310|We are being hijacked.
p310_334|p310|We have a team to reach the final.
p310_320|p310|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p310_308|p310|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p310_136|p310|He is dying from cancer.
p310_122|p310|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p310_108|p310|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p310_134|p310|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p310_120|p310|I bought a car at auction.
p310_336|p310|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p310_322|p310|But we were wrong.
p310_281|p310|THE atmosphere was electric.
p310_295|p310|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p310_242|p310|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p310_256|p310|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p310_083|p310|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p310_097|p310|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p310_068|p310|This is about the Orange Order.
p310_040|p310|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p310_054|p310|They were not defeated.
p310_055|p310|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p310_041|p310|Buying our way out is not an option.
p310_069|p310|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p310_096|p310|Now he will have to start again.
p310_082|p310|They don't work anymore anyway.
p310_257|p310|No, is the answer to your first question.
p310_243|p310|This represents a tough game for us.
p310_294|p310|Then followed a bout of flu.
p310_280|p310|It's good news and long overdue.
p310_323|p310|The result today is an impasse.
p310_337|p310|I have found my vision.
p310_121|p310|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p310_135|p310|No date has been set for the appeal.
p310_109|p310|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p310_191|p310|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
p310_185|p310|There was even a joke.
p310_152|p310|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p310_146|p310|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p310_393|p310|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p310_387|p310|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310_350|p310|Or do they?
p310_422|p310|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p310_344|p310|The big issue for us is the review.
p310_378|p310|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p310_224|p310|Some of his family still live there.
p310_230|p310|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p310_218|p310|He was jailed for five years.
p310_026|p310|I fell in love with the ballet.
p310_032|p310|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p310_033|p310|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p310_027|p310|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p310_219|p310|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p310_231|p310|He must not be removed from office.
p310_225|p310|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p310_379|p310|That is why it's so lyrical.
p310_423|p310|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p310_345|p310|That is not the way we should operate.
p310_351|p310|They are the innocent victims.
p310_386|p310|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p310_392|p310|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310_147|p310|I've so much respect for him.
p310_153|p310|This is a job for the Government.
p310_190|p310|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p310_186|p310|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p310_192|p310|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p310_145|p310|Is that too much to ask?
p310_151|p310|And that was the adults.
p310_179|p310|The club are feeling no different today.
p310_384|p310|And they all had these other commitments.
p310_390|p310|I didn't actually believe them at first.
p310_347|p310|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p310_421|p310|So he should be.
p310_353|p310|That is of no use.
p310_409|p310|We had a reunion last week.
p310_233|p310|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p310_227|p310|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p310_031|p310|And the winners are.
p310_025|p310|He was the youngest of the British team.
p310_019|p310|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p310_018|p310|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p310_024|p310|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p310_030|p310|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p310_226|p310|However, it very nearly went wrong.
p310_232|p310|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p310_408|p310|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p310_352|p310|It is now time for justice.
p310_346|p310|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
p310_420|p310|I think it's a disgrace.
p310_391|p310|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p310_385|p310|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p310_178|p310|We have the location, which is assured.
p310_150|p310|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p310_144|p310|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p310_193|p310|It is too early to speculate.
p310_187|p310|This guy is never going to give up.
p310_183|p310|We couldn't go very fast.
p310_197|p310|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p310_168|p310|And then came the seventies.
p310_140|p310|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p310_154|p310|I felt the head was very like me.
p310_381|p310|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p310_395|p310|I don't think it's vital.
p310_418|p310|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p310_424|p310|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p310_342|p310|I don't expect to see that this time.
p310_356|p310|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p310_236|p310|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p310_222|p310|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p310_008|p310|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p310_034|p310|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p310_020|p310|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p310_021|p310|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p310_035|p310|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p310_009|p310|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p310_223|p310|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p310_237|p310|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p310_357|p310|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
p310_343|p310|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p310_419|p310|It would show them a positive way forward.
p310_394|p310|There was only one hole in it.
p310_380|p310|I joined a group.
p310_155|p310|We started with that.
p310_141|p310|They receive a high profile in the media.
p310_169|p310|I guess it is down to focus.
p310_196|p310|I will wait until later.
p310_182|p310|I'm not a magician.
p310_194|p310|I just had so much fun.
p310_180|p310|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p310_157|p310|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p310_143|p310|I think this proposal is excellent.
p310_396|p310|It might not survive the process.
p310_382|p310|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p310_369|p310|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p310_355|p310|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310_341|p310|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p310_209|p310|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p310_221|p310|We will look into it.
p310_235|p310|This film will be totally awesome.
p310_023|p310|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p310_037|p310|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p310_036|p310|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p310_022|p310|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p310_234|p310|Look at the table.
p310_220|p310|We will not break even.
p310_208|p310|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p310_340|p310|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p310_354|p310|I could have been offended.
p310_368|p310|But does the same thing happen with music?
p310_383|p310|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p310_397|p310|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p310_142|p310|It was an ambush.
p310_156|p310|And he had much need.
p310_181|p310|I see the extended family once a year.
p310_195|p310|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p317_319|p317|So he is open to ideas.
p317_133|p317|They too refused to come out and talk.
p317_127|p317|Hear what they have to say.
p317_047|p317|We then went to see the headmaster.
p317_053|p317|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p317_084|p317|This has not, and has been neglected.
p317_090|p317|There is no signature on this document.
p317_245|p317|I now know that from memory.
p317_251|p317|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p317_279|p317|There's not much money in cycling.
p317_286|p317|Blood samples were taken.
p317_292|p317|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p317_293|p317|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p317_287|p317|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p317_278|p317|The bookies have got it about right.
p317_250|p317|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p317_244|p317|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p317_091|p317|We could not compete with Rangers.
p317_085|p317|McNaughton was not so sure.
p317_052|p317|Are we going to stay up?
p317_046|p317|I would think they are just behind them.
p317_126|p317|A decision is expected shortly.
p317_132|p317|I think it is wide open.
p317_318|p317|In fact, it might just be beginning.
p317_324|p317|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p317_330|p317|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p317_326|p317|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
p317_332|p317|The effect was almost magical.
p317_124|p317|There was no confusion over the second.
p317_130|p317|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p317_118|p317|Players were held in equally low regard.
p317_050|p317|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p317_044|p317|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p317_078|p317|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p317_093|p317|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p317_087|p317|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p317_252|p317|You are not going in blind.
p317_246|p317|We need to tighten up.
p317_291|p317|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p317_285|p317|He also has a house in Italy.
p317_284|p317|And that is not a bad idea.
p317_290|p317|They are in care for a reason.
p317_247|p317|I saw it at a ruck.
p317_253|p317|They just made me feel dizzy.
p317_086|p317|What did you learn in school today?
p317_092|p317|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p317_079|p317|I played well but missed a few chances.
p317_045|p317|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p317_051|p317|These men are a part of India.
p317_119|p317|I was in the train station overnight.
p317_131|p317|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
p317_125|p317|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p317_333|p317|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p317_327|p317|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p317_323|p317|We are expected to do better than before.
p317_337|p317|I was not a joiner.
p317_109|p317|We understand the changes in the world.
p317_121|p317|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p317_135|p317|It is important that vital services are maintained.
p317_069|p317|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p317_055|p317|New potential dangers were emerging.
p317_041|p317|Overall, however, these were also down.
p317_096|p317|One season, they might do well.
p317_082|p317|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317_257|p317|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p317_243|p317|It's like English in its underwear.
p317_294|p317|It got no better.
p317_280|p317|It was always open for extension.
p317_281|p317|I think we're very different.
p317_295|p317|I keep my fingers crossed.
p317_242|p317|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p317_256|p317|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p317_083|p317|That would open the gates of hell.
p317_097|p317|Our approach will be different.
p317_040|p317|The gaffer was great.
p317_054|p317|I am going home to see my children.
p317_068|p317|It is an attitude of mind.
p317_134|p317|We took the chances when they came.
p317_120|p317|It's to do with context.
p317_108|p317|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p317_336|p317|She was charged with perjury.
p317_322|p317|There is no right to appeal.
p317_308|p317|This is a dream come true for me.
p317_334|p317|We are not doing the Today programme.
p317_320|p317|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p317_136|p317|These services may also have to be cut.
p317_122|p317|Our home is your home.
p317_042|p317|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p317_056|p317|That tells you something about them.
p317_081|p317|I'm so proud of my team.
p317_095|p317|However, it is much bigger than that.
p317_268|p317|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
p317_240|p317|For example they could be in school uniform.
p317_254|p317|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p317_283|p317|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p317_297|p317|It would then be up to the judge.
p317_296|p317|Some were close to tears.
p317_282|p317|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p317_255|p317|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p317_241|p317|Surely the panel was interested?
p317_269|p317|Do you want a cup of tea.
p317_094|p317|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p317_080|p317|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p317_057|p317|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p317_043|p317|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p317_123|p317|It is essential that we win the game.
p317_137|p317|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p317_321|p317|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p317_335|p317|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
p317_309|p317|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p317_352|p317|There's no doubt about it.
p317_346|p317|A decision is expected next March.
p317_420|p317|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p317_408|p317|That's the law of the land.
p317_391|p317|This looks like it is anything but open.
p317_385|p317|But he has strong links to Labour.
p317_150|p317|We never got off the bus.
p317_144|p317|They never looked like winning it either.
p317_178|p317|A lot of things can go wrong.
p317_193|p317|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p317_187|p317|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p317_024|p317|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p317_030|p317|The council has been open and transparent.
p317_018|p317|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p317_226|p317|Clubs can only do so much.
p317_232|p317|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p317_233|p317|I don't care to recall it.
p317_227|p317|It's unsafe for society.
p317_019|p317|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p317_031|p317|Is the war over?
p317_025|p317|They have the cash to do that.
p317_186|p317|Aye, but who do you really support?
p317_192|p317|He said that this is beautiful.
p317_179|p317|I was delighted with Robbie.
p317_145|p317|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
p317_151|p317|The driver escaped injury.
p317_384|p317|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p317_390|p317|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p317_409|p317|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p317_347|p317|We don't believe anything anymore.
p317_421|p317|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
p317_353|p317|It just came into my head that day.
p317_423|p317|Manchester United are the classic example.
p317_345|p317|That never seemed likely.
p317_351|p317|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p317_379|p317|It's a hidden problem.
p317_386|p317|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p317_392|p317|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p317_147|p317|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p317_153|p317|They should be looking at his victims.
p317_184|p317|The police were called in.
p317_190|p317|It's a drop in the bucket.
p317_033|p317|But don't expect an easy ride.
p317_027|p317|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p317_231|p317|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p317_225|p317|I can't deny that fact.
p317_219|p317|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p317_218|p317|We were a load of rubbish.
p317_224|p317|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p317_230|p317|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p317_026|p317|There was a fine line to tread.
p317_032|p317|The country is in a state of chaos.
p317_191|p317|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p317_185|p317|The group would never be the same again.
p317_152|p317|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p317_146|p317|No details of the talks were given.
p317_393|p317|She kept him on a string.
p317_387|p317|I never thought it would take this long.
p317_378|p317|We talk to each other about these matters.
p317_350|p317|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p317_422|p317|Appointments should be made on merit.
p317_344|p317|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p317_368|p317|And he goes with it.
p317_340|p317|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p317_354|p317|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p317_383|p317|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p317_397|p317|What's the theme?
p317_142|p317|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p317_156|p317|I won't make an official complaint.
p317_181|p317|I'll just do my best.
p317_195|p317|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p317_036|p317|It was a policy they were against.
p317_022|p317|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p317_208|p317|Would he be able to live with that?
p317_234|p317|That's the whole idea.
p317_220|p317|I haven't made the donation yet.
p317_221|p317|Other people also tried.
p317_235|p317|They showed a lot of heart.
p317_209|p317|However, what is his calibre?
p317_023|p317|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p317_037|p317|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p317_194|p317|That option cannot be ruled out.
p317_180|p317|He seemed to lose his focus.
p317_157|p317|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p317_143|p317|MOVIE stars are public property.
p317_396|p317|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p317_382|p317|I lost a part of me.
p317_355|p317|What's a boy to do?
p317_341|p317|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p317_369|p317|The actors just have to say so.
p317_419|p317|Neither side can win this war.
p317_357|p317|The other was the tabloids.
p317_343|p317|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p317_394|p317|The committees are due to report next year.
p317_380|p317|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p317_169|p317|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p317_155|p317|It's all about money, money, money.
p317_141|p317|Who honestly expected anything else?
p317_196|p317|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p317_182|p317|Three penalties were given.
p317_009|p317|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p317_021|p317|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p317_035|p317|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p317_223|p317|He is at war with his knee.
p317_237|p317|My life is a mess.
p317_236|p317|Michael, he is running!
p317_222|p317|But Harry has become a franchise.
p317_034|p317|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p317_020|p317|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p317_008|p317|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p317_183|p317|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p317_197|p317|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p317_140|p317|Actors stand still in the frame.
p317_154|p317|We told them in June.
p317_168|p317|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p317_381|p317|There will be two other areas of contention.
p317_395|p317|It's a long-term solution.
p317_342|p317|They were average apart, together superb.
p317_356|p317|We're not an employment agency.
p317_418|p317|She was extremely rigid.
p317_415|p317|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p317_373|p317|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p317_367|p317|That meant the search was unlawful.
p317_401|p317|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p317_398|p317|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p317_171|p317|This is excellent value for money.
p317_165|p317|There was an e-mail.
p317_159|p317|She is a double victim.
p317_005|p317|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p317_011|p317|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p317_039|p317|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p317_207|p317|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p317_213|p317|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p317_212|p317|It's a production company.
p317_206|p317|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p317_038|p317|We see little sign of improvement.
p317_010|p317|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p317_004|p317|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p317_158|p317|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p317_164|p317|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p317_170|p317|It is no place for a poet.
p317_399|p317|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p317_366|p317|We could easily be cut again.
p317_400|p317|It's a very special unit.
p317_414|p317|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p317_372|p317|It broke up my marriage.
p317_402|p317|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p317_364|p317|I am very happy to be here.
p317_370|p317|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p317_416|p317|This was not the show for me.
p317_358|p317|They should be swept away.
p317_166|p317|That is a lot of writing.
p317_172|p317|Each day is a new beginning.
p317_199|p317|That's how she wants to remember him.
p317_012|p317|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p317_006|p317|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p317_210|p317|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p317_204|p317|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p317_238|p317|He did not report it.
p317_239|p317|You must be ready to play anyone.
p317_205|p317|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p317_211|p317|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p317_007|p317|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p317_013|p317|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p317_198|p317|Three years probation is just a joke.
p317_173|p317|My daughter is an adult.
p317_167|p317|I try to be open to experience.
p317_359|p317|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p317_371|p317|I am so lucky for that.
p317_417|p317|The police have to act to help them.
p317_403|p317|However, the groups denied the claims.
p317_365|p317|He would help me with the form.
p317_349|p317|There was no need for such a hostel.
p317_361|p317|We want to replicate that success.
p317_407|p317|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p317_413|p317|The parents will have a great time, too.
p317_375|p317|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p317_163|p317|I am totally devoted to this job.
p317_177|p317|We've come from a long way back.
p317_188|p317|This is not a birthday party.
p317_017|p317|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p317_003|p317|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p317_229|p317|It would have very little impact on them.
p317_215|p317|They do the work, you know.
p317_201|p317|Who is the employer?
p317_200|p317|How do you respond to losing your child?
p317_214|p317|She died in middle age.
p317_228|p317|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p317_002|p317|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p317_016|p317|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p317_189|p317|This makes no sense!
p317_176|p317|Thereafter he left Scotland.
p317_162|p317|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p317_412|p317|Then one night only three people turn up.
p317_374|p317|The minister is the engineer.
p317_360|p317|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p317_406|p317|They will have to cut through the roof.
p317_348|p317|I am awaiting a reply.
p317_376|p317|I think it was briefly considered.
p317_410|p317|What's wrong with that?
p317_404|p317|It's only tackling congestion.
p317_362|p317|We were lucky to have survived.
p317_389|p317|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p317_148|p317|It was a wilful act of violence.
p317_174|p317|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p317_160|p317|How can you not react?
p317_028|p317|It is so elusive and light.
p317_014|p317|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p317_202|p317|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p317_216|p317|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p317_217|p317|We are in the hat.
p317_203|p317|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p317_015|p317|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p317_001|p317|Please call Stella.
p317_029|p317|I am not a fan of stoppages.
p317_161|p317|They make a selective perception process.
p317_175|p317|They are difficult awards to decide.
p317_149|p317|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p317_388|p317|And he is immensely loyal.
p317_405|p317|And our game is about going forward.
p317_363|p317|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p317_377|p317|And Rangers think they have problems.
p317_411|p317|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
p317_310|p317|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p317_304|p317|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p317_338|p317|The sleeper was six hours late.
p317_112|p317|That just wasn't good enough.
p317_106|p317|We have got the school holidays on.
p317_066|p317|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p317_072|p317|This is not an optional extra.
p317_099|p317|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p317_264|p317|It will be an eye for an eye.
p317_270|p317|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p317_258|p317|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p317_259|p317|We have great confidence in Derek.
p317_271|p317|We have all been shocked by her death.
p317_265|p317|Whatever happened to that one?
p317_098|p317|Too much has already been said.
p317_073|p317|This is not the most crucial issue.
p317_067|p317|Wagner was never like this.
p317_107|p317|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p317_113|p317|The company has other problems with the shells.
p317_339|p317|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p317_305|p317|It could have been just a quick fix.
p317_311|p317|He was lying face down in the water.
p317_307|p317|That has given me great confidence.
p317_313|p317|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p317_105|p317|His handling raises a wider issue.
p317_111|p317|This is the big one.
p317_139|p317|We can't have it both ways.
p317_071|p317|I've come here for the jersey.
p317_065|p317|They are the partner of choice for anyone.
p317_059|p317|I've had to take time off work today.
p317_273|p317|We are committed to urgent action.
p317_267|p317|I have spoken to head office.
p317_298|p317|Was all this really just five months ago?
p317_299|p317|Some reports said they had been killed.
p317_266|p317|There were no proposals on the table.
p317_272|p317|We are asking the council to think again.
p317_058|p317|I am a drug addict.
p317_064|p317|They say he wants to go to England.
p317_070|p317|And what does it cost, and who is paying?
p317_138|p317|The captaincy will help that, too.
p317_110|p317|It is a potential factor.
p317_104|p317|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p317_312|p317|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p317_306|p317|I got on very well with Allan.
p317_302|p317|The failings are serious.
p317_316|p317|I was in the zone in the morning.
p317_128|p317|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p317_100|p317|But don't worry just yet.
p317_114|p317|The working families tax credit is far better.
p317_048|p317|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
p317_074|p317|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
p317_060|p317|The problem is the book.
p317_276|p317|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p317_262|p317|There were no new cases yesterday.
p317_289|p317|It's so creative and different.
p317_288|p317|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p317_263|p317|If only the problems concerned the players.
p317_277|p317|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p317_061|p317|There was no basis for their arrest.
p317_075|p317|It's that sort of night.
p317_049|p317|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p317_115|p317|He had done his homework properly.
p317_101|p317|This championship is different from the other majors.
p317_129|p317|You would be wrong.
p317_317|p317|He urged people to forgive.
p317_303|p317|It is like a bereavement.
p317_329|p317|I feel it is very irrational.
p317_315|p317|They didn't have a care in the world.
p317_301|p317|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p317_117|p317|We must get the three points.
p317_103|p317|I drove the ball well.
p317_063|p317|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p317_077|p317|Will we ever play together again?
p317_088|p317|We will see how he is after treatment.
p317_249|p317|Just get on with your job.
p317_261|p317|We are not too surprised.
p317_275|p317|I am totally surprised.
p317_274|p317|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p317_260|p317|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p317_248|p317|This is a huge event.
p317_089|p317|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
p317_076|p317|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p317_062|p317|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p317_102|p317|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p317_116|p317|Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
p317_300|p317|This is the start of a new campaign.
p317_314|p317|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p317_328|p317|It is good for their eyesight.
p326_171|p326|Tourism continues to struggle.
p326_398|p326|Then he did it twice.
p326_367|p326|We're not travel agents.
p326_373|p326|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p326_213|p326|After that he became more romantic.
p326_207|p326|I came into this world with nothing.
p326_039|p326|There is nothing like this back home.
p326_011|p326|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p326_005|p326|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p326_004|p326|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p326_010|p326|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p326_038|p326|She didn't tell us anything new.
p326_206|p326|In the old days, it was easy.
p326_212|p326|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p326_372|p326|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p326_366|p326|Finally action had been taken.
p326_400|p326|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p326_399|p326|So is the rest of British sport.
p326_170|p326|The threat to rural areas is real.
p326_164|p326|But it's a subtle process.
p326_158|p326|It's not just a male agenda.
p326_199|p326|Everyone knew where they were.
p326_172|p326|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p326_166|p326|There is no internal damage.
p326_358|p326|Labour is providing none of these.
p326_370|p326|I'm desperate to play in this match.
p326_364|p326|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p326_238|p326|I'm happy with the outcome.
p326_204|p326|Was this a new event?
p326_210|p326|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p326_006|p326|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p326_012|p326|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p326_013|p326|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p326_007|p326|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p326_211|p326|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p326_205|p326|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p326_239|p326|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p326_371|p326|That's always the case, isn't it?
p326_359|p326|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p326_167|p326|About the bad things that happened to me.
p326_173|p326|Its first awards will do just that.
p326_198|p326|These people just lost their child.
p326_188|p326|I want to be there by right.
p326_177|p326|The Scottish management team will settle for that.
p326_163|p326|It's always a rehearsal.
p326_375|p326|They did not threaten anyone.
p326_361|p326|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p326_349|p326|He was on a horse.
p326_201|p326|It was worth a photograph.
p326_215|p326|My view has now completely changed.
p326_229|p326|We are going to go about our lives.
p326_003|p326|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p326_017|p326|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p326_016|p326|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p326_002|p326|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p326_228|p326|No-one should see that.
p326_214|p326|It's not long enough.
p326_200|p326|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p326_348|p326|I can't see him reversing that.
p326_360|p326|There is no musical background in his family.
p326_374|p326|It is patently true.
p326_162|p326|How do you find the youngsters?
p326_176|p326|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p326_189|p326|The fund has three elements.
p326_160|p326|I think we believed the tie was won.
p326_174|p326|We are already under pressure.
p326_148|p326|It's a difficult one to comment on.
p326_389|p326|A century on, little has changed.
p326_362|p326|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p326_376|p326|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p326_216|p326|You're going to take away my life.
p326_202|p326|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p326_014|p326|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p326_028|p326|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p326_029|p326|We have got to attack.
p326_001|p326|Please call Stella.
p326_015|p326|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p326_203|p326|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p326_217|p326|He scored a touchdown.
p326_377|p326|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p326_363|p326|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p326_388|p326|That is difficult to answer.
p326_149|p326|Our position is clear.
p326_175|p326|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p326_161|p326|She wanted to move.
p326_106|p326|Our people should be immune.
p326_112|p326|The boys are very confident.
p326_338|p326|It's our worst nightmare.
p326_304|p326|It makes a huge difference.
p326_310|p326|We will meet again.
p326_258|p326|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p326_270|p326|Subs not used, McGraw.
p326_264|p326|She's now on the back benches.
p326_099|p326|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p326_072|p326|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p326_066|p326|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p326_067|p326|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p326_073|p326|The Insider opens tomorrow.
p326_098|p326|It was exactly four months away.
p326_265|p326|But there are some problems.
p326_271|p326|Maybe it helps us.
p326_259|p326|I'd love to have been on the pitch.
p326_311|p326|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p326_305|p326|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p326_339|p326|We gave them the goal.
p326_113|p326|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p326_107|p326|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p326_139|p326|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p326_111|p326|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
p326_105|p326|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p326_313|p326|They should use it on the catwalk.
p326_307|p326|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p326_298|p326|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
p326_267|p326|It should not lose out in any way.
p326_273|p326|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p326_059|p326|This is all part of opening the door.
p326_065|p326|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326_071|p326|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326_070|p326|Messages have to be reinforced.
p326_064|p326|It was a foolhardy decision.
p326_058|p326|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p326_272|p326|Three bystanders were killed.
p326_266|p326|It may also be her last.
p326_299|p326|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p326_306|p326|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p326_312|p326|The other conditions were not specified.
p326_104|p326|We've all been there at some point.
p326_110|p326|It left me with a sadness.
p326_138|p326|Holland won by five wickets.
p326_114|p326|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
p326_100|p326|It was set in a cafe.
p326_128|p326|His father and mother are in film production.
p326_316|p326|It certainly sounded it at times.
p326_302|p326|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p326_289|p326|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p326_262|p326|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p326_276|p326|He made no big mistakes.
p326_060|p326|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p326_074|p326|More patience and composure was required.
p326_048|p326|We will continue to pressure the Government.
p326_049|p326|His art was not just about emotions.
p326_075|p326|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p326_061|p326|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p326_277|p326|It will not be today, though.
p326_263|p326|I ran to get out of the way.
p326_288|p326|They have to work so hard.
p326_303|p326|It is a simple equation.
p326_317|p326|Anyone can take a photo.
p326_129|p326|This is not a long-term commitment.
p326_101|p326|It certainly gives you hope.
p326_115|p326|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p326_103|p326|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
p326_117|p326|Hopefully, everything is for the best.
p326_301|p326|English is the language of pop music.
p326_315|p326|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
p326_329|p326|It had been on the cards.
p326_275|p326|Was it just negligent.
p326_261|p326|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p326_249|p326|Too often it is not.
p326_088|p326|We have them in offices all over.
p326_077|p326|It's just gotten too big.
p326_063|p326|He will become the sovereign.
p326_062|p326|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p326_076|p326|I was shocked and outraged.
p326_089|p326|It need not be like that.
p326_248|p326|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p326_260|p326|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p326_274|p326|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p326_328|p326|We are the weakest link.
p326_314|p326|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
p326_300|p326|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p326_116|p326|What she will do next?
p326_102|p326|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p326_127|p326|I've beaten her a few times.
p326_133|p326|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p326_319|p326|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p326_325|p326|You see, my back has gone.
p326_331|p326|He did, and he missed.
p326_292|p326|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p326_286|p326|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p326_279|p326|That is where our future lies.
p326_251|p326|I tend not to look back.
p326_245|p326|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p326_090|p326|There has been a sense of frustration.
p326_084|p326|They were two different types.
p326_053|p326|Labour was too busy to respond.
p326_047|p326|What on earth is wrong with you?
p326_046|p326|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p326_052|p326|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p326_085|p326|Chelsea was a great club.
p326_091|p326|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p326_244|p326|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p326_250|p326|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p326_278|p326|Which is a shame.
p326_287|p326|We have to focus on what is important.
p326_293|p326|We have to adapt to this level.
p326_330|p326|She looked very, very poor.
p326_324|p326|I've only met him three times.
p326_318|p326|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p326_132|p326|Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
p326_126|p326|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p326_118|p326|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p326_130|p326|It's about attitudes to change.
p326_124|p326|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p326_332|p326|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p326_326|p326|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p326_285|p326|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p326_291|p326|That's my big challenge.
p326_246|p326|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p326_252|p326|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p326_087|p326|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
p326_093|p326|This time, there were no such rewards.
p326_078|p326|We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
p326_044|p326|What did they think of her voice?
p326_050|p326|They are all bright and different.
p326_051|p326|I found a fault and worked at it.
p326_045|p326|They say they feel different.
p326_079|p326|I am immensely proud of them.
p326_092|p326|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p326_086|p326|I can't believe it.
p326_253|p326|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p326_247|p326|Scotland were on Saturday.
p326_290|p326|Well, was it?
p326_284|p326|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p326_327|p326|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p326_333|p326|Many innocent people will die.
p326_125|p326|He looked very sharp.
p326_131|p326|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p326_119|p326|She has now been registered as disabled.
p326_135|p326|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p326_121|p326|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p326_109|p326|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p326_337|p326|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p326_323|p326|I don't want to change anything.
p326_280|p326|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p326_294|p326|So what is it with Nato?
p326_243|p326|It is just completely erased.
p326_257|p326|We would expect it to disappear in time.
p326_082|p326|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p326_096|p326|We are very very proud of Alain.
p326_041|p326|It would be a miracle.
p326_055|p326|They may yet have the last laugh.
p326_069|p326|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p326_068|p326|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p326_054|p326|His voice is strong.
p326_040|p326|The police believe the man was not injured.
p326_097|p326|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p326_083|p326|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p326_256|p326|My game just seems to keep on improving.
p326_242|p326|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p326_295|p326|We won't let you down.
p326_281|p326|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p326_322|p326|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p326_336|p326|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p326_108|p326|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p326_120|p326|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p326_134|p326|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p326_122|p326|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p326_136|p326|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p326_320|p326|He is involved in everything.
p326_334|p326|The mood was defiant.
p326_308|p326|Could you put it in writing?
p326_297|p326|There's a strong involvement.
p326_283|p326|We will be homeless.
p326_254|p326|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
p326_240|p326|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p326_268|p326|We're very pleased about the verdict.
p326_095|p326|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p326_081|p326|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p326_056|p326|But they add up.
p326_042|p326|We just love to chat.
p326_043|p326|I read about it in the newspapers.
p326_057|p326|You can feel at home in China.
p326_080|p326|It was extremely cold.
p326_094|p326|That'd be good for the whole city.
p326_269|p326|It will not be a long campaign.
p326_241|p326|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p326_255|p326|I got a yellow card.
p326_282|p326|That was enough for the committee.
p326_296|p326|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p326_309|p326|They play together perfectly.
p326_335|p326|We have now no choice.
p326_321|p326|Family, if you like.
p326_137|p326|People tended to stay there for some time.
p326_123|p326|That is a data management problem.
p326_187|p326|This is your country.
p326_193|p326|This is still a young team, you know.
p326_178|p326|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p326_144|p326|I've grown up a bit.
p326_150|p326|Yet it does not lose appeal.
p326_385|p326|I have to keep working hard.
p326_391|p326|My father had been unwell for many years.
p326_346|p326|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p326_352|p326|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p326_232|p326|Well, there is a bed.
p326_226|p326|He is a law unto himself.
p326_018|p326|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p326_030|p326|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p326_024|p326|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p326_025|p326|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p326_031|p326|United were in control without always being dominant.
p326_019|p326|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p326_227|p326|I was very, very happy.
p326_233|p326|You write a play.
p326_353|p326|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p326_347|p326|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p326_390|p326|Wrong decisions Address in full
p326_384|p326|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p326_151|p326|But what will we put on it?
p326_145|p326|For a moment it was all about her.
p326_179|p326|He didn't have long to wait.
p326_192|p326|So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
p326_186|p326|He was all blackened.
p326_190|p326|You've just got to move on.
p326_184|p326|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
p326_153|p326|It will benefit a lot of people.
p326_147|p326|Once they go away they won't come back.
p326_392|p326|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p326_386|p326|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p326_379|p326|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p326_351|p326|Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
p326_345|p326|I can't speak for him.
p326_219|p326|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p326_225|p326|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
p326_231|p326|They made it very difficult for us.
p326_027|p326|She is an angel.
p326_033|p326|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p326_032|p326|There we were on the first tee.
p326_026|p326|The message was clear.
p326_230|p326|What is the point of jailing him?
p326_224|p326|People can get them if they want.
p326_218|p326|They finished second and third.
p326_344|p326|The then secretary was not amused.
p326_350|p326|I'm really looking forward to it.
p326_378|p326|But sometimes it works out all right.
p326_387|p326|Art is still a risky investment.
p326_393|p326|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p326_146|p326|It changed my life.
p326_152|p326|Then in came a succession of signings.
p326_185|p326|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p326_191|p326|I feel really good.
p326_195|p326|The British government said she was coming home.
p326_181|p326|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p326_156|p326|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p326_142|p326|I'm the one that said it.
p326_397|p326|My future is in the marathon.
p326_383|p326|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p326_354|p326|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p326_340|p326|Self control is just one instalment.
p326_368|p326|It's hard not to.
p326_220|p326|He was then replaced by Ross.
p326_234|p326|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p326_208|p326|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
p326_022|p326|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p326_036|p326|It was my shortest audition.
p326_037|p326|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p326_023|p326|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p326_209|p326|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p326_235|p326|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p326_221|p326|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p326_369|p326|Broke down and can't be fixed.
p326_341|p326|It would be a massive boost for them.
p326_355|p326|He's on the wrong side.
p326_382|p326|You feel the pride.
p326_396|p326|A great deal has been achieved.
p326_143|p326|It's not hard to get involved.
p326_157|p326|I felt he was excellent.
p326_180|p326|That was merely their initial problem.
p326_194|p326|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
p326_182|p326|It would be really interesting if they did.
p326_196|p326|It's not even finished.
p326_141|p326|We are not going to forget.
p326_155|p326|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p326_169|p326|It was a great team effort.
p326_380|p326|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p326_394|p326|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p326_343|p326|Both are national treasures.
p326_357|p326|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p326_237|p326|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p326_223|p326|She did not attend the courtroom.
p326_035|p326|How would it work?
p326_021|p326|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p326_009|p326|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p326_008|p326|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p326_020|p326|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p326_034|p326|At least two women were among those arrested.
p326_222|p326|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p326_236|p326|Seems a sensible compromise.
p326_356|p326|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p326_342|p326|You never had it so good.
p326_395|p326|It was like the old days.
p326_381|p326|Therein lies the problem.
p326_168|p326|She is a very lucky young lady.
p326_154|p326|A new school will be built.
p326_140|p326|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p326_197|p326|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p326_183|p326|I need them to set my career.
p362_211|p362|I was so relieved.
p362_205|p362|They should not be blamed for it.
p362_417|p362|I had no idea.
p362_198|p362|Do what you want to do.
p362_172|p362|That is for certain.
p362_364|p362|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p362_210|p362|What do you want to say?
p362_012|p362|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p362_010|p362|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p362_212|p362|They continue to do so.
p362_399|p362|That is why he is so special.
p362_158|p362|However, the story has a happy ending.
p362_373|p362|We should not be complacent.
p362_213|p362|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p362_011|p362|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p362_005|p362|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p362_039|p362|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p362_029|p362|It was a fairy tale.
p362_175|p362|That is not, however, the case.
p362_148|p362|It was that kind of match.
p362_362|p362|The same goes for Russia.
p362_410|p362|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p362_216|p362|That is highly unfair.
p362_028|p362|I feel really good.
p362_016|p362|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p362_002|p362|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p362_406|p362|He added that he felt undermined.
p362_374|p362|We all want the same things.
p362_176|p362|Only two players have done it.
p362_188|p362|I thought he was at fault.
p362_163|p362|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p362_003|p362|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p362_017|p362|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p362_070|p362|Allison is not convinced.
p362_266|p362|He's a great dealer.
p362_299|p362|We know the goals will come.
p362_312|p362|It is good football in Scotland.
p362_110|p362|There have been so many.
p362_111|p362|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p362_298|p362|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p362_065|p362|She had no chance.
p362_098|p362|I thought he was my friend.
p362_271|p362|This is not a crisis.
p362_113|p362|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p362_107|p362|The task is enormous.
p362_106|p362|So is that it, then?
p362_112|p362|Of course, it is nonsense.
p362_338|p362|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p362_099|p362|What kind of person is he?
p362_248|p362|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
p362_103|p362|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p362_117|p362|No person was charged.
p362_329|p362|The process itself has taken over.
p362_275|p362|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p362_063|p362|Policing the profession is important.
p362_075|p362|But there is good and bad.
p362_317|p362|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p362_115|p362|Anyone can take a photo.
p362_129|p362|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p362_128|p362|I had never done anything like it before.
p362_114|p362|He had returned to die.
p362_100|p362|There's a strong involvement.
p362_302|p362|But we all have to look at ourselves.
p362_074|p362|She's afraid of life.
p362_119|p362|He's a nice guy.
p362_125|p362|Both are national treasures.
p362_291|p362|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
p362_050|p362|But this was refused.
p362_126|p362|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
p362_286|p362|He will not be coming back.
p362_279|p362|Sad to say, it's still waiting.
p362_053|p362|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p362_255|p362|We are in a very strong position.
p362_282|p362|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p362_321|p362|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p362_137|p362|There is a subtle difference.
p362_122|p362|I got the surprise of my life.
p362_308|p362|We all make mistakes.
p362_297|p362|There will be new memories.
p362_095|p362|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p362_054|p362|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p362_097|p362|Well, was it?
p362_242|p362|Mental health is a massive issue.
p362_322|p362|I don't think it's very real.
p362_120|p362|The fire was still coming down.
p362_134|p362|The building was starting to come down.
p362_108|p362|I know he meant it.
p362_121|p362|It's always the way.
p362_337|p362|It was quite an ordeal for them.
p362_323|p362|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p362_069|p362|It's more relaxing this way.
p362_041|p362|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p362_055|p362|He is one of them.
p362_224|p362|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p362_344|p362|He was their leader.
p362_153|p362|A century on, little has changed.
p362_147|p362|I don't think we deserved to lose.
p362_392|p362|This makes up for it.
p362_345|p362|The support of Britain is assumed.
p362_225|p362|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p362_027|p362|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p362_019|p362|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p362_347|p362|Maybe they will show it next year.
p362_390|p362|No progress has been made.
p362_178|p362|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p362_232|p362|That had never happened.
p362_030|p362|But there are no plans.
p362_222|p362|Are you up for business?
p362_356|p362|They will do something big.
p362_418|p362|As indeed it did.
p362_154|p362|Wrong decisions Address in full
p362_168|p362|People also have trouble with the currency.
p362_197|p362|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
p362_380|p362|We are not getting him back.
p362_009|p362|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p362_037|p362|It's not Big Brother at sea.
p362_369|p362|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p362_194|p362|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p362_195|p362|I never had any real direction at school.
p362_397|p362|Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
p362_383|p362|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p362_340|p362|O no it's not!
p362_022|p362|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p300_173|p300|It has been recorded twice.
p300_365|p300|Both are national treasures.
p300_371|p300|This takes the pressure off.
p300_359|p300|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p300_211|p300|He ended up a headmaster.
p300_205|p300|We played them off the pitch.
p300_239|p300|It's just gotten too big.
p300_013|p300|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p300_007|p300|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p300_006|p300|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p300_012|p300|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p300_238|p300|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p300_204|p300|Donald was a man with many friends.
p300_210|p300|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p300_358|p300|You see, my back has gone.
p300_370|p300|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p300_364|p300|It's an hour of the same response.
p300_172|p300|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p300_166|p300|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p300_199|p300|I like footballers who play well.
p300_170|p300|What has caused the demise of singing?
p300_164|p300|I do my job.
p300_158|p300|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p300_399|p300|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p300_372|p300|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p300_366|p300|And here is the rub.
p300_400|p300|Six other people were injured.
p300_206|p300|It is turning that way all across Europe.
p300_212|p300|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p300_004|p300|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p300_010|p300|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p300_038|p300|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p300_039|p300|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p300_011|p300|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p300_005|p300|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p300_213|p300|It is like being a qualifier again.
p300_207|p300|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p300_367|p300|They are also exploited by the markets.
p300_373|p300|I will never get over his death.
p300_398|p300|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p300_159|p300|They thought they had found a home.
p300_165|p300|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p300_171|p300|We want to help them through it.
p300_149|p300|I feel my life to be at risk.
p300_175|p300|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p300_161|p300|You should be there with six different characters.
p300_388|p300|A century on, little has changed.
p300_377|p300|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p300_363|p300|This is not great, but it goes well.
p300_203|p300|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p300_217|p300|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p300_029|p300|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p300_001|p300|Please call Stella.
p300_015|p300|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
p300_014|p300|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p300_028|p300|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p300_216|p300|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p300_202|p300|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p300_362|p300|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p300_376|p300|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p300_389|p300|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p300_160|p300|She collapsed and died a day later.
p300_174|p300|It was a bit like having children.
p300_148|p300|I was in the train station overnight.
p300_189|p300|It was located on the remote control.
p300_162|p300|Laura is an investment banker.
p300_176|p300|It is very difficult to find a buyer.
p300_348|p300|It is a simple equation.
p300_360|p300|She looked very, very poor.
p300_374|p300|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p300_228|p300|They may yet have the last laugh.
p300_214|p300|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p300_200|p300|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p300_016|p300|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p300_002|p300|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p300_003|p300|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p300_017|p300|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p300_201|p300|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p300_215|p300|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p300_229|p300|You can feel at home in China.
p300_375|p300|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p300_361|p300|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p300_349|p300|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p300_177|p300|It shows that we are civilised society.
p300_163|p300|I took a minibus into town.
p300_188|p300|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p300_104|p300|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p300_110|p300|I am prepared to step down.
p300_138|p300|We were with him the whole time.
p300_306|p300|Their message was simple.
p300_312|p300|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p300_299|p300|They finished second and third.
p300_272|p300|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p300_266|p300|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p300_070|p300|This is the way things should be handled.
p300_064|p300|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p300_058|p300|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
p300_059|p300|He was taken ill in December last year.
p300_065|p300|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p300_071|p300|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p300_267|p300|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p300_273|p300|The board has rejected her proposals.
p300_298|p300|My view has now completely changed.
p300_313|p300|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p300_307|p300|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p300_139|p300|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p300_111|p300|I'm not a diva.
p300_105|p300|People just came on their own.
p300_113|p300|Look at them after three days of rain.
p300_107|p300|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p300_311|p300|An aide was constructed to get a copy.
p300_305|p300|People can get them if they want.
p300_339|p300|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p300_265|p300|Holland won by five wickets.
p300_271|p300|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p300_259|p300|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p300_098|p300|There are a huge number of arts.
p300_067|p300|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p300_073|p300|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p300_072|p300|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p300_066|p300|He also does not get along with Christina.
p300_099|p300|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p300_258|p300|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p300_270|p300|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p300_264|p300|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p300_338|p300|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p300_304|p300|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p300_310|p300|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p300_106|p300|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p300_112|p300|There is great relief at this point.
p300_116|p300|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p300_102|p300|Where is the anthrax?
p300_328|p300|Maybe it helps us.
p300_314|p300|It is just completely erased.
p300_300|p300|We agreed to disagree.
p300_248|p300|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p300_260|p300|He must have something up his sleeve.
p300_274|p300|It does not move, which is amazing.
p300_089|p300|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p300_062|p300|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p300_076|p300|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p300_077|p300|You'd think there was a match on today.
p300_063|p300|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p300_088|p300|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p300_275|p300|She is a very lucky young lady.
p300_261|p300|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p300_249|p300|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p300_301|p300|He was then replaced by Ross.
p300_315|p300|A great deal has been achieved.
p300_329|p300|Three bystanders were killed.
p300_103|p300|Housing is in very short supply.
p300_117|p300|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p300_129|p300|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p300_101|p300|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p300_115|p300|There is no point in pushing it.
p300_303|p300|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p300_317|p300|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p300_288|p300|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p300_277|p300|Tourism continues to struggle.
p300_263|p300|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p300_049|p300|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p300_075|p300|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p300_061|p300|It's all too short term.
p300_060|p300|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p300_074|p300|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p300_048|p300|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p300_262|p300|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p300_276|p300|The threat to rural areas is real.
p300_289|p300|The fund has three elements.
p300_316|p300|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p300_302|p300|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p300_114|p300|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p300_100|p300|My office is bare.
p300_128|p300|She says the royal family get on well.
p300_125|p300|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p300_131|p300|That group reported just before Christmas.
p300_119|p300|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p300_327|p300|It may also be her last.
p300_333|p300|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p300_290|p300|This is still a young team, you know.
p300_284|p300|We said, What do you mean?
p300_253|p300|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p300_247|p300|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p300_092|p300|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p300_086|p300|I have made good progress.
p300_051|p300|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p300_045|p300|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p300_079|p300|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p300_078|p300|We must move on.
p300_044|p300|We like being the underdogs.
p300_050|p300|Except for this, it was offside.
p300_087|p300|We do need a new one.
p300_093|p300|But the relief was short-lived.
p300_246|p300|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p300_252|p300|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p300_285|p300|I need them to set my career.
p300_291|p300|It's not even finished.
p300_332|p300|He made no big mistakes.
p300_326|p300|She is now on the back benches.
p300_118|p300|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p300_130|p300|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p300_124|p300|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p300_132|p300|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p300_126|p300|There is a lack of chemistry.
p300_330|p300|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p300_324|p300|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p300_318|p300|Too often it is not.
p300_287|p300|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p300_293|p300|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p300_244|p300|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p300_250|p300|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p300_278|p300|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p300_085|p300|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p300_091|p300|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p300_046|p300|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p300_052|p300|It's a grey area.
p300_053|p300|Retirement, who knows?
p300_047|p300|But the law is very clear on this.
p300_090|p300|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p300_084|p300|Why did they let him go?
p300_279|p300|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p300_251|p300|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p300_245|p300|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p300_292|p300|Everyone knew where they were.
p300_286|p300|The law will take its course.
p300_319|p300|I tend not to look back.
p300_325|p300|It's good to start with Judith.
p300_331|p300|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p300_127|p300|I went straight to the toilet.
p300_133|p300|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p300_137|p300|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p300_123|p300|This is not understood by people outside.
p300_309|p300|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p300_335|p300|I believe he can do a better job.
p300_321|p300|I got a yellow card.
p300_282|p300|That was merely their initial problem.
p300_296|p300|After that he became more romantic.
p300_269|p300|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p300_241|p300|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p300_255|p300|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p300_080|p300|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p300_094|p300|You had better believe it.
p300_043|p300|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p300_057|p300|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p300_056|p300|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p300_042|p300|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p300_095|p300|The mood is upbeat.
p300_081|p300|His options are severely limited.
p300_254|p300|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p300_240|p300|Was all this really just five months ago?
p300_268|p300|Once they go away they won't come back.
p300_297|p300|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p300_283|p300|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p300_320|p300|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p300_334|p300|We will be homeless.
p300_308|p300|He is a law unto himself.
p300_122|p300|I will speak to Michael about this.
p300_136|p300|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p300_108|p300|You either have him or you don't.
p300_120|p300|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p300_134|p300|There is still much work to be done.
p300_322|p300|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p300_336|p300|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p300_295|p300|People will make up their own minds.
p300_281|p300|This is a great shame.
p300_256|p300|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p300_242|p300|They were two different types.
p300_097|p300|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p300_083|p300|They are not an item.
p300_068|p300|How things have changed since then.
p300_054|p300|He was shocked by what he saw.
p300_040|p300|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p300_041|p300|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p300_055|p300|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p300_069|p300|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p300_082|p300|This is truly field of miracles.
p300_096|p300|He told us about it the next day.
p300_243|p300|It need not be like that.
p300_257|p300|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p300_280|p300|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p300_294|p300|In the old days, it was easy.
p300_337|p300|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p300_323|p300|I don't know what he was capable of.
p300_135|p300|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p300_121|p300|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p300_109|p300|There are some new buildings in there.
p300_185|p300|I am writing a novel.
p300_191|p300|Twaddle is a case in point.
p300_146|p300|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p300_152|p300|We came across the first set of bodies.
p300_387|p300|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p300_393|p300|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
p300_344|p300|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p300_350|p300|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p300_378|p300|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p300_230|p300|This is all part of opening the door.
p300_224|p300|There is nothing like this back home.
p300_218|p300|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p300_032|p300|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p300_026|p300|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p300_027|p300|It is not an amnesty.
p300_033|p300|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p300_219|p300|I might get an injury very easily.
p300_225|p300|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p300_231|p300|We have tried to keep his head up.
p300_379|p300|They should have some measure of protection.
p300_351|p300|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p300_345|p300|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p300_392|p300|I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
p300_386|p300|Construction would then begin.
p300_153|p300|We need some confidence to get a win.
p300_147|p300|We need a new kind of theatre.
p300_190|p300|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p300_184|p300|We believe a third party was involved.
p300_192|p300|These elements are not in the book.
p300_186|p300|A bit of match fitness is required.
p300_151|p300|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p300_145|p300|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p300_179|p300|I came home by ambulance.
p300_390|p300|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p300_384|p300|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p300_347|p300|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p300_227|p300|It was a poor performance.
p300_233|p300|He will become the sovereign.
p300_025|p300|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p300_031|p300|I don't believe you own anything.
p300_019|p300|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p300_018|p300|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p300_030|p300|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p300_024|p300|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p300_232|p300|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p300_226|p300|I found a fault and it worked at it.
p300_346|p300|English is the language of pop music.
p300_352|p300|Who has the second highest?
p300_385|p300|That's the kind of thing that counts.
p300_391|p300|Form and structure are his music.
p300_178|p300|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p300_144|p300|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p300_150|p300|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p300_187|p300|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p300_193|p300|You look at them and you understand.
p300_197|p300|We have only nine months to go.
p300_183|p300|This one was my best chance.
p300_168|p300|Four policemen were wounded.
p300_154|p300|Does that put pressure on us?
p300_140|p300|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p300_395|p300|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
p300_381|p300|Who is going to pay their wages?
p300_356|p300|No person was charged.
p300_342|p300|What kind of person is he?
p300_222|p300|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p300_236|p300|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p300_008|p300|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p300_020|p300|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p300_034|p300|Blood samples have been taken.
p300_035|p300|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p300_021|p300|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p300_009|p300|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p300_237|p300|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p300_223|p300|She didn't tell us anything new.
p300_343|p300|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p300_357|p300|I've only met him three times.
p300_380|p300|They did not threaten anyone.
p300_394|p300|The award was a lifeline for me.
p300_141|p300|That's because we work hard at it.
p300_169|p300|Who do these people think they are?
p300_182|p300|She is living proof of their expertise.
p300_196|p300|The FBI could become involved.
p300_180|p300|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p300_194|p300|I am considered a teenager.
p300_143|p300|He's been the key to everything.
p300_157|p300|You might even have seen him.
p300_382|p300|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p300_396|p300|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
p300_369|p300|I am really looking forward to it.
p300_341|p300|We won't let you down.
p300_355|p300|I didn't even have the first idea.
p300_209|p300|That night was a terrible muddle.
p300_235|p300|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p300_221|p300|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p300_037|p300|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p300_023|p300|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p300_022|p300|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p300_036|p300|He said he now intends to fly today.
p300_220|p300|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p300_234|p300|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p300_208|p300|We were on top and could've won.
p300_354|p300|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p300_340|p300|Well, was it?
p300_368|p300|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p300_397|p300|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p300_383|p300|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p300_156|p300|This is a foolish idea.
p300_142|p300|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p300_195|p300|I would like Glasgow.
p300_181|p300|This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p307_319|p307|EMI is a prime example.
p307_127|p307|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p307_133|p307|Both were later released after a check-up.
p307_053|p307|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307_047|p307|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p307_090|p307|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p307_084|p307|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p307_251|p307|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p307_245|p307|Which perhaps is just as well.
p307_279|p307|There is no substitute.
p307_292|p307|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p307_286|p307|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p307_287|p307|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p307_293|p307|We just want to get stuck in now.
p307_278|p307|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p307_244|p307|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p307_250|p307|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p307_085|p307|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p307_091|p307|People love to see this stuff.
p307_046|p307|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p307_052|p307|She is now planning a visit.
p307_132|p307|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p307_126|p307|Tony Blair should get out more.
p307_318|p307|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p307_330|p307|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p307_324|p307|A friendship that will endure.
p307_332|p307|I am not obsessed with sex.
p307_326|p307|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p307_130|p307|We need to move forward together.
p307_124|p307|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p307_118|p307|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p307_044|p307|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307_050|p307|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p307_078|p307|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p307_087|p307|It has never been worthwhile.
p307_093|p307|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p307_246|p307|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p307_252|p307|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p307_285|p307|It was an empowering journey.
p307_291|p307|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p307_290|p307|Everything has been destroyed.
p307_284|p307|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p307_253|p307|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p307_247|p307|He would just say it was terrible.
p307_092|p307|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p307_086|p307|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p307_079|p307|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307_051|p307|It was, however, the wrong side.
p307_045|p307|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p307_119|p307|It is not great art.
p307_125|p307|We aim to put them out of business.
p307_131|p307|She died in hospital two hours later.
p307_327|p307|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p307_333|p307|They've been at it for five hours.
p307_337|p307|His English counterpart agreed.
p307_323|p307|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p307_109|p307|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p307_135|p307|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p307_121|p307|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p307_069|p307|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p307_041|p307|It doesn't make them evil.
p307_055|p307|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p307_082|p307|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p307_096|p307|We did not even get a free kick.
p307_243|p307|His son is a local legend.
p307_257|p307|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p307_280|p307|That nation is South Africa.
p307_294|p307|Do you come from Moscow?
p307_295|p307|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p307_281|p307|This will secure the future of our industry.
p307_256|p307|Wanger was never like this.
p307_242|p307|There are nine people here now.
p307_097|p307|He was married with a young child.
p307_083|p307|Cars are great for going long distances.
p307_054|p307|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p307_040|p307|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p307_068|p307|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p307_120|p307|You do not change overnight.
p307_134|p307|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p307_108|p307|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p307_322|p307|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p307_336|p307|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p307_308|p307|They will have to make changes.
p307_320|p307|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p307_334|p307|There is no answer to it.
p307_122|p307|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p307_136|p307|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p307_056|p307|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p307_042|p307|I have played really well all year.
p307_095|p307|I have no plans to change the oath.
p307_081|p307|He came in an army uniform.
p307_268|p307|Racism has no place in any sport.
p307_254|p307|The final stage is paranoia.
p307_240|p307|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p307_297|p307|They are the innocent victims.
p307_283|p307|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p307_282|p307|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p307_296|p307|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p307_241|p307|That is nearly four people every day.
p307_255|p307|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p307_269|p307|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p307_080|p307|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p307_094|p307|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p307_043|p307|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p307_057|p307|I keep my fingers crossed.
p307_137|p307|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p307_123|p307|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p307_335|p307|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p307_321|p307|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p307_309|p307|This fact is supported by audience research.
p307_346|p307|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p307_420|p307|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p307_352|p307|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p307_408|p307|I saw some good things.
p307_391|p307|I had no qualms about it.
p307_144|p307|This was not just incongruous.
p307_150|p307|But it looks good for next year.
p307_178|p307|The big issue for us is the review.
p307_187|p307|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p307_193|p307|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p307_030|p307|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p307_024|p307|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p307_018|p307|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p307_232|p307|That's the key issue isn't it?
p307_226|p307|If not, a deal could take many months.
p307_227|p307|The team this year is going places.
p307_233|p307|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p307_019|p307|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p307_025|p307|But it was a great decision he joked.
p307_031|p307|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p307_192|p307|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
p307_186|p307|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p307_179|p307|There was a fossil on screen.
p307_151|p307|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p307_145|p307|It is patently true.
p307_390|p307|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p307_384|p307|It looks like paradise.
p307_353|p307|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p307_347|p307|I just want to change my life.
p307_421|p307|His views are hardly surprising.
p307_351|p307|He knew it would cost him millions.
p307_423|p307|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p307_345|p307|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p307_379|p307|It's being very carefully looked at.
p307_392|p307|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p307_386|p307|We were short of athletes.
p307_153|p307|He was forced to quit.
p307_147|p307|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p307_190|p307|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p307_184|p307|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p307_027|p307|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p307_033|p307|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p307_225|p307|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p307_231|p307|He said because people had invited him.
p307_219|p307|What are you not good at?
p307_218|p307|These findings would be made public.
p307_230|p307|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p307_224|p307|It had a gigantic effect.
p307_032|p307|The punishment was swift.
p307_026|p307|They changed the world of music.
p307_185|p307|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p307_191|p307|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p307_146|p307|You hope he prevails.
p307_152|p307|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p307_387|p307|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p307_393|p307|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p307_378|p307|There is no openness.
p307_422|p307|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p307_344|p307|We were lucky to have survived.
p307_350|p307|And Michael was just great.
p307_368|p307|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p307_354|p307|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p307_340|p307|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p307_397|p307|Partition is not an option.
p307_383|p307|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p307_156|p307|But you can't have it both ways.
p307_142|p307|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p307_195|p307|Harold is a rarity.
p307_181|p307|This does not create any precedent.
p307_022|p307|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p307_036|p307|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p307_208|p307|We have no choice but to shut down.
p307_220|p307|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p307_234|p307|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p307_235|p307|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p307_221|p307|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p307_209|p307|The prognosis is excellent.
p307_037|p307|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p307_023|p307|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p307_180|p307|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p307_194|p307|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p307_143|p307|All things are possible if you believe.
p307_157|p307|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p307_382|p307|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
p307_396|p307|It was early morning.
p307_341|p307|I am not putting myself down.
p307_355|p307|That only came out during a radio interview.
p307_369|p307|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p307_419|p307|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p307_343|p307|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p307_357|p307|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p307_380|p307|It was a job he loved.
p307_394|p307|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p307_169|p307|They were behind the wheel.
p307_141|p307|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p307_155|p307|I was loving that little girl.
p307_182|p307|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p307_196|p307|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p307_009|p307|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p307_035|p307|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p307_021|p307|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p307_237|p307|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p307_223|p307|I go home only once.
p307_222|p307|This makes no sense!
p307_236|p307|I came up through the ranks.
p307_020|p307|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p307_034|p307|I kept my side of the bargain.
p307_008|p307|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p307_197|p307|I want him to take on Gomez.
p307_183|p307|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p307_154|p307|It is good for their eyesight.
p307_140|p307|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p307_168|p307|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p307_395|p307|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p307_381|p307|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p307_356|p307|We are now setting about finding them.
p307_424|p307|Nobody else was with me.
p307_342|p307|He's a joy to follow.
p307_418|p307|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p307_367|p307|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p307_401|p307|I won't go back to Holland.
p307_373|p307|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p307_398|p307|What other retailer would do this?
p307_165|p307|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
p307_171|p307|The problem arises because he does so much.
p307_159|p307|The death toll included five children.
p307_011|p307|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p307_005|p307|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p307_039|p307|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p307_213|p307|I would not want to be young again.
p307_207|p307|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p307_206|p307|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p307_212|p307|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p307_038|p307|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p307_010|p307|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p307_158|p307|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p307_170|p307|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p307_164|p307|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p307_399|p307|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p307_414|p307|Now you see him, now you don't.
p307_372|p307|His job was not advertised.
p307_366|p307|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p307_400|p307|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p307_370|p307|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p307_416|p307|So now this series has had its day.
p307_402|p307|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p307_364|p307|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p307_358|p307|We must not go down that road.
p307_172|p307|The answer is mayhem.
p307_166|p307|However, who could have predicted this result?
p307_199|p307|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p307_006|p307|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p307_012|p307|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p307_204|p307|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p307_210|p307|They always want to give a performance.
p307_238|p307|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p307_239|p307|These guys will not lie down.
p307_211|p307|But he just carried on anyway.
p307_205|p307|He will emerge as a world leader.
p307_013|p307|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p307_007|p307|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p307_198|p307|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p307_167|p307|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p307_173|p307|Our young people are leaving.
p307_359|p307|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p307_403|p307|There was no cohesion.
p307_365|p307|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p307_371|p307|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p307_417|p307|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p307_349|p307|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p307_413|p307|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p307_375|p307|He has changed my life for ever.
p307_361|p307|And that match was played in June.
p307_407|p307|My thoughts are with their families.
p307_177|p307|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p307_163|p307|This is a United Kingdom.
p307_188|p307|I hope you miss the cut.
p307_003|p307|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p307_017|p307|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p307_229|p307|It took more than two years.
p307_201|p307|Well, what do you know?
p307_215|p307|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p307_214|p307|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p307_200|p307|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p307_228|p307|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p307_016|p307|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p307_002|p307|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p307_189|p307|The role was perfect for Russell.
p307_162|p307|I understand the medical concerns.
p307_176|p307|That will be the sweetness.
p307_360|p307|I am not among its admirers.
p307_406|p307|Jackson may well be right.
p307_412|p307|But who gets on the tube?
p307_374|p307|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p307_348|p307|He did not oppose the divorce.
p307_404|p307|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p307_362|p307|He will address the nation this evening.
p307_376|p307|The home was now under new management.
p307_410|p307|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p307_389|p307|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p307_148|p307|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p307_160|p307|Before the game we went for a pint.
p307_174|p307|What, then, is the real thing?
p307_028|p307|The law has got to be upheld.
p307_014|p307|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p307_216|p307|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p307_202|p307|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p307_203|p307|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p307_217|p307|They were later discharged from hospital.
p307_001|p307|Please call Stella.
p307_015|p307|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p307_029|p307|But we're not the same person.
p307_175|p307|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p307_161|p307|There is no credible official announcement.
p307_149|p307|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p307_388|p307|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p307_377|p307|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p307_411|p307|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p307_405|p307|Whether this return was too soon.
p307_363|p307|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p307_304|p307|They tried to give her advice.
p307_310|p307|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p307_338|p307|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p307_106|p307|I think my game is suited to grass.
p307_112|p307|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p307_072|p307|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p307_066|p307|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p307_099|p307|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p307_270|p307|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p307_264|p307|It's the same old story.
p307_258|p307|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p307_259|p307|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p307_265|p307|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p307_271|p307|Bombing is the easy option.
p307_098|p307|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p307_067|p307|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p307_073|p307|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p307_113|p307|The conversion didn't go over either.
p307_107|p307|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p307_339|p307|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p307_311|p307|Both sides have to step back.
p307_305|p307|That it is a brand name.
p307_313|p307|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p307_307|p307|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p307_111|p307|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p307_105|p307|Is your life a little too easy?
p307_139|p307|I'm very puzzled by it.
p307_065|p307|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p307_071|p307|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p307_059|p307|It's the best of both worlds.
p307_267|p307|I do not own the vessel in question.
p307_273|p307|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p307_298|p307|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p307_299|p307|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p307_272|p307|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p307_266|p307|It was a moment of madness.
p307_058|p307|The encounter was to change his life.
p307_070|p307|When he took over it really took off.
p307_064|p307|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p307_138|p307|The son has autism and other problems.
p307_104|p307|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p307_110|p307|People want to see me on the screen.
p307_306|p307|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p307_312|p307|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p307_316|p307|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p307_302|p307|Broke the birdie record.
p307_128|p307|He was just awesome.
p307_114|p307|He took away my childhood.
p307_100|p307|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p307_048|p307|I try not to expect anything.
p307_060|p307|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p307_074|p307|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p307_262|p307|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p307_276|p307|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p307_289|p307|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p307_288|p307|They had been together for about three years.
p307_277|p307|Little Voice is on general release.
p307_263|p307|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p307_075|p307|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p307_061|p307|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p307_049|p307|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p307_101|p307|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p307_115|p307|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p307_129|p307|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p307_303|p307|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p307_317|p307|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p307_329|p307|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p307_301|p307|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p307_315|p307|We are ready for the long haul.
p307_103|p307|I am very sorry to be here.
p307_117|p307|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p307_077|p307|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p307_063|p307|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p307_088|p307|So other options had to be explored.
p307_249|p307|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p307_275|p307|I'd say we should give it a week.
p307_261|p307|We're not travel agents.
p307_260|p307|That's the sort of game you want.
p307_274|p307|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p307_248|p307|This is the New Edinburgh.
p307_089|p307|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p307_062|p307|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p307_076|p307|This is a mental challenge.
p307_116|p307|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p307_102|p307|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p307_314|p307|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p307_300|p307|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p307_328|p307|He is young but not too young.
p336_165|p336|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
p336_398|p336|He put a lot of effort into it.
p336_415|p336|The auction has seven days to run.
p336_373|p336|Further expansion is possible.
p336_401|p336|Are you all right?
p336_207|p336|The train was on time.
p336_213|p336|Politics is a tough game.
p336_039|p336|That gives us something to kick against.
p336_005|p336|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p336_011|p336|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p336_010|p336|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p336_004|p336|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p336_038|p336|IT is a terrible equation.
p336_206|p336|Do they play for the money?
p336_366|p336|Who wouldn't do it?
p336_400|p336|I am not that sadistic.
p336_372|p336|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p336_399|p336|The pressure is enormous.
p336_164|p336|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p336_170|p336|These days will be back.
p336_158|p336|This is the culture change in medicine.
p336_199|p336|And it's more subversive.
p336_166|p336|Nobody could survive on that.
p336_172|p336|It could last five months.
p336_358|p336|Inside, there is a kind of madness.
p336_402|p336|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p336_364|p336|He was not alone.
p336_370|p336|We are all in the frontline.
p336_416|p336|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p336_238|p336|But we must work in harmony.
p336_210|p336|More than that, it's a vicious circle.
p336_204|p336|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p336_012|p336|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p336_006|p336|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p336_007|p336|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p336_013|p336|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p336_205|p336|It's part of the end game.
p336_211|p336|And how much of a compliment is that?
p336_239|p336|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p336_371|p336|It looked like a war zone.
p336_417|p336|They want to prove a point.
p336_403|p336|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
p336_365|p336|There was too much at stake.
p336_359|p336|I'd like to run.
p336_173|p336|Everything is accounted for.
p336_167|p336|I can't do anything before nine.
p336_198|p336|But who will buy it?
p336_188|p336|New Labour are running scared.
p336_163|p336|Everything has its place and purpose.
p336_177|p336|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
p336_361|p336|But this relative success has not been easy.
p336_407|p336|It would be that absurd.
p336_413|p336|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p336_375|p336|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
p336_349|p336|People want to learn.
p336_215|p336|What has changed?
p336_201|p336|It wouldn't go off.
p336_229|p336|She told me to stop.
p336_017|p336|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p336_003|p336|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p336_002|p336|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p336_016|p336|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p336_228|p336|How will we get there?
p336_200|p336|Openness is always the best way.
p336_214|p336|I have friends in Glasgow.
p336_348|p336|He is very much respected within the group.
p336_412|p336|He wants the festival to make a difference.
p336_374|p336|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p336_360|p336|Its future is no longer in question.
p336_406|p336|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p336_176|p336|However, it does not tell the full story.
p336_162|p336|I hope he gets it.
p336_189|p336|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p336_174|p336|The support from the general public was astounding.
p336_160|p336|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p336_148|p336|Then there is the Mini itself.
p336_389|p336|I am not going to sit back.
p336_376|p336|At this point we can only speculate.
p336_410|p336|She made no further comment.
p336_404|p336|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
p336_362|p336|I am a player.
p336_202|p336|I've been enjoying it, though.
p336_216|p336|There's nothing to be gained by it.
p336_014|p336|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p336_028|p336|This is a very interesting move.
p336_029|p336|Are we not men?
p336_015|p336|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p336_001|p336|Please call Stella.
p336_217|p336|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p336_203|p336|The professor said the results were positive.
p336_405|p336|Is it any good?
p336_363|p336|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p336_377|p336|We know we have the quality.
p336_411|p336|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
p336_388|p336|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p336_149|p336|This may be perfectly innocent.
p336_161|p336|I have no battle with the Scots.
p336_175|p336|About time too, you might think.
p336_112|p336|That is how we will be judged.
p336_106|p336|Don't you believe it.
p336_338|p336|I was in tears in the street.
p336_310|p336|That was me today.
p336_304|p336|They are not always the same person.
p336_258|p336|When will you listen?
p336_264|p336|Ferguson must take the blame.
p336_270|p336|Some injustice was committed.
p336_099|p336|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p336_066|p336|Get used to it.
p336_072|p336|Still, some additions are inspired.
p336_073|p336|Any error is severely punished.
p336_067|p336|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p336_098|p336|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p336_271|p336|I've had a wonderful career.
p336_265|p336|There is no point in denying that.
p336_259|p336|I'm happy that we have agreed.
p336_305|p336|We meet again in Berlin.
p336_311|p336|That is when we are really effective.
p336_339|p336|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p336_107|p336|There is another important factor.
p336_113|p336|It's there for people to look at.
p336_139|p336|He is that good.
p336_105|p336|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p336_111|p336|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p336_307|p336|It is a daunting task.
p336_313|p336|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p336_273|p336|I didn't expect to be in.
p336_267|p336|Not that it is unique.
p336_059|p336|They enjoy playing the game.
p336_071|p336|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p336_065|p336|I let go the telephone and ran.
p336_064|p336|The second is freedom.
p336_070|p336|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p336_058|p336|This ruling is a farce.
p336_266|p336|The kids are paying the price.
p336_272|p336|The BBC was a disgrace.
p336_299|p336|Relief was beyond belief.
p336_312|p336|They just would not have run away.
p336_306|p336|This is a very special moment for me.
p336_110|p336|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p336_104|p336|It was one of the firemen.
p336_138|p336|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p336_100|p336|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p336_114|p336|We are getting there.
p336_128|p336|The criteria have changed.
p336_302|p336|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p336_316|p336|This is an appealing record.
p336_289|p336|It has become very confused.
p336_276|p336|I should think so, too.
p336_262|p336|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p336_074|p336|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p336_060|p336|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p336_048|p336|The crowd was waiting.
p336_049|p336|It was a joy.
p336_061|p336|It is not standing army.
p336_075|p336|But we will learn from that.
p336_263|p336|You can spend money on housing.
p336_277|p336|If so, we want to hear from them.
p336_288|p336|Yet he remains confident enough.
p336_317|p336|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p336_303|p336|It is three years.
p336_129|p336|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p336_115|p336|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p336_101|p336|That is unlikely to happen.
p336_117|p336|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
p336_103|p336|This is not finished.
p336_315|p336|But he made a mistake in picking it.
p336_301|p336|It was complete nonsense.
p336_329|p336|We'll see what happens.
p336_261|p336|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p336_275|p336|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
p336_249|p336|I don't have any regrets about the edit.
p336_088|p336|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p336_063|p336|Someone else has now got them.
p336_077|p336|We couldn't afford it.
p336_076|p336|He has not created a Festival resource.
p336_062|p336|It was a crucial moment.
p336_089|p336|But who was driving it?
p336_248|p336|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p336_274|p336|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p336_260|p336|All of them were killed.
p336_328|p336|And it's difficult to argue.
p336_300|p336|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p336_314|p336|This idea has been around for four years.
p336_102|p336|That is a mark of what you are.
p336_116|p336|They never got into the show this time.
p336_133|p336|It has been declared.
p336_127|p336|It's better than that, it's fantastic.
p336_319|p336|This is a problem we have to tackle.
p336_331|p336|That's not part of the deal.
p336_325|p336|We don't have money to get to town.
p336_286|p336|He had no problem with alcohol.
p336_292|p336|I just made it.
p336_279|p336|He denied the charge.
p336_245|p336|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p336_251|p336|The family baton is handed on.
p336_084|p336|It will be easier for us.
p336_090|p336|We have to get this sorted out.
p336_047|p336|There can be no dispute about our history.
p336_053|p336|It is nearly there.
p336_052|p336|He died from multiple injuries.
p336_046|p336|My office is down there.
p336_091|p336|It was very fast.
p336_085|p336|I don't think it is.
p336_250|p336|That does not mean we have failed.
p336_244|p336|I believe in theatre.
p336_278|p336|It's not covered by the insurance.
p336_293|p336|There was no secrecy.
p336_287|p336|I had no experience at all.
p336_324|p336|I don't want to do too much.
p336_330|p336|That could be in place by next year.
p336_318|p336|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p336_126|p336|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p336_132|p336|I just have no maternal instincts.
p336_118|p336|But no, it's not funny.
p336_124|p336|The whole thing was just unreal.
p336_130|p336|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p336_326|p336|We have great support.
p336_332|p336|There is a problem.
p336_291|p336|It's a national sport.
p336_285|p336|The cause remained a mystery last night.
p336_252|p336|She has a little boy.
p336_246|p336|It's time to say enough is enough.
p336_093|p336|When is it ever anything else?
p336_087|p336|On that they agree.
p336_078|p336|I get the bus.
p336_050|p336|It's the same with cinema.
p336_044|p336|This isn't a new problem.
p336_045|p336|That, though, was just the start of it.
p336_051|p336|It was the climax of the thing.
p336_079|p336|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p336_086|p336|There are no other contenders.
p336_092|p336|Singing is my first love.
p336_247|p336|He has to pull back from the brink.
p336_253|p336|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p336_284|p336|I am not a liar.
p336_290|p336|Fame and money followed.
p336_333|p336|He pretended not to care.
p336_327|p336|One would not want to go there anyway.
p336_131|p336|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p336_125|p336|They haven't been thought through.
p336_119|p336|We just try to make great records.
p336_121|p336|Why does it come out now?
p336_135|p336|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p336_109|p336|I want to keep playing.
p336_323|p336|One paper was not returned.
p336_337|p336|Wouldn't it be nice?
p336_294|p336|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p336_280|p336|I was shaking on the blocks.
p336_257|p336|This is a personal decision for me.
p336_243|p336|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p336_096|p336|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
p336_082|p336|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p336_055|p336|We said, What do you mean?
p336_041|p336|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
p336_069|p336|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p336_068|p336|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p336_040|p336|It was pretty special.
p336_054|p336|I'm going to buy a car.
p336_083|p336|Would you have ever believed that was possible?
p336_097|p336|This is in a league of its own.
p336_242|p336|The English are coming.
p336_256|p336|All my training is for Athens.
p336_281|p336|There is no easy answer.
p336_295|p336|Even then it might be difficult.
p336_336|p336|Was it too obvious?
p336_322|p336|No person has been charged.
p336_108|p336|Most people know that.
p336_134|p336|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p336_120|p336|It's almost certainly not going to help.
p336_136|p336|It's very hard to plan for it.
p336_122|p336|In that case, the children were not missing.
p336_334|p336|They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
p336_320|p336|Yes, it was uplifting.
p336_308|p336|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p336_283|p336|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p336_297|p336|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p336_240|p336|There is no other way.
p336_254|p336|He has refused to do that.
p336_268|p336|We're all going to take a holiday.
p336_081|p336|The issues are not going to change.
p336_095|p336|I believe in trade unions.
p336_042|p336|I should say so.
p336_056|p336|I have been there many times.
p336_057|p336|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p336_043|p336|Yet therein is the problem.
p336_094|p336|It's hard to see it.
p336_080|p336|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p336_269|p336|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p336_255|p336|I can understand why they have gone.
p336_241|p336|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p336_296|p336|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p336_282|p336|I watch the other visitors.
p336_309|p336|We have chosen for the patients.
p336_321|p336|Nobody should believe this story.
p336_335|p336|Not because they want to sing about something.
p336_123|p336|These figures are truly awful.
p336_137|p336|There is nothing like this back home.
p336_193|p336|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p336_187|p336|Cloning is not ready.
p336_178|p336|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p336_150|p336|It's good for the city.
p336_144|p336|He's got me very well.
p336_391|p336|It left me with a sadness.
p336_385|p336|We were beaten by the better team today.
p336_408|p336|As if he would.
p336_352|p336|But it was fun.
p336_346|p336|He wouldn't do it.
p336_420|p336|What is going on?
p336_226|p336|The biggest resource is our staff.
p336_232|p336|It's not a party, no, no.
p336_018|p336|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p336_024|p336|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p336_030|p336|How could it not?
p336_031|p336|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p336_025|p336|I am very happy with the result.
p336_019|p336|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p336_233|p336|The lads are having a tour.
p336_227|p336|We have big ideas.
p336_347|p336|She becomes a mother.
p336_421|p336|Let that be their memorial.
p336_353|p336|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p336_409|p336|I just carry on with my work.
p336_384|p336|This is the stuff of live music.
p336_390|p336|But this is even worse.
p336_145|p336|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
p336_151|p336|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p336_179|p336|We've got a mixture of both.
p336_186|p336|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p336_192|p336|Don't hold your breath!
p336_184|p336|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
p336_190|p336|The weekly average was three hours.
p336_147|p336|He looked at me before replying.
p336_153|p336|It's like an extension of your body.
p336_386|p336|Taxes may need to rise.
p336_392|p336|I was living with my mum.
p336_379|p336|It may be the first of many.
p336_423|p336|Tonight is very special.
p336_345|p336|That is why we are here.
p336_351|p336|I am not a happy man.
p336_219|p336|I'm not interested in the job.
p336_231|p336|Cars are great for going long distances.
p336_225|p336|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p336_033|p336|We are proud of them.
p336_027|p336|It is deeply worrying.
p336_026|p336|She took them for a term.
p336_032|p336|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
p336_224|p336|It's the last thing on my mind.
p336_230|p336|I wish him well for the future.
p336_218|p336|We have been through this with the lawyers.
p336_350|p336|Bomber was not amused.
p336_422|p336|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p336_344|p336|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p336_378|p336|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p336_393|p336|The truth is he probably doesn't.
p336_387|p336|It's unusual to say the least.
p336_152|p336|Controllers major concern is safety.
p336_146|p336|He was always nice to me.
p336_191|p336|Is there a new way forward?
p336_185|p336|They are now out in the cold.
p336_181|p336|This is not the case.
p336_195|p336|Safety is our first concern.
p336_142|p336|This is the man who provides the hope.
p336_156|p336|We have waited a long time for this.
p336_383|p336|We are looking very hard at ourselves.
p336_397|p336|She is having an affair with his partner.
p336_340|p336|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
p336_354|p336|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p336_368|p336|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p336_234|p336|It may not be life long.
p336_220|p336|His contract was then not renewed.
p336_208|p336|So, where do we go from here?
p336_036|p336|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p336_022|p336|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p336_023|p336|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
p336_037|p336|That incident altered the pattern of the game.
p336_209|p336|The claim was denied by the first minister.
p336_221|p336|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p336_235|p336|Everyone was in tears.
p336_369|p336|Eriksson would have approved.
p336_355|p336|It's been such a waste of money.
p336_396|p336|And then he laughs.
p336_382|p336|I spoke to him yesterday.
p336_157|p336|I want my audience to be challenged.
p336_143|p336|This is a war over our home.
p336_194|p336|Where do you think she is going?
p336_180|p336|I'm very happy to be here.
p336_196|p336|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p336_182|p336|This one was supposed to be so different.
p336_155|p336|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p336_141|p336|We need to be more specific.
p336_169|p336|He is married with three children.
p336_394|p336|There were few surprises.
p336_380|p336|It runs in cycles.
p336_357|p336|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p336_343|p336|The work was suspended following the kidnap.
p336_419|p336|Would he ever go back to the beginning?
p336_223|p336|I came here this week to work.
p336_237|p336|These were the dreams.
p336_021|p336|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p336_035|p336|It was another good idea.
p336_009|p336|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p336_008|p336|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p336_034|p336|We had a really good experience with David.
p336_020|p336|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p336_236|p336|It was just above the roof.
p336_222|p336|The warnings were a good reminder.
p336_418|p336|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p336_424|p336|This is a matter of life and death.
p336_356|p336|Not so, it transpires.
p336_381|p336|It is already making a difference.
p336_395|p336|He is a one-off.
p336_168|p336|Their vision was not impeded.
p336_140|p336|We did not have a clue.
p336_154|p336|Because he usually is.
p336_183|p336|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p336_197|p336|Inspections are not the problem.
p364_042|p364|Since then it has become a tradition.
p364_056|p364|Our commitment is to move forward.
p364_283|p364|It is a victory to that extent.
p364_297|p364|It was just one man.
p364_268|p364|I have got to keep the lid on.
p364_240|p364|It had happened to him.
p364_254|p364|We can do it.
p364_308|p364|They were very responsive.
p364_136|p364|But he's a very quiet man.
p364_122|p364|This decision is a victory for common sense.
p364_123|p364|One is too many.
p364_137|p364|Destruction came from within.
p364_309|p364|We're talking to him.
p364_255|p364|This is as bad as it gets.
p364_241|p364|That is our business.
p364_269|p364|Or so we thought.
p364_282|p364|It would be dangerous to resign.
p364_057|p364|Partly, it is his own fault.
p364_043|p364|The concept is simple.
p364_094|p364|They have not seen her for years.
p364_096|p364|Allison is not convinced.
p364_082|p364|No-one has spoken to me.
p364_069|p364|It lasted longer than we thought.
p364_055|p364|The president took offence.
p364_041|p364|We welcome the ministers decision.
p364_294|p364|When he got up he was hit again.
p364_280|p364|We have to get on with it.
p364_257|p364|That can happen so easily.
p364_243|p364|The car driver was not injured.
p364_109|p364|Success in Scotland is important.
p364_121|p364|It is part of their job.
p364_135|p364|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p364_134|p364|I love a clever reader.
p364_120|p364|Who will take them after that?
p364_108|p364|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p364_242|p364|We were completely outplayed.
p364_256|p364|The real issue is personal.
p364_281|p364|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
p364_040|p364|I thought it was the only way out.
p364_054|p364|There is no doubt about that.
p364_068|p364|I see no need to change.
p364_083|p364|His arrival could be the making of them.
p364_097|p364|He felt there was no case to answer.
p364_087|p364|I support the stand that they are making.
p364_050|p364|What do you think they said?
p364_044|p364|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p364_078|p364|Scotland were on Saturday.
p364_291|p364|We have no knowledge of this.
p364_285|p364|I certainly hope so.
p364_252|p364|It was a nightmare.
p364_246|p364|I believe in having difficult times.
p364_124|p364|What can you say?
p364_130|p364|The timing is wrong.
p364_118|p364|It has been a great success.
p364_119|p364|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p364_131|p364|That's why he is a national treasure.
p364_125|p364|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p364_247|p364|Stand by for action.
p364_253|p364|But this is just the first step.
p364_284|p364|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p364_290|p364|I have been here for only three months.
p364_079|p364|He wanted to talk to me about it.
p364_045|p364|And that's the trouble with this business.
p364_051|p364|There will be no disruption in the schools.
p364_086|p364|I said How much?
p364_092|p364|But this has already been rejected.
p364_084|p364|I was close enough.
p364_090|p364|Nature will not find its own level.
p364_047|p364|We must not give in to bastards.
p364_053|p364|I can live with that.
p364_286|p364|She died later on Monday.
p364_292|p364|I was the willing journeyman.
p364_245|p364|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p364_251|p364|It was really surprising.
p364_279|p364|He made no comment.
p364_133|p364|He will be fine.
p364_127|p364|He was extremely ill.
p364_126|p364|The money all appears to be gone.
p364_132|p364|He just attracted people.
p364_278|p364|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p364_250|p364|We just need the Government to act.
p364_244|p364|It was a surprising decision.
p364_293|p364|I know we ask a lot of you.
p364_287|p364|It does and it doesn't.
p364_046|p364|So what did he do?
p364_091|p364|I didn't have the choice.
p364_085|p364|He dismissed the action.
p364_009|p364|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p364_021|p364|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p364_035|p364|It shouldn't be a problem.
p364_223|p364|It would also delay the Scottish results.
p364_237|p364|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p364_196|p364|I put the drawing down.
p364_182|p364|We will see how he is.
p364_169|p364|I hope that doesn't happen.
p364_155|p364|It has paid off.
p364_141|p364|New investment will be openly tendered.
p364_140|p364|It won the match.
p364_154|p364|Everyone would have been happy.
p364_168|p364|One-third of the places are already taken.
p364_183|p364|He had a horror.
p364_197|p364|The hearing continues today.
p364_236|p364|Thankfully they liked it.
p364_222|p364|What do you do.
p364_034|p364|The man has already had too many chances.
p364_020|p364|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p364_008|p364|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p364_036|p364|It was very moving, actually.
p364_022|p364|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p364_208|p364|I am really, really happy.
p364_234|p364|It was all over for us then.
p364_220|p364|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p364_181|p364|It's part of your life.
p364_195|p364|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
p364_142|p364|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
p364_156|p364|Ferguson had done his homework.
p364_157|p364|He deserved that much.
p364_143|p364|It is sponsored by The Herald.
p364_194|p364|And there are different perspectives.
p364_180|p364|Our children are our future.
p364_221|p364|I had no choice.
p364_235|p364|They were assured that it would.
p364_209|p364|This is perfectly legal.
p364_023|p364|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p364_037|p364|It isn't a free-for-all.
p364_033|p364|We're not either of those things.
p364_027|p364|That would be a big step forward.
p364_231|p364|I could not believe the results.
p364_225|p364|We just have to improve.
p364_219|p364|It was very, very frightening.
p364_184|p364|So it was in politics.
p364_190|p364|The state is controlled by the left.
p364_147|p364|I would say so.
p364_153|p364|I don't think it is the case.
p364_152|p364|It is an absolute disgrace.
p364_146|p364|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p364_191|p364|The principle is quite clear.
p364_185|p364|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p364_218|p364|I had a son.
p364_224|p364|This one would have been.
p364_230|p364|There is nothing wrong with that.
p364_026|p364|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p364_032|p364|It is not a matter of concern.
p364_024|p364|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p364_030|p364|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
p364_018|p364|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p364_226|p364|It hasn't worked out that way.
p364_232|p364|What do you do?
p364_193|p364|I would say the risk is very small.
p364_187|p364|The matter has been reported to the police.
p364_150|p364|Do not listen to them.
p364_144|p364|I don't entirely buy that.
p364_178|p364|We want him to continue that way.
p364_179|p364|But he did not rule out further talks.
p364_145|p364|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
p364_151|p364|It was too soon.
p364_192|p364|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
p364_233|p364|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
p364_227|p364|This is very good news.
p364_019|p364|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p364_031|p364|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364_025|p364|Is that not pathetic?
p364_028|p364|I love you so very much.
p364_014|p364|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p364_202|p364|The attitude was good today.
p364_216|p364|It's better to be happy.
p364_148|p364|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p364_174|p364|This has been fantastic.
p364_160|p364|He has gone back to school.
p364_161|p364|It is not illegal.
p364_175|p364|I'm delighted for the lads.
p364_149|p364|It's a good story.
p364_217|p364|It's happened, but it's a dream.
p364_203|p364|I've got nothing to say.
p364_015|p364|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p364_001|p364|Please call Stella.
p364_029|p364|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p364_017|p364|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p364_003|p364|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p364_229|p364|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p364_215|p364|I believe it would have been successful.
p364_201|p364|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p364_188|p364|We are at war.
p364_163|p364|There was nothing anyone could do.
p364_177|p364|It's very very frustrating.
p364_176|p364|I learned that only yesterday.
p364_162|p364|I don't know where it went.
p364_189|p364|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
p364_200|p364|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p364_214|p364|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
p364_228|p364|Is it a warning to parents?
p364_002|p364|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p364_016|p364|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p364_012|p364|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p364_006|p364|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p364_210|p364|I'm not interested in money.
p364_204|p364|It requires a wider team.
p364_238|p364|We just do not do it.
p364_199|p364|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
p364_166|p364|Now they have to do something about it.
p364_172|p364|We must do that.
p364_173|p364|England will be under a lot of pressure.
p364_167|p364|The post will be unpaid.
p364_198|p364|You would be wrong.
p364_239|p364|It was a long time coming.
p364_205|p364|It is so beautiful.
p364_211|p364|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
p364_007|p364|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p364_013|p364|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p364_005|p364|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p364_011|p364|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p364_039|p364|I was not fit enough and it showed.
p364_207|p364|In many ways it was disastrous.
p364_213|p364|I am happy to be here.
p364_171|p364|You will never replace the child.
p364_165|p364|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
p364_159|p364|Mr Blair defended his wife.
p364_158|p364|We want to know about the policy.
p364_164|p364|I don't want to use the term.
p364_170|p364|It's all happening at a local level.
p364_212|p364|I can handle the pace.
p364_206|p364|It is suitable and sensible.
p364_038|p364|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
p364_010|p364|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p364_004|p364|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p364_088|p364|The couple had one daughter.
p364_063|p364|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
p364_077|p364|Who is he?
p364_249|p364|He deserves a top team.
p364_261|p364|It does not take much.
p364_275|p364|Horses have some sense.
p364_301|p364|Is he any good?
p364_117|p364|It was an important part of the course.
p364_103|p364|Our legal advice is clear.
p364_102|p364|This takes the pressure off.
p364_116|p364|It's an old story.
p364_300|p364|I really want to win in Glasgow.
p364_274|p364|We are keen to have him back.
p364_260|p364|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p364_248|p364|It was something special.
p364_076|p364|You see - this business is a good one.
p364_062|p364|You make the choice.
p364_089|p364|But was it really so big?
p364_048|p364|The trial will open today.
p364_074|p364|This was a massive result for us.
p364_060|p364|Why has it taken so long?
p364_289|p364|We suspect he was pleased.
p364_276|p364|It goes in cycles.
p364_262|p364|It would be a bonus for this game.
p364_302|p364|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p364_128|p364|This time, it was not be.
p364_100|p364|Lots of others were doing the same.
p364_114|p364|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p364_115|p364|We don't know what is happening to them.
p364_101|p364|It is still holding good today.
p364_129|p364|They are unable to say anything.
p364_303|p364|It was then that Rangers scored.
p364_263|p364|I've seen it work already.
p364_277|p364|And now he has decided, enough.
p364_288|p364|It will not be today, though.
p364_061|p364|No-one knows the numbers.
p364_075|p364|It's not in my nature.
p364_049|p364|But it didn't happen.
p364_071|p364|They made a huge impression on me.
p364_065|p364|It's not going to work.
p364_059|p364|The family is so happy for him.
p364_298|p364|It's going to be tough.
p364_273|p364|It's great fun to get to act.
p364_267|p364|We try to keep it right.
p364_105|p364|This is a horrible loss.
p364_111|p364|I know the worry over Iraq.
p364_138|p364|It's not their fault.
p364_110|p364|We could do a lot worse.
p364_104|p364|But he has a lifeline.
p364_306|p364|Sub Not Used, McKee.
p364_266|p364|This could be the case.
p364_272|p364|It was a definite penalty.
p364_299|p364|You will be very, very welcome.
p364_058|p364|That's where it all started.
p364_064|p364|I knew the script.
p364_070|p364|They've got more time.
p364_099|p364|He liked to talk.
p364_066|p364|He leaves a beat.
p364_072|p364|There is no hiding place.
p364_264|p364|Do you mean today?
p364_270|p364|For many, it had become a fact of life.
p364_258|p364|We deserved to get the victory today.
p364_304|p364|This was repeated the second time.
p364_112|p364|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p364_106|p364|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p364_107|p364|We are not leaving the area.
p364_113|p364|It was just great.
p364_305|p364|I chose the former.
p364_259|p364|That's the last thing he will do.
p364_271|p364|Last season was very hard for me.
p364_265|p364|Israeli forces denied the claim.
p364_073|p364|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p364_067|p364|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p364_098|p364|This is a one-off.
p363_214|p363|This is not a monument to the past.
p363_002|p363|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p363_016|p363|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p363_176|p363|Her body has never been found.
p363_162|p363|The baby deserves the credit.
p363_189|p363|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p363_348|p363|The world is being invited to visit.
p363_374|p363|There is nothing to fear.
p363_412|p363|It was not even this century.
p363_406|p363|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
p363_360|p363|We're going to sleep.
p363_407|p363|There's nothing she can't do.
p363_361|p363|It raises a serious question mark.
p363_375|p363|Just look at his record.
p363_413|p363|That was really tough.
p363_349|p363|Nobody was able to escape.
p363_188|p363|THERE's only one word for it.
p363_163|p363|I live for today.
p363_177|p363|It is all credit to them today.
p363_017|p363|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p363_003|p363|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p363_215|p363|We can all understand that.
p363_201|p363|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p363_229|p363|Well, we know now.
p363_217|p363|I was amazed at her knowledge.
p363_203|p363|I really had to concentrate.
p363_029|p363|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p363_015|p363|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p363_001|p363|Please call Stella.
p363_149|p363|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p363_161|p363|I feel a little betrayed.
p363_175|p363|Scotland won by six wickets.
p363_363|p363|It was great fun.
p363_405|p363|This is your chance.
p363_411|p363|He died in September.
p363_377|p363|It is a memorial.
p363_388|p363|I am enjoying it.
p363_389|p363|It wasn't very pretty to watch.
p363_410|p363|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p363_376|p363|He was a legend.
p363_362|p363|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p363_404|p363|She doesn't know where to begin.
p363_174|p363|The only trouble is finding them.
p363_160|p363|He said it was his greatest work.
p363_148|p363|It would be a masterclass.
p363_014|p363|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p363_028|p363|The proposals were not new.
p363_202|p363|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p363_216|p363|You are going to have to do it.
p363_212|p363|We got on very well.
p363_206|p363|The training will take place in Downing Street.
p363_010|p363|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p363_004|p363|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p363_038|p363|The captaincy will help that, too.
p363_164|p363|I have been very stupid.
p363_170|p363|So what's in store?
p363_158|p363|This is a big game for them.
p363_366|p363|It is not needed, it should go.
p363_372|p363|I think we did well.
p363_414|p363|It's not going to last five minutes.
p363_399|p363|There is a lack of logic.
p363_398|p363|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p363_373|p363|Only two things are certain.
p363_415|p363|I am happy with my form.
p363_401|p363|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p363_367|p363|She had not suffered any physical injury.
p363_159|p363|We still have to wait for that.
p363_171|p363|He didn't know where to look.
p363_165|p363|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p363_039|p363|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p363_005|p363|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p363_011|p363|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p363_207|p363|We have still got the fight in us.
p363_213|p363|I think it must be the uniforms.
p363_205|p363|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p363_211|p363|A senior party insider said.
p363_239|p363|I'm so looking forward to it.
p363_007|p363|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p363_013|p363|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p363_173|p363|There are two characters.
p363_167|p363|But that was his nature.
p363_198|p363|I don't think it's the area.
p363_417|p363|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p363_371|p363|However, it was well worth the wait.
p363_365|p363|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p363_403|p363|It is a large number.
p363_359|p363|They never seem to do anything about it.
p363_358|p363|But it is a fact.
p363_364|p363|Experience in this work is paramount.
p363_402|p363|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p363_416|p363|That's the name of the game, though.
p363_370|p363|And there are others.
p363_199|p363|Well, you might have a point.
p363_166|p363|My father and mother are.
p363_172|p363|The German had a point to make.
p363_012|p363|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p363_006|p363|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p363_238|p363|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p363_210|p363|I wanted to have a go.
p363_204|p363|We didn't want any trouble.
p363_263|p363|He was travelling to see his daughter.
p363_277|p363|He is certainly not looking for another job.
p363_288|p363|The Believer isn't just a movie.
p363_049|p363|I was not overly concerned about this.
p363_061|p363|He is not alone.
p363_075|p363|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p363_129|p363|Look at the turn-out.
p363_115|p363|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p363_101|p363|I can't get it.
p363_317|p363|Her concerns were not without foundation.
p363_303|p363|But they have the sound.
p363_302|p363|It was not the right time for me.
p363_316|p363|They want to win the title.
p363_100|p363|We talk about effective military action.
p363_114|p363|I hope the couples are still together.
p363_128|p363|We are getting not a penny.
p363_074|p363|We are not commenting at the moment.
p363_060|p363|What's the problem?
p363_048|p363|He will never be forgotten.
p363_289|p363|You are looking at him.
p363_276|p363|Can you believe it?
p363_262|p363|Where was the point in all this?
p363_248|p363|He is to be commended.
p363_274|p363|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p363_260|p363|Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
p363_076|p363|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363_062|p363|He did that last Sunday.
p363_089|p363|It was decided he should be dismissed.
p363_102|p363|It was entirely justified.
p363_116|p363|But that is not enough.
p363_328|p363|The United Nations must act.
p363_300|p363|How do you feel?
p363_314|p363|I'm a bit overwhelmed.
p363_315|p363|The Old Firm are growing.
p363_301|p363|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p363_329|p363|They haven't got a hope.
p363_117|p363|These people are helpless.
p363_103|p363|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p363_088|p363|It has come a long way since then.
p363_063|p363|There wasn't anything in it.
p363_077|p363|He is slightly confused.
p363_261|p363|They may not always be so lucky.
p363_275|p363|Now we have had enough.
p363_249|p363|I can hardly believe it.
p363_271|p363|That should not be their conclusion.
p363_265|p363|This is the root of their problems.
p363_259|p363|It is not a soap opera.
p363_073|p363|It was just an accident.
p363_067|p363|It was far from business as usual.
p363_098|p363|It was good fun.
p363_107|p363|I am the head.
p363_113|p363|That was certainly the case for the parties.
p363_305|p363|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p363_311|p363|There is another side to it.
p363_339|p363|I am feeling on top of the world.
p363_338|p363|It seems to go down well.
p363_310|p363|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p363_304|p363|Not all women are dismayed.
p363_112|p363|I sit at home a lot.
p363_106|p363|He had never run the distance before.
p363_099|p363|This is a great shame.
p363_066|p363|Lovely day isn't it?
p363_072|p363|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p363_258|p363|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p363_264|p363|It's an hour of the same response.
p363_270|p363|However, that is not in itself enough.
p363_266|p363|Two other men have recovered.
p363_272|p363|We're going to fight it.
p363_299|p363|He will have it within two weeks.
p363_064|p363|The club is afflicted by injuries.
p363_070|p363|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p363_058|p363|We were upset about the referee.
p363_110|p363|It's harder, believe me.
p363_104|p363|It's somewhere in between.
p363_138|p363|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p363_312|p363|His remit is specific.
p363_306|p363|It is not just in Edinburgh.
p363_307|p363|It's never happened before.
p363_313|p363|It will be very damaging for research.
p363_139|p363|Changes need to be made.
p363_105|p363|The play was to go straight ahead.
p363_111|p363|We are making no comment.
p363_059|p363|That is our objective.
p363_071|p363|This is a judgment issue.
p363_065|p363|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363_298|p363|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p363_273|p363|The plot is minimal.
p363_267|p363|It will be a challenging film.
p363_242|p363|It was an excellent performance.
p363_256|p363|All winners should be tested.
p363_281|p363|Then there was her childhood.
p363_295|p363|It should be equal.
p363_068|p363|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p363_040|p363|I think we're a long way forward.
p363_054|p363|That is why this action has been taken.
p363_083|p363|I have never seen anything like this.
p363_097|p363|She is still very poorly.
p363_108|p363|He is obviously very dangerous.
p363_134|p363|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p363_120|p363|It would be really interesting if they did.
p363_336|p363|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p363_322|p363|You have no chance of planning permission.
p363_323|p363|That is taking place in Strathclyde.
p363_337|p363|I just had to go for it.
p363_121|p363|That takes a lot of courage.
p363_135|p363|There were no reports of casualties.
p363_109|p363|It can be very worrying.
p363_096|p363|Where will the money come from?
p363_082|p363|That can only be a good thing.
p363_055|p363|Who will pay for this?
p363_041|p363|The impact was immediate.
p363_069|p363|The show is not over.
p363_294|p363|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p363_280|p363|The gap is closing.
p363_257|p363|We would like to see them in court.
p363_243|p363|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p363_269|p363|She is under police escort.
p363_255|p363|I was brought up in a mining background.
p363_241|p363|That ignorance is crucial.
p363_296|p363|It will make a big difference.
p363_282|p363|Other people had looked at it.
p363_057|p363|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363_043|p363|His film is not.
p363_094|p363|What has happened?
p363_080|p363|All the time, that number was coming down and down.
p363_123|p363|Motorists will welcome this.
p363_137|p363|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p363_309|p363|Norton was delighted with his successes.
p363_321|p363|It was blown out of proportion.
p363_335|p363|I've never regretted coming here.
p363_334|p363|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p363_320|p363|My view has now completely changed.
p363_308|p363|It was a deeper deception.
p363_136|p363|But it's a subtle process.
p363_122|p363|Sadly, it is not to be.
p363_081|p363|There is room for me.
p363_095|p363|If they are not, the commission will take action.
p363_042|p363|There is a new confidence about the club.
p363_056|p363|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p363_283|p363|And the other winners are.
p363_297|p363|I want to make a difference.
p363_240|p363|I think we can do well.
p363_254|p363|We stopped at half-time.
p363_268|p363|The test case is still awaiting action.
p363_250|p363|The goals will come.
p363_244|p363|Clearly, there was a mix-up.
p363_278|p363|I have a problem with these things.
p363_293|p363|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p363_287|p363|I believe he could have turned it around.
p363_052|p363|But real life is not like that.
p363_046|p363|That is good news.
p363_091|p363|We have not given up.
p363_085|p363|It was that kind of war.
p363_126|p363|he announced his plans.
p363_132|p363|There was something special about that.
p363_324|p363|He was in a mood.
p363_330|p363|He was a national treasure.
p363_318|p363|This decision is a farce.
p363_319|p363|That would be the constructive way forward.
p363_331|p363|I think they are right to be impatient.
p363_325|p363|Was this element always there?
p363_133|p363|Many other areas are coming up.
p363_127|p363|He is the man to beat.
p363_084|p363|They are difficult awards to decide.
p363_090|p363|But someone has got to do it.
p363_047|p363|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p363_053|p363|So now we know.
p363_286|p363|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p363_292|p363|It was an achievement all right.
p363_245|p363|I have not had much of him.
p363_251|p363|I don't feel like working.
p363_247|p363|We are taking no chances this time.
p363_253|p363|I sit in the car.
p363_284|p363|It was quite a sight.
p363_290|p363|The best team won.
p363_045|p363|In my experience, he does not do that.
p363_051|p363|The nation has his music.
p363_079|p363|The course has helped a lot.
p363_086|p363|That is my preference.
p363_092|p363|It was the turning point of the afternoon.
p363_131|p363|It is very simple.
p363_125|p363|This is not a problem.
p363_119|p363|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p363_333|p363|I must make that clear.
p363_327|p363|He was the architect.
p363_326|p363|This is an awful lot of money.
p363_332|p363|We need to regroup.
p363_118|p363|I wish him well.
p363_124|p363|I welcome this Bill.
p363_130|p363|Which brings us to the question of money.
p363_093|p363|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p363_087|p363|He later told The Herald, It is true.
p363_078|p363|We did not deserve to go through.
p363_050|p363|He was very grateful for his health.
p363_044|p363|It is the strength of the school.
p363_291|p363|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
p363_285|p363|But he was far from alone.
p363_252|p363|Then one day it happened.
p363_246|p363|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p363_209|p363|This is really good news for us.
p363_221|p363|We don't want that at all.
p363_235|p363|Will you just put it away?
p363_023|p363|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p363_037|p363|It's on with a roller.
p363_157|p363|It appears to have been successful.
p363_143|p363|Maybe it will work there.
p363_194|p363|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p363_180|p363|Will he be here for the weekend?
p363_369|p363|We have been overwhelmed by the response.
p363_355|p363|One might think that it is a power.
p363_341|p363|I don't know, really.
p363_396|p363|He will have something to say.
p363_382|p363|It is something that we would support.
p363_383|p363|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p363_397|p363|You can't take a chance.
p363_354|p363|I am not sure.
p363_368|p363|We have a business to run.
p363_181|p363|He can do everything.
p363_195|p363|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p363_142|p363|I was deeply worried.
p363_156|p363|We have been extremely busy.
p363_036|p363|It certainly is cause for concern.
p363_022|p363|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p363_234|p363|I can do this on my own.
p363_220|p363|Ours is on for two days.
p363_208|p363|That decision is now being appealed.
p363_236|p363|I think it's more important to have fun.
p363_222|p363|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p363_008|p363|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p363_034|p363|It's not an improvement for him.
p363_020|p363|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p363_168|p363|We have been together for five years.
p363_140|p363|Things are going well.
p363_154|p363|His body was never found.
p363_183|p363|Public safety is paramount.
p363_197|p363|I wanted to get on with it.
p363_418|p363|Overall, it has certainly worked out.
p363_356|p363|This place is outstanding.
p363_381|p363|The challenge is to win a cup.
p363_395|p363|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p363_394|p363|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p363_380|p363|We were very unhappy with the incident.
p363_357|p363|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p363_343|p363|Therefore there is a threat.
p363_419|p363|This is actually true.
p363_196|p363|A decision is expected tomorrow.
p363_182|p363|Now is the time for action.
p363_155|p363|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p363_141|p363|Hard it will be.
p363_169|p363|They would never let him go.
p363_021|p363|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p363_035|p363|I think it is wide open.
p363_009|p363|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p363_223|p363|The group will report back in the summer.
p363_237|p363|By then it was too late.
p363_233|p363|All were later allowed home.
p363_227|p363|They know nothing about the sport.
p363_031|p363|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363_025|p363|It's never been to committee.
p363_019|p363|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p363_145|p363|We could easily have lost that game.
p363_151|p363|They will not be going back.
p363_179|p363|Perhaps it was just as well.
p363_186|p363|He had an apartment ready.
p363_192|p363|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p363_421|p363|It could have taken another two months.
p363_347|p363|Gritty he did not want.
p363_353|p363|I only found out about it this morning.
p363_409|p363|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
p363_384|p363|We are in shock.
p363_390|p363|You have to go for it.
p363_391|p363|Are these immoral?
p363_385|p363|Does it really matter?
p363_408|p363|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p363_352|p363|He was later deported.
p363_420|p363|Both were reduced to rubble.
p363_346|p363|You did not see it.
p363_193|p363|Their appeal will be heard this week.
p363_187|p363|The prime minister will make the decision.
p363_178|p363|That was a huge experience.
p363_150|p363|I didn't really expect to be called up.
p363_144|p363|How does it all work?
p363_018|p363|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p363_024|p363|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p363_030|p363|His party never arrived.
p363_226|p363|That in itself is a joke.
p363_232|p363|The legal process could last weeks.
p363_224|p363|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p363_230|p363|He was only doing his job.
p363_218|p363|Where is the evidence?
p363_026|p363|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p363_032|p363|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p363_152|p363|The progress has been steady.
p363_146|p363|There's a lot of it going on.
p363_191|p363|That is European law.
p363_185|p363|They were not consulted.
p363_350|p363|Surely the answer is yes.
p363_344|p363|She would love it.
p363_422|p363|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
p363_378|p363|I have no evidence.
p363_393|p363|It is for the same reason.
p363_387|p363|A decision is expected today.
p363_386|p363|I loved it - and so did my friend.
p363_392|p363|It has been a massive success.
p363_379|p363|But is he?
p363_345|p363|One was taken to hospital.
p363_423|p363|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p363_351|p363|Secondly, there is the question of money.
p363_184|p363|I feel really confident in that department.
p363_190|p363|It was far more important than that.
p363_147|p363|I doubt it would be genuine.
p363_153|p363|It has no chance.
p363_033|p363|He gave no other details.
p363_027|p363|It was actually very, very difficult.
p363_219|p363|It was important in training terms.
p363_231|p363|They chose the latter.
p363_225|p363|We don't come here for our health.
p308_029|p308|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p308_203|p308|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p308_217|p308|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p308_388|p308|We've got to get it right.
p308_411|p308|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p308_377|p308|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p308_363|p308|It's not easy to live in Russia.
p308_405|p308|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p308_175|p308|It is time to come into the limelight.
p308_161|p308|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p308_149|p308|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p308_148|p308|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p308_160|p308|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p308_174|p308|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p308_362|p308|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p308_404|p308|I leave tonight for England.
p308_410|p308|There are simply no orders.
p308_376|p308|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
p308_389|p308|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
p308_216|p308|A judicial review is also being considered.
p308_202|p308|I've never been limited on drugs.
p308_028|p308|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p308_014|p308|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p308_016|p308|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p308_002|p308|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p308_214|p308|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p308_200|p308|They had not been handcuffed.
p308_228|p308|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p308_406|p308|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p308_360|p308|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p308_374|p308|We're not comparing like with like.
p308_412|p308|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p308_348|p308|Everything else is a bonus.
p308_189|p308|People buy everything with cash.
p308_162|p308|The red card was okay.
p308_176|p308|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p308_177|p308|His name is Michael Owen.
p308_163|p308|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p308_188|p308|I'm really proud of my young players.
p308_349|p308|The hotel was now for sale.
p308_375|p308|Ferguson should take note.
p308_413|p308|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p308_407|p308|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p308_361|p308|They have not let anyone into the loop.
p308_229|p308|It is something that we will put right.
p308_201|p308|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p308_215|p308|Is this accurate?
p308_003|p308|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p308_017|p308|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p308_013|p308|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p308_007|p308|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p308_239|p308|They follow him everywhere.
p308_211|p308|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p308_205|p308|We have chosen for the patients.
p308_359|p308|The discussions will surely not last too long.
p308_365|p308|Last night was a key episode.
p308_403|p308|It's a very high number.
p308_417|p308|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p308_371|p308|We have fun in our lives.
p308_198|p308|This must be kept in total perspective.
p308_167|p308|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p308_173|p308|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p308_172|p308|And now he tells us.
p308_166|p308|I was doing well at the hustings.
p308_199|p308|All of the names are familiar to me.
p308_416|p308|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p308_370|p308|I am content with the silver.
p308_364|p308|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p308_402|p308|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p308_358|p308|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p308_204|p308|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p308_210|p308|I was surprised by his response.
p308_238|p308|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p308_006|p308|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p308_012|p308|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p308_038|p308|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p308_004|p308|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p308_010|p308|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p308_206|p308|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p308_212|p308|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p308_399|p308|It remains in public ownership.
p308_372|p308|This, too, could prove a risky business.
p308_414|p308|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p308_400|p308|The Master was by then just too old.
p308_366|p308|I grew up listening to these people.
p308_158|p308|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p308_170|p308|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p308_164|p308|But they will not be compelled to join.
p308_165|p308|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p308_171|p308|There is no date on this document.
p308_159|p308|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p308_401|p308|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p308_367|p308|It is normal for me.
p308_373|p308|You have to audition for jobs.
p308_415|p308|She took them for a term.
p308_398|p308|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p308_213|p308|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p308_207|p308|Why should we even be asked to share?
p308_011|p308|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p308_005|p308|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p308_039|p308|All of us do.
p308_089|p308|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p308_062|p308|He said it was the worst possible result.
p308_076|p308|You do have a way out.
p308_260|p308|I started on fire a couple of times.
p308_274|p308|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p308_248|p308|He should be a great asset.
p308_314|p308|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p308_300|p308|The frustration was showing.
p308_328|p308|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p308_116|p308|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p308_102|p308|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p308_103|p308|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p308_117|p308|I want to play at the highest level.
p308_329|p308|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p308_301|p308|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p308_315|p308|It's like the Russians.
p308_249|p308|It means they actually control the programme.
p308_275|p308|That got me out of jail.
p308_261|p308|He also received a medal of honour.
p308_077|p308|It is simple, really.
p308_063|p308|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p308_088|p308|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p308_075|p308|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p308_061|p308|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p308_049|p308|Happily we found it in the library.
p308_288|p308|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p308_277|p308|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p308_263|p308|She said he showed no remorse.
p308_303|p308|My friends were very envious.
p308_317|p308|Let us hope so.
p308_101|p308|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p308_115|p308|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p308_129|p308|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p308_128|p308|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p308_114|p308|It is time for a more honest approach.
p308_100|p308|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p308_316|p308|Is that Titanic?
p308_302|p308|I am a wealthy person.
p308_262|p308|It's not one for the purists.
p308_276|p308|We've turned the corner.
p308_289|p308|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p308_048|p308|What's it got to do with art?
p308_060|p308|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p308_074|p308|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308_058|p308|We must improve our relations with government.
p308_070|p308|But it was to no avail.
p308_064|p308|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p308_299|p308|I really don't understand what is happening.
p308_272|p308|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p308_266|p308|It is a time bomb.
p308_306|p308|We're determined to establish the facts.
p308_312|p308|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p308_138|p308|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p308_104|p308|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p308_110|p308|I hope they understand that.
p308_111|p308|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p308_105|p308|It separates the men from the boys.
p308_139|p308|The singer's condition was not specified.
p308_313|p308|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p308_307|p308|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p308_267|p308|It's a matter of huge concern.
p308_273|p308|And that's good news for the magpies.
p308_298|p308|It all seemed so easy.
p308_065|p308|It is just part of modern day life.
p308_071|p308|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p308_059|p308|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p308_098|p308|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p308_067|p308|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p308_073|p308|That alibi is now gone.
p308_259|p308|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p308_265|p308|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p308_271|p308|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p308_339|p308|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p308_311|p308|It plans to return to this field.
p308_305|p308|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p308_113|p308|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p308_107|p308|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p308_106|p308|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p308_112|p308|She will also get a pay rise.
p308_304|p308|The snipers are also out.
p308_310|p308|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p308_338|p308|You've been a great audience.
p308_270|p308|The outstanding issues are still there.
p308_264|p308|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p308_258|p308|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p308_072|p308|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p308_066|p308|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p308_099|p308|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p308_080|p308|You, the British people, are the boss.
p308_094|p308|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p308_043|p308|Theatre is not a museum.
p308_057|p308|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p308_282|p308|I see no need for change.
p308_296|p308|I've got a young family.
p308_241|p308|There was no safety net.
p308_255|p308|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p308_269|p308|Three years probation is just a joke.
p308_335|p308|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p308_321|p308|My players have no idea about football.
p308_309|p308|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p308_137|p308|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p308_123|p308|Do not go into government buildings.
p308_122|p308|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p308_136|p308|Do you think they would do any better?
p308_308|p308|The list is too long for this piece.
p308_320|p308|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p308_334|p308|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p308_268|p308|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p308_254|p308|We are at a crossroads.
p308_240|p308|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p308_297|p308|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p308_283|p308|Do yourselves a favour.
p308_056|p308|Henry was strong and talented.
p308_042|p308|We are looking for volunteers.
p308_095|p308|There was an element of jealousy.
p308_081|p308|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p308_097|p308|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p308_083|p308|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p308_054|p308|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p308_040|p308|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p308_068|p308|YOU thought it was a headache.
p308_295|p308|We work on the same level.
p308_281|p308|We've taken steps to rectify it.
p308_256|p308|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p308_242|p308|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p308_322|p308|They are there to get people into work.
p308_336|p308|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p308_120|p308|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p308_134|p308|It had been in place since last July.
p308_108|p308|Two and a half million people have died.
p308_109|p308|Or so it would appear.
p308_135|p308|The European Court is our only option.
p308_121|p308|The trial is set for February.
p308_337|p308|There was no hint of bravado.
p308_323|p308|I'm getting long in the tooth.
p308_243|p308|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p308_257|p308|It didn't take long.
p308_280|p308|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p308_294|p308|Is something which we just don't do.
p308_069|p308|I hope we can put it behind us.
p308_041|p308|It could have been just a quick fix.
p308_055|p308|The days of empty promises are over.
p308_082|p308|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p308_096|p308|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p308_092|p308|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p308_086|p308|She could easily have been killed.
p308_079|p308|I was in jail for five years.
p308_051|p308|There was nobody on the roof.
p308_045|p308|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p308_290|p308|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p308_284|p308|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p308_253|p308|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p308_247|p308|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p308_327|p308|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p308_333|p308|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p308_119|p308|It ignores the future.
p308_125|p308|We are still getting signals.
p308_131|p308|I heard some of his remarks.
p308_130|p308|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p308_124|p308|There is only one caveat.
p308_118|p308|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p308_332|p308|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p308_326|p308|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p308_246|p308|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p308_252|p308|We could have got three medals.
p308_285|p308|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p308_291|p308|His is a success story by any standard.
p308_044|p308|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p308_050|p308|I know a lot of people who don't.
p308_078|p308|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p308_087|p308|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p308_093|p308|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p308_085|p308|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p308_091|p308|He was a crazy man.
p308_046|p308|He could face a jail sentence.
p308_052|p308|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p308_287|p308|I'd love to be like Peter.
p308_293|p308|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p308_278|p308|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p308_244|p308|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p308_250|p308|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p308_318|p308|So, the question is, is it any good?
p308_330|p308|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p308_324|p308|They would be wise to do just that.
p308_132|p308|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p308_126|p308|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p308_127|p308|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p308_133|p308|I was just overwhelmed.
p308_325|p308|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p308_331|p308|I'd go to bookshops.
p308_319|p308|I'm getting back up there now.
p308_251|p308|We are not out of touch with politics.
p308_245|p308|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p308_279|p308|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p308_292|p308|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p308_286|p308|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p308_053|p308|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p308_047|p308|They don't take you to mass graves.
p308_090|p308|The same goes for personnel.
p308_084|p308|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p308_020|p308|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p308_034|p308|My game is in pretty good shape.
p308_008|p308|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p308_222|p308|It was a total surprise.
p308_236|p308|There is a club on the rise.
p308_395|p308|I'd never seen a play about me.
p308_381|p308|That is not just my personal view.
p308_356|p308|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p308_342|p308|I just need a bit of luck.
p308_418|p308|Or so she thought.
p308_197|p308|It's not just for classical music.
p308_183|p308|Smith has not let him down.
p308_154|p308|I know you went back this morning.
p308_140|p308|How much of a cop out is that?
p308_168|p308|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p308_169|p308|We must put a marker down.
p308_141|p308|The whole region is in shock.
p308_155|p308|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p308_182|p308|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p308_196|p308|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p308_419|p308|It was another good idea.
p308_343|p308|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p308_357|p308|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p308_380|p308|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p308_394|p308|His condition was stable last night.
p308_237|p308|I had a sense of deja vu.
p308_223|p308|I had enough on.
p308_009|p308|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p308_035|p308|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p308_021|p308|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p308_037|p308|We used to keep our business rates.
p308_023|p308|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p308_235|p308|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p308_221|p308|They make it look very easy.
p308_209|p308|There is great potential on this river.
p308_382|p308|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p308_396|p308|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p308_341|p308|She's a valuable member of the Government.
p308_355|p308|It was a UK-wide report.
p308_369|p308|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p308_180|p308|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p308_194|p308|Or so we have long assumed.
p308_143|p308|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p308_157|p308|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p308_156|p308|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p308_142|p308|It will be the final push.
p308_195|p308|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p308_181|p308|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p308_368|p308|But it may not be all bad news.
p308_354|p308|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p308_340|p308|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p308_397|p308|The report is due out next month.
p308_383|p308|It's like a garage.
p308_208|p308|Which means it matters.
p308_220|p308|Appointed general secretary last September.
p308_234|p308|I'm pleased with the horse.
p308_022|p308|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
p308_036|p308|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p308_032|p308|He is not very big, either.
p308_026|p308|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p308_218|p308|They could go no further forward.
p308_230|p308|Survival is our aim.
p308_224|p308|And we're not there yet.
p308_387|p308|You just have to accept.
p308_393|p308|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p308_378|p308|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p308_344|p308|I always felt they played for me.
p308_422|p308|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p308_350|p308|There are two games to go after that.
p308_185|p308|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p308_191|p308|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p308_146|p308|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p308_152|p308|That sort of thing is long gone.
p308_153|p308|I'm afraid to say anything.
p308_147|p308|I could feel the blood on my face.
p308_190|p308|There was great support all round the route.
p308_184|p308|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p308_351|p308|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p308_345|p308|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p308_423|p308|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p308_379|p308|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p308_392|p308|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p308_386|p308|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
p308_225|p308|No meaningful response was issued.
p308_231|p308|There is no reason at all.
p308_219|p308|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p308_027|p308|Each one has its own system.
p308_033|p308|I've taken to the hills.
p308_019|p308|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p308_025|p308|It does make a big difference.
p308_031|p308|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p308_227|p308|plays in dark blue.
p308_233|p308|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p308_390|p308|His death was a tragic accident.
p308_384|p308|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p308_409|p308|I have no argument with Scotland.
p308_353|p308|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p308_421|p308|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p308_347|p308|The princess has had other health problems.
p308_192|p308|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p308_186|p308|They've two children.
p308_179|p308|I will have to order its destruction.
p308_151|p308|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p308_145|p308|It is a very interesting subject.
p308_144|p308|You were the kidnappers.
p308_150|p308|Debbie Harry was cool.
p308_178|p308|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p308_187|p308|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p308_193|p308|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
p308_420|p308|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p308_346|p308|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p308_352|p308|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p308_408|p308|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p308_385|p308|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p308_391|p308|Would you take them?
p308_232|p308|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p308_226|p308|It is a form of physical exercise.
p308_030|p308|It is a very special city.
p308_024|p308|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p308_018|p308|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330_134|p330|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p330_322|p330|We are all family men with children.
p330_336|p330|Will he be given time?
p330_256|p330|It could have been a hammering by now.
p330_242|p330|You would fall over, he said.
p330_295|p330|There were no formal announcements.
p330_281|p330|I felt really good until Friday.
p330_068|p330|I think it is a release of tension.
p330_054|p330|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p330_040|p330|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p330_097|p330|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p330_083|p330|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p330_082|p330|I am here to play football.
p330_096|p330|What do we do for an encore?
p330_041|p330|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p330_055|p330|Scotland had great assets.
p330_069|p330|This is a most serious matter.
p330_280|p330|Who would take it now, after all this?
p330_294|p330|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p330_243|p330|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p330_257|p330|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330_337|p330|You let a lot of people down.
p330_323|p330|The committee's remit is far reaching.
p330_135|p330|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
p330_121|p330|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p330_109|p330|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p330_137|p330|He was obviously very genuine.
p330_123|p330|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p330_309|p330|We all work for nothing.
p330_335|p330|It could have been just a quick fix.
p330_321|p330|I am very happy with life.
p330_269|p330|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p330_241|p330|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330_255|p330|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p330_282|p330|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p330_296|p330|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p330_043|p330|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p330_057|p330|And thought we would get away with it.
p330_080|p330|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p330_094|p330|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p330_095|p330|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p330_081|p330|An announcement will follow in due course.
p330_056|p330|We shall not forget him.
p330_042|p330|We did not even get a free kick.
p330_297|p330|That was quite an interesting part.
p330_283|p330|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p330_254|p330|That is a break with tradition.
p330_240|p330|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330_268|p330|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p330_320|p330|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p330_334|p330|What are you waiting for?
p330_308|p330|We really need research to help with that.
p330_122|p330|Some people still think she should be English.
p330_136|p330|It will be very useful for us.
p330_132|p330|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p330_126|p330|It's like a high school play.
p330_330|p330|There is a solution, she believes.
p330_324|p330|We've had our problems at the club.
p330_318|p330|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p330_244|p330|They should take their mobile phones.
p330_250|p330|The board of governors must act.
p330_278|p330|It was fit for royalty.
p330_287|p330|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p330_293|p330|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p330_046|p330|They said we were out of touch.
p330_052|p330|He has one son and one daughter.
p330_085|p330|I did not want any damage to us.
p330_091|p330|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p330_090|p330|Everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_084|p330|That is the crunch.
p330_053|p330|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p330_047|p330|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p330_292|p330|Twaddle is a case in point.
p330_286|p330|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p330_279|p330|It is always the same, isn't it?
p330_251|p330|We must all play our part.
p330_245|p330|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p330_319|p330|It's just that we see different things.
p330_325|p330|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p330_331|p330|Yet the data is compelling.
p330_127|p330|He was part of South Africa.
p330_133|p330|We are now in a safe place.
p330_125|p330|Who will perform?
p330_131|p330|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p330_119|p330|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p330_327|p330|I think we showed that after half time.
p330_333|p330|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p330_253|p330|It was to be published next month.
p330_247|p330|They are also exploited by the markets.
p330_290|p330|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p330_284|p330|Equity declined to comment.
p330_051|p330|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p330_045|p330|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p330_079|p330|I could do a better job.
p330_092|p330|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p330_086|p330|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p330_087|p330|It was an easy decision to come here.
p330_093|p330|This will be great for the young lads.
p330_078|p330|The way ahead is not easy.
p330_044|p330|Our decision making was poor.
p330_050|p330|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p330_285|p330|There is precious little middle ground.
p330_291|p330|It's now down in black and white.
p330_246|p330|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
p330_252|p330|I first met him last summer.
p330_332|p330|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p330_326|p330|They were at her bedside when she died.
p330_118|p330|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
p330_130|p330|What do they pay to join the club?
p330_124|p330|Repayment is not part of the game.
p330_143|p330|That is the last thing they need.
p330_157|p330|But it could have been written for her.
p330_180|p330|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
p330_194|p330|No government has that right.
p330_369|p330|We know them as mobile telephones.
p330_341|p330|One person was believed to have been hit.
p330_355|p330|I've got my own ideas.
p330_382|p330|Neither was involved in violence.
p330_396|p330|Then  all was revealed.
p330_209|p330|I will not take you out of context.
p330_235|p330|That is the first thing we need.
p330_221|p330|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p330_037|p330|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p330_023|p330|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p330_022|p330|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p330_036|p330|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p330_220|p330|Ordering online was very easy.
p330_234|p330|To a level which we consider appropriate.
p330_208|p330|We began to walk down.
p330_397|p330|They are interior designers and architects.
p330_383|p330|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p330_354|p330|It is patently true.
p330_340|p330|It would have to be backdated.
p330_368|p330|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p330_195|p330|The luxury has been well used.
p330_181|p330|She is on a life support machine.
p330_156|p330|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p330_142|p330|The answer is with ourselves.
p330_168|p330|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p330_154|p330|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
p330_140|p330|He will be judged by his actions.
p330_197|p330|Billie was yet to be born.
p330_183|p330|Euro The single currency is a fact.
p330_418|p330|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p330_356|p330|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p330_342|p330|It is like being a qualifier again.
p330_395|p330|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p330_381|p330|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p330_222|p330|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p330_236|p330|Will they ever reopen?
p330_008|p330|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p330_020|p330|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p330_034|p330|They could move in at any moment.
p330_035|p330|There were no reported injuries.
p330_021|p330|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p330_009|p330|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p330_237|p330|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p330_223|p330|I think it is a great idea.
p330_380|p330|Debate is not just talk.
p330_394|p330|They will now get that support.
p330_343|p330|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p330_357|p330|They might want to play.
p330_419|p330|This is about the Orange Order.
p330_182|p330|The actor has met with Mandela.
p330_196|p330|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p330_141|p330|No Briton has ever won.
p330_155|p330|His parenthood is called into question.
p330_169|p330|This is not a Scottish problem.
p330_151|p330|They have worked with each other.
p330_145|p330|The results are sometimes contentious.
p330_179|p330|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p330_192|p330|Referees are easy targets.
p330_186|p330|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p330_353|p330|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p330_421|p330|We will do so again.
p330_347|p330|We have to learn lessons from these things.
p330_409|p330|You guys are not out of it yet.
p330_390|p330|The line-up is a tasty one.
p330_384|p330|So people will come out with these things.
p330_227|p330|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p330_233|p330|I never made any offer to Mark.
p330_025|p330|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p330_031|p330|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p330_019|p330|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p330_018|p330|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330_030|p330|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330_024|p330|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p330_232|p330|What happened to me last week was wrong.
p330_226|p330|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p330_385|p330|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p330_391|p330|He was located after going to Singapore.
p330_408|p330|They offer a kind of narrative.
p330_420|p330|But it looks good for next year.
p330_346|p330|She is very upset.
p330_352|p330|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p330_187|p330|He went to see what he could learn.
p330_193|p330|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
p330_178|p330|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p330_144|p330|Was society doing enough?
p330_150|p330|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p330_146|p330|I never thought it would take this long.
p330_152|p330|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p330_185|p330|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p330_191|p330|It has all been positive.
p330_344|p330|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p330_422|p330|It's been a long, long journey.
p330_350|p330|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p330_378|p330|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p330_387|p330|Was it just negligent.
p330_393|p330|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p330_230|p330|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p330_224|p330|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p330_218|p330|You remember how long he lasted?
p330_032|p330|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p330_026|p330|I was backing him up.
p330_027|p330|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p330_033|p330|And it had two seats.
p330_219|p330|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p330_225|p330|But it's just great to have won.
p330_231|p330|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p330_392|p330|She was my big sister.
p330_386|p330|I am not a happy man.
p330_379|p330|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p330_351|p330|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p330_345|p330|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p330_423|p330|I have no problem with that.
p330_190|p330|We're not an employment agency.
p330_184|p330|This is a dream come true for me.
p330_153|p330|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p330_147|p330|He changed my life.
p330_162|p330|The party lasted all night.
p330_176|p330|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p330_189|p330|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330_348|p330|It was a poor performance.
p330_406|p330|We will deal with the refugees.
p330_360|p330|It is simple and easy to use.
p330_374|p330|He wouldn't do it.
p330_412|p330|What is next?
p330_228|p330|All these women were actors.
p330_214|p330|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p330_200|p330|This is a good result for them.
p330_016|p330|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p330_002|p330|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p330_003|p330|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p330_017|p330|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p330_201|p330|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p330_215|p330|It had to be more flexible.
p330_229|p330|I've got no secret.
p330_375|p330|I don't know exactly what happened.
p330_413|p330|Their welfare is very important to us.
p330_407|p330|I am greatly encouraged.
p330_361|p330|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330_349|p330|We are very very proud of Alain.
p330_188|p330|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p330_177|p330|I have no battle with the Scots.
p330_163|p330|I was delighted with every one of them.
p330_149|p330|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330_175|p330|Scotland were beaten again.
p330_161|p330|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p330_411|p330|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p330_377|p330|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p330_363|p330|It is the way they work.
p330_405|p330|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p330_388|p330|That would open the gates of hell.
p330_203|p330|Our message was inclusive.
p330_217|p330|Are there muscular problems?
p330_029|p330|That was their attitude.
p330_001|p330|Please call Stella.
p330_015|p330|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330_014|p330|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p330_028|p330|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p330_216|p330|We are not far from a deal.
p330_202|p330|There was no time scale.
p330_389|p330|If only we had known.
p330_362|p330|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p330_404|p330|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p330_410|p330|What does he want him to look like?
p330_376|p330|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p330_160|p330|A report will be issued by March.
p330_174|p330|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p330_148|p330|There was nothing else to match it.
p330_170|p330|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p330_164|p330|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p330_158|p330|His only reply was a laugh.
p330_372|p330|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p330_414|p330|It's nothing to do with me.
p330_400|p330|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p330_366|p330|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p330_399|p330|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p330_206|p330|That was one very hard game.
p330_212|p330|I'd like to take the plunge.
p330_004|p330|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p330_010|p330|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p330_038|p330|It is my nature.
p330_039|p330|Or so she thought.
p330_011|p330|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p330_005|p330|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p330_213|p330|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p330_207|p330|I think the euro has slipped.
p330_398|p330|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p330_401|p330|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p330_367|p330|I think we finished fifth.
p330_373|p330|He scored a touchdown.
p330_415|p330|She has now been registered as disabled.
p330_159|p330|I'm really looking forward to it.
p330_165|p330|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p330_171|p330|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330_167|p330|I was proud of our lads.
p330_173|p330|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p330_198|p330|She died in hospital two hours later.
p330_365|p330|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p330_403|p330|They had given up on him.
p330_417|p330|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330_371|p330|That's the law of the land.
p330_359|p330|Our people should be immune.
p330_211|p330|The cold war is over.
p330_205|p330|Only the scale of change differed.
p330_239|p330|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p330_013|p330|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p330_007|p330|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p330_006|p330|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p330_012|p330|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p330_238|p330|We have great team spirit.
p330_204|p330|She was right about the struggle.
p330_210|p330|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p330_358|p330|The goal will stay with me forever.
p330_416|p330|You have to work with what you've got.
p330_370|p330|I have chosen to do this research.
p330_364|p330|This was another video cassette.
p330_402|p330|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p330_199|p330|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p330_172|p330|After that, we made some changes.
p330_166|p330|It was horrible, but there is still more.
p330_129|p330|The party will make up its own mind.
p330_101|p330|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p330_115|p330|Seven children had lost both parents.
p330_303|p330|It is quite an eye opener.
p330_317|p330|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p330_277|p330|The film has also been superbly designed.
p330_263|p330|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p330_288|p330|They were both delightful to work with.
p330_049|p330|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p330_075|p330|This is purely financial.
p330_061|p330|I find it rather oppressive.
p330_060|p330|This is a big club.
p330_074|p330|This makes up for it.
p330_048|p330|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p330_289|p330|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p330_262|p330|I played really well on the back nine.
p330_276|p330|I expected these kind of questions.
p330_316|p330|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p330_302|p330|Chris is big and jolly.
p330_114|p330|Some were close to tears.
p330_100|p330|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
p330_128|p330|It's much more dynamic.
p330_116|p330|So, how will it be received in the US?
p330_102|p330|The feeling is marvellous.
p330_328|p330|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p330_314|p330|There's a lot of hysteria.
p330_300|p330|We have to offer value for money.
p330_248|p330|The principle is quite clear.
p330_260|p330|The question is, Is that a negative?
p330_274|p330|All kinds of things occur.
p330_062|p330|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p330_076|p330|I want to help other women.
p330_089|p330|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p330_088|p330|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p330_077|p330|The problem is Labour.
p330_063|p330|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p330_275|p330|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p330_261|p330|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p330_249|p330|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p330_301|p330|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p330_315|p330|The casualties were not named.
p330_329|p330|I am not in denial.
p330_103|p330|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p330_117|p330|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
p330_113|p330|Don't say you have not been warned.
p330_107|p330|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p330_311|p330|He will do very well.
p330_305|p330|They still have the dirty work to do.
p330_339|p330|The result today is an impasse.
p330_265|p330|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p330_271|p330|For this government, reform and resources go together.
p330_259|p330|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p330_067|p330|We gave everything we had.
p330_073|p330|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p330_098|p330|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p330_099|p330|There's nothing for the kids.
p330_072|p330|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p330_066|p330|Others may be trying to catch up.
p330_258|p330|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p330_270|p330|That is our main aim.
p330_264|p330|He will decide tomorrow.
p330_338|p330|It's annoying in a way.
p330_304|p330|It became a national network.
p330_310|p330|It is extremely popular with families.
p330_106|p330|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p330_112|p330|Wallace was in at the deep end.
p330_104|p330|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p330_110|p330|The money is not really our concern.
p330_138|p330|We told them in July.
p330_306|p330|I do not want to wait until May.
p330_312|p330|It was a cry for help.
p330_272|p330|I always knew she was funny.
p330_266|p330|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p330_299|p330|Motion described it as a unique event.
p330_070|p330|I let go the telephone and ran.
p330_064|p330|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p330_058|p330|I think they should have more respect.
p330_059|p330|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p330_065|p330|We have to expand.
p330_071|p330|It is also very valuable.
p330_298|p330|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p330_267|p330|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p330_273|p330|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p330_313|p330|They also intend to travel today.
p330_307|p330|The festival idea has been a great success.
p330_139|p330|It's like a garage.
p330_111|p330|You just know it.
p330_105|p330|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
p339_241|p339|Are you going to win?
p339_296|p339|I have nothing to say on that.
p339_282|p339|No other family members could be contacted.
p339_057|p339|Are they going to work together again?
p339_043|p339|I said to him.
p339_094|p339|He doesn't even know who he is.
p339_080|p339|What is the Barnett formula?
p339_123|p339|But there was everything!
p339_137|p339|It was on fire.
p339_309|p339|She asked for the appointment with me.
p339_321|p339|I would love to do that.
p339_335|p339|We won't do that.
p339_334|p339|No decisions have been taken.
p339_320|p339|That was a fairy tale.
p339_308|p339|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p339_136|p339|I am not inclined to believe it.
p339_122|p339|There could be a possible connection.
p339_081|p339|It all happened so suddenly.
p339_095|p339|It is hard to understand.
p339_042|p339|It was electric, amazing.
p339_056|p339|There are two things we have to do.
p339_283|p339|There is nothing to be gained from that.
p339_297|p339|The rest is his own.
p339_240|p339|The teacher would have approved.
p339_254|p339|It's about taking risks.
p339_268|p339|Should he resign?
p339_242|p339|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339_256|p339|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p339_281|p339|I think it has worked.
p339_295|p339|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p339_068|p339|But summer is spent.
p339_040|p339|What will happen to them today?
p339_054|p339|I will make that point tonight.
p339_083|p339|Or have they?
p339_097|p339|The search is due to be completed today.
p339_108|p339|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p339_134|p339|He will be a major challenger next year.
p339_120|p339|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p339_336|p339|It's the body that counts.
p339_322|p339|You'll have to wait and see.
p339_323|p339|It wasn't the issue.
p339_337|p339|Sprinters are not fit.
p339_121|p339|We're very, very happy.
p339_135|p339|That question was never asked.
p339_109|p339|It was all over now.
p339_096|p339|What will it be?
p339_082|p339|I won't let that happen.
p339_055|p339|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_041|p339|I didn't expect to get one.
p339_069|p339|Services are being expanded, too.
p339_294|p339|But it will not work again.
p339_280|p339|But that's another story.
p339_257|p339|It was indeed a night to remember.
p339_243|p339|I could have been killed on that day.
p339_247|p339|Did it work?
p339_253|p339|We all knew they could do it.
p339_284|p339|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p339_290|p339|And yet, there has been no great impact.
p339_045|p339|he told a producer.
p339_051|p339|It means it is difficult.
p339_079|p339|What we were doing.
p339_086|p339|It will probably be my last, too.
p339_092|p339|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
p339_131|p339|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p339_125|p339|The Scots are great.
p339_119|p339|I thought it was quite good.
p339_333|p339|The problem is fairly serious.
p339_327|p339|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p339_326|p339|We are going to listen to Britain.
p339_332|p339|Well, that was the plan.
p339_118|p339|We have to put this behind us.
p339_124|p339|We are doing very well as we are.
p339_130|p339|It is too much for me.
p339_093|p339|We did it in one take.
p339_087|p339|I am not completely insane.
p339_078|p339|Maybe he will act again.
p339_050|p339|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p339_044|p339|Labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_291|p339|Was that not awful?
p339_285|p339|But do not rely on it.
p339_252|p339|I was very surprised.
p339_246|p339|Now, that would impress the kids.
p339_250|p339|It was not like that at all.
p339_244|p339|They have to come up with a solution.
p339_278|p339|It does nothing for me.
p339_293|p339|I'm not there yet but it is close.
p339_287|p339|What do you want.
p339_052|p339|But they were true stories.
p339_046|p339|That is not the place for her.
p339_091|p339|I decided to take my time.
p339_085|p339|I had a fortunate war.
p339_126|p339|That imbalance was evident in their play.
p339_132|p339|We are still waiting.
p339_324|p339|The number never came.
p339_330|p339|We have expected it.
p339_318|p339|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
p339_319|p339|It will not be easy for him.
p339_331|p339|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p339_325|p339|I really have to go now.
p339_133|p339|It happened again yesterday.
p339_127|p339|However, the drama was not over.
p339_084|p339|There is no change in the strategy.
p339_090|p339|In fact, he took it very well.
p339_047|p339|The jury is still out on this one.
p339_053|p339|I needed to get away.
p339_286|p339|I made a mistake.
p339_292|p339|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339_279|p339|That has been lost.
p339_245|p339|It is very enjoyable.
p339_251|p339|Police are appealing for witnesses.
p339_236|p339|I'll take it as it comes.
p339_222|p339|We will all suffer as a result.
p339_008|p339|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p339_034|p339|I want somebody with something to prove.
p339_020|p339|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339_168|p339|I would like to make an impact, of course.
p339_140|p339|My ambition is to make the cut.
p339_154|p339|The hearing is expected to continue today.
p339_183|p339|Did they give any good advice?
p339_197|p339|We are going to have a party.
p339_418|p339|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p339_342|p339|That's why he is the prime minister.
p339_424|p339|Which, in effect, it is.
p339_356|p339|Could it be?
p339_381|p339|He was at the outset of his career.
p339_395|p339|You can feel the tension in the air.
p339_394|p339|There is no other option.
p339_380|p339|We have chosen for the patients.
p339_357|p339|We're talking to the US.
p339_343|p339|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
p339_419|p339|We should have been rewarded for producing.
p339_196|p339|It was a very strong metaphor.
p339_182|p339|You'll find out on Saturday.
p339_155|p339|It is just a matter of time.
p339_141|p339|It will be for the committee to decide.
p339_169|p339|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p339_021|p339|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p339_035|p339|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p339_009|p339|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p339_223|p339|Without doubt, they can win the title.
p339_237|p339|I think we're the better side.
p339_209|p339|Everything in the symphony is there.
p339_221|p339|You cannot do that in a lobby.
p339_235|p339|The answer is obviously no.
p339_023|p339|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p339_037|p339|I don't think the action was a mistake.
p339_157|p339|I'm not fit for anything else.
p339_143|p339|Rangers must be winners, it says.
p339_194|p339|This will have to change.
p339_180|p339|A film is different from a book.
p339_369|p339|The night is young.
p339_355|p339|I thought to myself.
p339_341|p339|Let's not make that mistake again.
p339_396|p339|It is a technique.
p339_382|p339|Our position is quite clear.
p339_383|p339|It could now be up to the courts.
p339_397|p339|Is it the shape of things to come?
p339_340|p339|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339_354|p339|This is a really serious issue.
p339_368|p339|He is doing just that.
p339_181|p339|Within three days he was dead.
p339_195|p339|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p339_142|p339|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p339_156|p339|This news is really depressing.
p339_036|p339|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339_022|p339|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p339_234|p339|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339_220|p339|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p339_208|p339|It is not as simple as that.
p339_224|p339|What's it about?
p339_230|p339|It has to be put in context.
p339_218|p339|We shall be victorious.
p339_026|p339|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339_032|p339|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p339_152|p339|It was an amazing time.
p339_146|p339|But it does not matter.
p339_191|p339|Which is worse?
p339_185|p339|From day one, we were a family.
p339_350|p339|I thought their commitment was superb.
p339_344|p339|They have to be dealt with.
p339_422|p339|There is no shortage of questions.
p339_378|p339|They still have a great sense of humour.
p339_393|p339|It is good football in Scotland.
p339_387|p339|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p339_386|p339|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339_392|p339|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
p339_379|p339|It decided to blame the media.
p339_345|p339|His manager blamed the referee.
p339_423|p339|Couldn't see the point.
p339_351|p339|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339_184|p339|We know that from recent experience.
p339_190|p339|They have the players to do it.
p339_147|p339|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339_153|p339|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p339_033|p339|It really has not been their season.
p339_027|p339|Glasgow is far from overload.
p339_219|p339|The quality of work is very impressive.
p339_231|p339|I think we can get there.
p339_225|p339|We are looking to the future.
p339_233|p339|No, they have played well.
p339_227|p339|I called it right.
p339_031|p339|It's about the balance.
p339_025|p339|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p339_019|p339|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p339_145|p339|I certainly think it should be there.
p339_151|p339|We were extremely lucky.
p339_179|p339|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p339_186|p339|It separates the men from the boys.
p339_192|p339|He has made a step forward.
p339_421|p339|He did very well, but didn't win.
p339_347|p339|I don't want to go anywhere.
p339_353|p339|I had nothing to lose.
p339_409|p339|What would you ask?
p339_384|p339|We can make a difference.
p339_390|p339|He has run a hell of a race.
p339_391|p339|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339_385|p339|This was not a contest.
p339_408|p339|Everyone can have their opinion.
p339_352|p339|My mind is the most important thing now.
p339_420|p339|I am also delighted for all the players.
p339_346|p339|So what was he really doing?
p339_193|p339|That was very important.
p339_187|p339|This could be wonderful.
p339_178|p339|The funding is now there.
p339_150|p339|Mind you, all was not lost.
p339_144|p339|He was part of the family.
p339_018|p339|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339_024|p339|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p339_030|p339|It was really good in the first week.
p339_226|p339|The signs are positive.
p339_232|p339|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p339_217|p339|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p339_203|p339|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
p339_029|p339|What is a house without it?
p339_015|p339|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339_001|p339|Please call Stella.
p339_149|p339|It was so sad.
p339_161|p339|What were they told?
p339_175|p339|This was much worse.
p339_363|p339|There are many questions to be answered.
p339_405|p339|We await a decision.
p339_411|p339|Where do we spend it?
p339_377|p339|This is a completely new experience for me.
p339_388|p339|I cannot describe it.
p339_389|p339|It is not designed to kill.
p339_410|p339|We have got to deal with it.
p339_376|p339|They want it to work.
p339_362|p339|I cannot really commit.
p339_404|p339|I'm delighted with our performance.
p339_174|p339|I'm so worried about the roads.
p339_160|p339|He would have done the same to me.
p339_148|p339|Sadly, he has a point.
p339_014|p339|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339_028|p339|It's a big mystery.
p339_202|p339|Lester was like that.
p339_216|p339|They know the language.
p339_228|p339|I see it as my job.
p339_200|p339|I'm very happy that it exploded.
p339_214|p339|We're not getting involved.
p339_002|p339|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339_016|p339|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339_176|p339|This was certainly not about money.
p339_162|p339|More cases are expected.
p339_189|p339|The other was a football match.
p339_348|p339|How do we get a bigger stage?
p339_374|p339|It shows the Government is listening.
p339_412|p339|I don't know how she does it.
p339_406|p339|It's a matter of balance.
p339_360|p339|You have to keep the focus alive.
p339_407|p339|It is an investment in our product.
p339_361|p339|It could have been a ceilidh.
p339_375|p339|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p339_413|p339|I saw it later in the news.
p339_349|p339|We're very close to being a good team.
p339_188|p339|He loved it, and so did they.
p339_163|p339|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p339_177|p339|It is simple, but profound.
p339_017|p339|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339_003|p339|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
p339_215|p339|The lottery has helped.
p339_201|p339|We're all paying for it.
p339_229|p339|I have always believed in myself.
p339_205|p339|We were never told it was already decided.
p339_211|p339|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p339_239|p339|There are two mysteries.
p339_007|p339|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p339_013|p339|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339_173|p339|I was very influenced by him.
p339_167|p339|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
p339_198|p339|I have no problem with that.
p339_417|p339|They are looking for partners.
p339_371|p339|I thought it was a great game.
p339_365|p339|This is a new beginning.
p339_403|p339|She was so supportive.
p339_359|p339|It looks as though there is no chance.
p339_358|p339|Thereafter they were again in control.
p339_364|p339|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
p339_402|p339|The first appeared to be successful.
p339_416|p339|We haven't come out of this very well.
p339_370|p339|But there are signs of a revival.
p339_199|p339|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p339_166|p339|My condition is not bad.
p339_172|p339|It all depends on the wind.
p339_012|p339|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339_006|p339|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p339_238|p339|We act because we must.
p339_210|p339|Find them somebody they deserve.
p339_204|p339|That's a matter for them.
p339_212|p339|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p339_206|p339|It is part of our heritage.
p339_010|p339|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p339_004|p339|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339_038|p339|You go in there and do it.
p339_164|p339|It would be very dangerous.
p339_170|p339|The goal is clear.
p339_158|p339|The day may come, but not for a while.
p339_400|p339|It's not just going to be busy.
p339_366|p339|There are moments of honesty, too.
p339_372|p339|Just get on with it.
p339_414|p339|Now we must look to the future.
p339_399|p339|It is about more than Scotland.
p339_398|p339|My body is exhausted.
p339_373|p339|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339_415|p339|I didn't play badly.
p339_401|p339|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p339_367|p339|They will fight for everything.
p339_159|p339|The enemy was time.
p339_171|p339|Just think about the lines.
p339_165|p339|How can they say that?
p339_039|p339|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
p339_005|p339|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p339_011|p339|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p339_207|p339|It is not a road of life.
p339_213|p339|It has certainly paid off for him.
p339_248|p339|But that is for another day.
p339_274|p339|However, it is going to happen.
p339_260|p339|It was an amazing experience.
p339_076|p339|A review is under way.
p339_062|p339|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_089|p339|She had to learn a new discipline.
p339_102|p339|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p339_116|p339|I feel strongly about it.
p339_328|p339|Words are not enough.
p339_300|p339|Who was on the panel?
p339_314|p339|They were following his orders.
p339_315|p339|That is an entirely different discipline.
p339_301|p339|It turned out to have been three hours.
p339_329|p339|He is in charge on the pitch.
p339_117|p339|There are exciting days ahead.
p339_103|p339|We should not be surprised at that.
p339_088|p339|We spoke about a few people.
p339_063|p339|I am not retaining him.
p339_077|p339|That should be fun.
p339_261|p339|Nobody has been put on trial.
p339_275|p339|This time it really could happen.
p339_249|p339|There is a great carry over value.
p339_263|p339|The police are hopeless.
p339_277|p339|That includes the equipment?
p339_288|p339|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p339_049|p339|I don't think that he won't be released.
p339_061|p339|A government is a government is a government.
p339_075|p339|But there was no time for that.
p339_129|p339|I don't think the referees are against us.
p339_115|p339|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p339_101|p339|Six men will take the decision.
p339_317|p339|Yet there is hope.
p339_303|p339|That is not good for golf!
p339_302|p339|That is exactly right.
p339_316|p339|It was an insult.
p339_100|p339|He is a one-off.
p339_114|p339|We're not that bad.
p339_128|p339|But it was not just the land.
p339_074|p339|It is surprising to come back this way.
p339_060|p339|But what did it matter?
p339_048|p339|We have to work together.
p339_289|p339|I think we could do well in Europe.
p339_276|p339|That sort of thing is long gone.
p339_262|p339|He will go on the bench.
p339_266|p339|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339_272|p339|It was a classic.
p339_299|p339|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p339_064|p339|The police are not the target.
p339_070|p339|It has only been rumours.
p339_058|p339|We need to do that every week.
p339_110|p339|But it was only a matter of time.
p339_104|p339|It was a disaster.
p339_138|p339|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p339_312|p339|He did not report it.
p339_306|p339|But it did not last.
p339_307|p339|They need to look after themselves.
p339_313|p339|No-one can take it in.
p339_139|p339|How can they tell?
p339_105|p339|We have been so lucky.
p339_111|p339|I always liked to get a laugh.
p339_059|p339|It gives us something to work on.
p339_071|p339|It is extremely fortunate.
p339_065|p339|It has affected it, obviously.
p339_298|p339|I have no worry about that.
p339_273|p339|This week is a perfect example.
p339_267|p339|That's the important thing.
p339_271|p339|It was my whole life.
p339_265|p339|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339_259|p339|The memory is there.
p339_073|p339|Several others were absent.
p339_067|p339|And he's not a bigot.
p339_098|p339|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339_107|p339|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p339_113|p339|Sometimes they come off.
p339_305|p339|We know the goals will come.
p339_311|p339|The first time it was rejected.
p339_339|p339|It's a double whammy.
p339_338|p339|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339_310|p339|We have nothing to lose.
p339_304|p339|He had planned to sell it.
p339_112|p339|I still hope to go.
p339_099|p339|What you sow, you have to reap.
p339_066|p339|But that title is a mistake.
p339_072|p339|Today is the first step in that process.
p339_258|p339|There are not too many like him.
p339_264|p339|There are no plans to change this.
p339_270|p339|It is, but that's not the point.
p306_334|p306|We will be homeless.
p306_320|p306|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p306_308|p306|He is a law unto himself.
p306_240|p306|Was all this really just five months ago?
p306_254|p306|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p306_268|p306|Once they go away they won't come back.
p306_283|p306|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p306_297|p306|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p306_042|p306|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p306_056|p306|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p306_081|p306|His options are severely limited.
p306_095|p306|The mood is upbeat.
p306_094|p306|You had better believe it.
p306_080|p306|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p306_057|p306|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p306_043|p306|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p306_296|p306|After that he became more romantic.
p306_282|p306|That was merely their initial problem.
p306_269|p306|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p306_255|p306|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p306_241|p306|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p306_309|p306|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p306_321|p306|I got a yellow card.
p306_335|p306|I believe he can do a better job.
p306_123|p306|This is not understood by people outside.
p306_137|p306|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p306_121|p306|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p306_135|p306|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p306_109|p306|There are some new buildings in there.
p306_323|p306|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p306_337|p306|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p306_257|p306|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p306_243|p306|It need not be like that.
p306_294|p306|In the old days, it was easy.
p306_055|p306|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p306_041|p306|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p306_069|p306|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p306_096|p306|They told us about it the next day.
p306_082|p306|It is truly fields of miracles.
p306_083|p306|They are not an item.
p306_097|p306|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p306_068|p306|How things have changed since then.
p306_040|p306|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p306_054|p306|He was shocked by what he saw.
p306_281|p306|This is a great shame.
p306_295|p306|People will make up their own minds.
p306_242|p306|They were two different types.
p306_256|p306|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p306_336|p306|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p306_322|p306|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p306_108|p306|You either have him or you don't.
p306_134|p306|There is still much work to be done.
p306_120|p306|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p306_118|p306|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p306_124|p306|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p306_130|p306|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p306_326|p306|She is now on the back benches.
p306_332|p306|He made no big mistakes.
p306_252|p306|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p306_246|p306|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p306_291|p306|It's not even finished.
p306_285|p306|I need them to set my career.
p306_078|p306|We must move on.
p306_050|p306|Except for this, it was offside.
p306_044|p306|We like being the underdogs.
p306_093|p306|But the relief was short-lived.
p306_087|p306|We do need a new one.
p306_086|p306|I have made good progress.
p306_092|p306|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p306_045|p306|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p306_051|p306|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p306_079|p306|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p306_284|p306|We said, What do you mean?
p306_290|p306|This is a young team, you know.
p306_247|p306|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p306_253|p306|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p306_333|p306|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p306_327|p306|It may also be her last.
p306_131|p306|That group reported just before Christmas.
p306_125|p306|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p306_119|p306|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p306_133|p306|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p306_127|p306|I went straight to the toilet.
p306_319|p306|I tend to not look back.
p306_331|p306|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p306_325|p306|It's good to start with Judith.
p306_279|p306|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p306_245|p306|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p306_251|p306|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p306_286|p306|The law will take its course.
p306_292|p306|Everyone knew where they were.
p306_047|p306|But the law is very clear on this.
p306_053|p306|Retirement, who knows?
p306_084|p306|Why did they let him go?
p306_090|p306|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p306_091|p306|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p306_085|p306|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p306_052|p306|It's a grey area.
p306_046|p306|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p306_293|p306|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
p306_287|p306|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p306_250|p306|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p306_244|p306|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p306_278|p306|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p306_324|p306|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p306_330|p306|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p306_318|p306|Too often it is not.
p306_126|p306|There is a lack of chemistry.
p306_132|p306|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p306_155|p306|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p306_141|p306|That's because we work hard at it.
p306_169|p306|Who do these people think they are?
p306_196|p306|The FBI could become involved.
p306_182|p306|She is living proof of their expertise.
p306_357|p306|I've only met him three times.
p306_343|p306|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p306_223|p306|She didn't tell us anything new.
p306_237|p306|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p306_021|p306|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p306_035|p306|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p306_009|p306|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p306_008|p306|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p306_034|p306|Blood samples have been taken.
p306_020|p306|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p306_236|p306|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p306_222|p306|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
p306_342|p306|What kind of person is he?
p306_356|p306|No person was charged.
p306_183|p306|This one was my best chance.
p306_197|p306|We have only nine months to go.
p306_168|p306|Four policemen were wounded.
p306_154|p306|Does that put pressure on us?
p306_142|p306|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p306_156|p306|This is a foolish idea.
p306_181|p306|It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p306_195|p306|I would like Glasgow.
p306_340|p306|Well, was it?
p306_354|p306|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p306_234|p306|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p306_220|p306|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p306_208|p306|We were on top and could have won.
p306_036|p306|He said he now intends to fly today.
p306_022|p306|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p306_023|p306|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p306_037|p306|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p306_209|p306|That night was a terrible muddle.
p306_221|p306|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p306_355|p306|I didn't even have the first idea.
p306_341|p306|We won't let you down.
p306_194|p306|I am considered a teenager.
p306_180|p306|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p306_157|p306|You might even have seen him.
p306_143|p306|He's been the key to everything.
p306_147|p306|We need a new kind of theatre.
p306_153|p306|We need some confidence to get a win.
p306_184|p306|We believe a third party was involved.
p306_190|p306|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p306_345|p306|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p306_351|p306|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p306_219|p306|I might get an injury very easily.
p306_231|p306|We have tried to keep his head up.
p306_225|p306|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p306_033|p306|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p306_027|p306|This is not an amnesty.
p306_026|p306|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p306_032|p306|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p306_224|p306|There is nothing like this back home.
p306_230|p306|This is all part of being opening the door.
p306_218|p306|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p306_344|p306|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p306_191|p306|Twaddle is a case in point.
p306_185|p306|I am writing a novel.
p306_146|p306|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p306_178|p306|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
p306_144|p306|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p306_193|p306|You look at them and you understand.
p306_187|p306|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p306_346|p306|English is the language of pop music.
p306_226|p306|I found a fault and worked at it.
p306_232|p306|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p306_018|p306|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p306_024|p306|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p306_030|p306|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p306_031|p306|I don't believe you own anything.
p306_025|p306|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p306_019|p306|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p306_233|p306|He will become the sovereign.
p306_227|p306|It was a poor performance.
p306_347|p306|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p306_186|p306|A bit of match fitness is required.
p306_192|p306|These elements are in the book.
p306_145|p306|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p306_179|p306|I came home by ambulance.
p306_174|p306|It was a bit like having children.
p306_160|p306|She collapsed and died a day later.
p306_202|p306|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p306_216|p306|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p306_014|p306|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p306_028|p306|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p306_029|p306|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p306_015|p306|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p306_001|p306|Please call Stella.
p306_217|p306|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p306_203|p306|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p306_161|p306|You should be there with six different characters.
p306_175|p306|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p306_163|p306|I took a minibus into town.
p306_177|p306|It shows that we are a civilised society.
p306_188|p306|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
p306_349|p306|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p306_215|p306|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
p306_201|p306|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p306_229|p306|You can feel at home in China.
p306_017|p306|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p306_003|p306|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p306_002|p306|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p306_016|p306|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p306_228|p306|They may yet have the last laugh.
p306_214|p306|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p306_348|p306|It is a simple equation.
p306_360|p306|She looked very, very poor.
p306_189|p306|It was located on the remote control.
p306_176|p306|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p306_162|p306|Laura is an investment banker.
p306_166|p306|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p306_172|p306|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p306_199|p306|I like footballers who play well.
p306_358|p306|You see, my back has gone.
p306_238|p306|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p306_210|p306|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p306_204|p306|Donald was a man with many friends.
p306_012|p306|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p306_006|p306|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p306_007|p306|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p306_013|p306|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p306_205|p306|We played them off the pitch.
p306_211|p306|He ended up a headmaster.
p306_239|p306|It's just gotten too big.
p306_359|p306|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p306_198|p306|Both of them have looked good.
p306_173|p306|It has been recorded twice.
p306_167|p306|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p306_159|p306|They thought they had found a home.
p306_171|p306|We want to help them through it.
p306_165|p306|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p306_207|p306|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p306_213|p306|It is like being a qualifier again.
p306_039|p306|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p306_005|p306|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p306_011|p306|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p306_010|p306|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p306_004|p306|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p306_038|p306|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p306_212|p306|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p306_206|p306|It was turning that way all across Europe.
p306_164|p306|I do my job.
p306_158|p306|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p306_117|p306|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p306_103|p306|Housing is in very short supply.
p306_315|p306|A great deal has been achieved.
p306_301|p306|He was then replaced by Ross.
p306_329|p306|Three bystanders were killed.
p306_261|p306|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p306_275|p306|She is a very lucky young lady.
p306_249|p306|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p306_063|p306|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p306_077|p306|You'd think there was a match on today.
p306_088|p306|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p306_089|p306|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p306_076|p306|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p306_062|p306|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p306_248|p306|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p306_274|p306|It does not move, which is amazing.
p306_260|p306|He must have something up his sleeve.
p306_328|p306|Maybe it helps us.
p306_300|p306|We agreed to disagree.
p306_314|p306|It was just completely erased.
p306_102|p306|Where is the anthrax?
p306_116|p306|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p306_100|p306|My office is bare.
p306_128|p306|She says the royal family get on well.
p306_302|p306|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p306_316|p306|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p306_276|p306|The threat to rural areas is real.
p306_262|p306|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p306_289|p306|The fund has three elements.
p306_074|p306|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p306_060|p306|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
p306_048|p306|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p306_049|p306|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p306_061|p306|It's all too short term.
p306_075|p306|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p306_288|p306|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p306_263|p306|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p306_277|p306|Tourism continues to struggle.
p306_317|p306|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p306_303|p306|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p306_129|p306|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p306_115|p306|There is no point in pushing it.
p306_101|p306|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p306_139|p306|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p306_105|p306|People just came on their own.
p306_111|p306|I'm not a diva.
p306_307|p306|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p306_313|p306|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p306_273|p306|The board has rejected her proposals.
p306_267|p306|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p306_298|p306|My view has now completely changed.
p306_059|p306|He was taken ill in December last year.
p306_071|p306|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p306_065|p306|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p306_064|p306|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p306_070|p306|This is the way things should be handled.
p306_058|p306|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
p306_299|p306|They finished second and third.
p306_266|p306|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p306_272|p306|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p306_312|p306|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p306_306|p306|Their message was simple.
p306_110|p306|I am prepared to step down.
p306_104|p306|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p306_138|p306|We were with him the whole time.
p306_112|p306|There is great relief at this point.
p306_106|p306|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p306_338|p306|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p306_310|p306|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p306_304|p306|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
p306_258|p306|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p306_264|p306|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p306_270|p306|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p306_066|p306|He also does not get on with Christina.
p306_072|p306|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p306_099|p306|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p306_098|p306|There are a huge number of arts.
p306_073|p306|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p306_067|p306|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p306_265|p306|Holland won by five wickets.
p306_259|p306|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
p306_305|p306|People can get them if they want.
p306_311|p306|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p306_339|p306|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p306_107|p306|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p306_113|p306|Look at them after three days of rain.
p301_360|p301|I am not among its admirers.
p301_348|p301|He did not oppose the divorce.
p301_189|p301|The role was perfect for Russell.
p301_176|p301|That will be the sweetness.
p301_162|p301|I understand the medical concerns.
p301_002|p301|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p301_016|p301|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p301_200|p301|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p301_214|p301|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p301_228|p301|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p301_229|p301|It took more than two years.
p301_215|p301|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p301_201|p301|Well, what do you know?
p301_017|p301|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p301_003|p301|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p301_163|p301|This is a United Kingdom.
p301_177|p301|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p301_188|p301|I hope you miss the cut.
p301_349|p301|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p301_407|p301|My thoughts are with their families.
p301_361|p301|And that match was played in June.
p301_375|p301|He has changed my life for ever.
p301_388|p301|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p301_363|p301|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p301_405|p301|Whether this return was too soon.
p301_411|p301|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p301_377|p301|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p301_161|p301|There is no credible official announcement.
p301_175|p301|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p301_149|p301|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p301_015|p301|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p301_001|p301|Please call Stella.
p301_029|p301|But we're not the same person.
p301_217|p301|They were later discharged from hospital.
p301_203|p301|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p301_202|p301|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p301_216|p301|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p301_028|p301|The law has got to be upheld.
p301_014|p301|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p301_148|p301|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p301_174|p301|What, then, is the real thing?
p301_160|p301|Before the game we went for a pint.
p301_410|p301|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p301_376|p301|The home was now under new management.
p301_362|p301|He will address the nation this evening.
p301_404|p301|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p301_389|p301|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p301_399|p301|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p301_400|p301|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p301_366|p301|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p301_372|p301|His job was not advertised.
p301_158|p301|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p301_164|p301|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p301_170|p301|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p301_038|p301|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p301_010|p301|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p301_004|p301|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p301_212|p301|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p301_206|p301|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p301_207|p301|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p301_213|p301|I would not want to be young again.
p301_005|p301|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p301_011|p301|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p301_039|p301|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p301_171|p301|The problem arises because he does so much.
p301_165|p301|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p301_159|p301|The death toll included five children.
p301_373|p301|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p301_401|p301|I won't go back to Holland.
p301_367|p301|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p301_398|p301|What other retailer would do this?
p301_359|p301|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p301_371|p301|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p301_365|p301|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p301_403|p301|There was no cohesion.
p301_198|p301|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p301_173|p301|Our young people are leaving.
p301_167|p301|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p301_007|p301|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p301_013|p301|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p301_239|p301|These guys will not lie down.
p301_205|p301|He will emerge as a world leader.
p301_211|p301|But he just carried on anyway.
p301_210|p301|They always want to give a performance.
p301_204|p301|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p301_238|p301|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p301_012|p301|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p301_006|p301|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p301_166|p301|However, who could have predicted this result?
p301_172|p301|The answer is mayhem.
p301_199|p301|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p301_364|p301|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p301_402|p301|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p301_370|p301|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p301_358|p301|We must not go down that road.
p301_317|p301|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p301_303|p301|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p301_115|p301|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p301_101|p301|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p301_129|p301|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p301_061|p301|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p301_075|p301|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p301_049|p301|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p301_288|p301|They had been together for about three years.
p301_263|p301|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p301_277|p301|Little Voice is on general release.
p301_276|p301|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p301_262|p301|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p301_289|p301|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p301_048|p301|I try not to expect anything.
p301_074|p301|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301_060|p301|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p301_128|p301|He was just awesome.
p301_100|p301|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p301_114|p301|He took away my childhood.
p301_302|p301|Broke the birdie record.
p301_316|p301|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p301_300|p301|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p301_314|p301|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p301_328|p301|He is young but not too young.
p301_102|p301|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p301_116|p301|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p301_089|p301|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p301_076|p301|This is a mental challenge.
p301_062|p301|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p301_274|p301|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p301_260|p301|That's the sort of game you want.
p301_248|p301|This is the New Edinburgh.
p301_249|p301|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p301_261|p301|We're not travel agents.
p301_275|p301|I'd say we should give it a week.
p301_063|p301|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301_077|p301|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p301_088|p301|So other options had to be explored.
p301_117|p301|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p301_103|p301|I am very sorry to be here.
p301_329|p301|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p301_315|p301|We are ready for the long haul.
p301_301|p301|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p301_339|p301|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p301_305|p301|That it is a brand name.
p301_311|p301|Both sides have to step back.
p301_107|p301|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p301_113|p301|The conversion didn't go over either.
p301_098|p301|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p301_073|p301|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p301_067|p301|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p301_259|p301|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p301_271|p301|Bombing is the easy option.
p301_265|p301|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p301_264|p301|It's the same old story.
p301_270|p301|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p301_258|p301|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p301_066|p301|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p301_072|p301|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p301_099|p301|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p301_112|p301|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p301_106|p301|I think my game is suited to grass.
p301_310|p301|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p301_304|p301|They tried to give her advice.
p301_338|p301|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p301_312|p301|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p301_306|p301|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p301_138|p301|The son has autism and other problems.
p301_110|p301|People want to see me on the screen.
p301_104|p301|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p301_058|p301|The encounter was to change his life.
p301_064|p301|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p301_070|p301|When he took over it really took off.
p301_299|p301|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p301_266|p301|It was a moment of madness.
p301_272|p301|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p301_273|p301|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p301_267|p301|I do not own the vessel in question.
p301_298|p301|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p301_071|p301|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p301_065|p301|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p301_059|p301|It's the best of both worlds.
p301_105|p301|Is your life a little too easy?
p301_111|p301|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p301_139|p301|I'm very puzzled by it.
p301_307|p301|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p301_313|p301|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p301_336|p301|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p301_322|p301|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p301_134|p301|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p301_120|p301|You do not change overnight.
p301_108|p301|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p301_083|p301|Cars are great for going long distances.
p301_097|p301|He was married with a young child.
p301_040|p301|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p301_054|p301|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p301_068|p301|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p301_281|p301|This will secure the future of our industry.
p301_295|p301|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p301_242|p301|There are nine people here now.
p301_256|p301|Wagner was never like this.
p301_257|p301|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p301_243|p301|His son is a local legend.
p301_294|p301|Do you come from Moscow?
p301_280|p301|That nation is South Africa.
p301_069|p301|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p301_055|p301|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p301_041|p301|It doesn't make them evil.
p301_096|p301|We did not even get a free kick.
p301_082|p301|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p301_109|p301|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p301_121|p301|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p301_135|p301|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p301_323|p301|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p301_337|p301|His English counterpart agreed.
p301_321|p301|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p301_335|p301|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p301_309|p301|This fact is supported by audience research.
p301_123|p301|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p301_137|p301|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p301_094|p301|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p301_080|p301|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p301_057|p301|I keep my fingers crossed.
p301_043|p301|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p301_296|p301|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p301_282|p301|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p301_255|p301|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p301_241|p301|That is nearly four people every day.
p301_269|p301|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p301_268|p301|Racism has no place in any sport.
p301_240|p301|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p301_254|p301|The final stage is paranoia.
p301_283|p301|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p301_297|p301|They are the innocent victims.
p301_042|p301|I have played really well all year.
p301_056|p301|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p301_081|p301|He came in an army uniform.
p301_095|p301|I have no plans to change the oath.
p301_136|p301|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p301_122|p301|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p301_308|p301|They will have to make changes.
p301_334|p301|There is no answer to it.
p301_320|p301|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p301_318|p301|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p301_324|p301|A friendship that will endure.
p301_330|p301|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p301_126|p301|Tony Blair should get out more.
p301_132|p301|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p301_091|p301|People love to see this stuff.
p301_085|p301|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p301_052|p301|She is now planning a visit.
p301_046|p301|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p301_293|p301|We just want to get stuck in now.
p301_287|p301|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p301_278|p301|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p301_250|p301|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p301_244|p301|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p301_245|p301|Which perhaps is just as well.
p301_251|p301|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p301_279|p301|There is no substitute.
p301_286|p301|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p301_292|p301|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p301_047|p301|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p301_053|p301|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p301_084|p301|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p301_090|p301|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p301_133|p301|Both were later released after a check-up.
p301_127|p301|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p301_331|p301|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p301_325|p301|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p301_319|p301|EMI is a prime example.
p301_333|p301|They've been at it for five hours.
p301_327|p301|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p301_119|p301|It is not great art.
p301_131|p301|She died in hospital two hours later.
p301_125|p301|We aim to put them out of business.
p301_086|p301|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p301_092|p301|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p301_079|p301|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p301_045|p301|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p301_051|p301|It was, however, the wrong side.
p301_284|p301|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p301_290|p301|Everything has been destroyed.
p301_247|p301|He would just say it was terrible.
p301_253|p301|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p301_252|p301|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p301_246|p301|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p301_291|p301|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p301_285|p301|It was an empowering journey.
p301_050|p301|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p301_044|p301|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p301_078|p301|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p301_093|p301|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p301_087|p301|It has never been worthwhile.
p301_124|p301|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p301_130|p301|We need to move forward together.
p301_118|p301|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p301_326|p301|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p301_332|p301|I am not obsessed with sex.
p301_396|p301|It was early morning.
p301_382|p301|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p301_355|p301|That only came out during a radio interview.
p301_341|p301|I am not putting myself down.
p301_369|p301|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p301_194|p301|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p301_180|p301|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p301_157|p301|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p301_143|p301|All things are possible if you believe.
p301_023|p301|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p301_037|p301|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p301_221|p301|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p301_235|p301|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p301_209|p301|The prognosis is excellent.
p301_208|p301|We have no choice but to shut down.
p301_234|p301|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p301_220|p301|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p301_036|p301|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p301_022|p301|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p301_142|p301|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p301_156|p301|But you can't have it both ways.
p301_181|p301|This does not create any precedent.
p301_195|p301|Harold is a rarity.
p301_368|p301|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p301_340|p301|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p301_354|p301|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p301_383|p301|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p301_397|p301|Partition is not an option.
p301_381|p301|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p301_395|p301|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p301_342|p301|He's a joy to follow.
p301_356|p301|We are now setting about finding them.
p301_183|p301|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p301_197|p301|I want him to take on Gomez.
p301_140|p301|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p301_154|p301|It is good for their eyesight.
p301_168|p301|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p301_034|p301|I kept my side of the bargain.
p301_020|p301|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p301_008|p301|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p301_236|p301|I came up through the ranks.
p301_222|p301|This makes no sense!
p301_223|p301|I go home only once.
p301_237|p301|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p301_009|p301|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p301_021|p301|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p301_035|p301|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p301_169|p301|They were behind the wheel.
p301_155|p301|I was loving that little girl.
p301_141|p301|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p301_196|p301|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p301_182|p301|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p301_357|p301|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p301_343|p301|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p301_394|p301|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p301_380|p301|It was a job he loved.
p301_384|p301|It looks like paradise.
p301_390|p301|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p301_409|p301|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p301_347|p301|I just want to change my life.
p301_353|p301|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p301_186|p301|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p301_192|p301|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p301_179|p301|There was a fossil on screen.
p301_145|p301|It is patently true.
p301_151|p301|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p301_019|p301|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p301_031|p301|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p301_025|p301|But it was a great decision he joked.
p301_233|p301|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p301_227|p301|The team this year is going places.
p301_226|p301|If not, a deal could take many months.
p301_232|p301|That's the key issue isn't it?
p301_024|p301|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p301_030|p301|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p301_018|p301|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p301_150|p301|But it looks good for next year.
p301_144|p301|This was not just incongruous.
p301_178|p301|The big issue for us is the review.
p301_193|p301|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p301_187|p301|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p301_352|p301|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p301_346|p301|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p301_408|p301|I saw some good things.
p301_391|p301|I had no qualms about it.
p301_385|p301|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p301_393|p301|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p301_387|p301|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p301_378|p301|There is no openness.
p301_350|p301|And Michael was just great.
p301_344|p301|We were lucky to have survived.
p301_191|p301|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p301_185|p301|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p301_152|p301|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p301_146|p301|You hope he prevails.
p301_026|p301|They changed the world of music.
p301_032|p301|The punishment was swift.
p301_218|p301|These findings would be made public.
p301_224|p301|It had a gigantic effect.
p301_230|p301|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p301_231|p301|He said because people had invited him.
p301_225|p301|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p301_219|p301|What are you not good at?
p301_033|p301|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p301_027|p301|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p301_147|p301|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p301_153|p301|He was forced to quit.
p301_184|p301|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p301_190|p301|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p301_345|p301|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p301_351|p301|He knew it would cost him millions.
p301_379|p301|It's being very carefully looked at.
p301_386|p301|We were short of athletes.
p301_392|p301|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p287_128|p287|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p287_302|p287|It has to be an event.
p287_316|p287|The City welcomed the numbers.
p287_276|p287|Is it in the right place?
p287_262|p287|They are very keen to work with us.
p287_289|p287|She failed in her action.
p287_074|p287|We did it for the jersey.
p287_060|p287|Do I have a favourite?
p287_048|p287|The teacher would have approved.
p287_049|p287|It is quite a figure.
p287_061|p287|What do we do?
p287_075|p287|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p287_288|p287|It was never a free kick.
p287_263|p287|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p287_277|p287|Did he trip?
p287_317|p287|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p287_303|p287|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p287_129|p287|We had to add value.
p287_115|p287|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p287_101|p287|New Year will be very busy.
p287_117|p287|They made such decisions in London.
p287_103|p287|That was the first step.
p287_315|p287|I was brought up in a mining background.
p287_301|p287|That is the general feeling.
p287_329|p287|The show is at an end.
p287_261|p287|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p287_275|p287|Do I think about them often?
p287_249|p287|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p287_063|p287|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p287_077|p287|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p287_088|p287|But I know the course.
p287_089|p287|We intend to change the model.
p287_076|p287|By then, he was walking on water.
p287_062|p287|It has been an amazing day.
p287_248|p287|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p287_274|p287|What was the matter for concern?
p287_260|p287|We run within the law.
p287_328|p287|It wasn't a good day for us.
p287_300|p287|Either team will be hard.
p287_314|p287|McNaughton was not so sure.
p287_102|p287|There's still plenty time left.
p287_116|p287|We did what we had to do.
p287_112|p287|Then again, we could have.
p287_106|p287|Mr Blair should be warned.
p287_338|p287|We are a peaceful people.
p287_310|p287|You are a different people.
p287_304|p287|We can work all night.
p287_258|p287|We are in a war.
p287_264|p287|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p287_270|p287|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p287_066|p287|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p287_072|p287|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p287_099|p287|He will go on the bench.
p287_098|p287|We have got a race.
p287_073|p287|I first met him last summer.
p287_067|p287|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p287_271|p287|This is a question of Islam.
p287_265|p287|They must play for each other.
p287_259|p287|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p287_305|p287|The answer is with ourselves.
p287_311|p287|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p287_339|p287|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p287_107|p287|Why do it otherwise?
p287_113|p287|There were no grounds for his action.
p287_139|p287|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p287_105|p287|Such actions are rarely popular.
p287_111|p287|And does it?
p287_307|p287|There is no evidence for that.
p287_313|p287|They are not left wing.
p287_273|p287|was everything done to save people?
p287_267|p287|There's not much money in cycling.
p287_298|p287|But it is up again.
p287_059|p287|So is that it, then?
p287_071|p287|It looks like a hit.
p287_065|p287|This is a big step up.
p287_064|p287|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p287_070|p287|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p287_058|p287|How are you, sir?
p287_299|p287|The rescue package is public money.
p287_266|p287|It is also very valuable.
p287_272|p287|And they were being paid?
p287_312|p287|This will secure the future of our industry.
p287_306|p287|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
p287_110|p287|So what is the campaign about?
p287_104|p287|I was impressed with them.
p287_138|p287|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p287_163|p287|Tomorrow is a new day.
p287_177|p287|People like to talk about these things.
p287_188|p287|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p287_407|p287|I decided to take my time.
p287_361|p287|They were the acts of men.
p287_375|p287|SE is well down that road.
p287_413|p287|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p287_349|p287|It is a strong case.
p287_215|p287|His second was a beauty.
p287_201|p287|Getting this right is essential.
p287_229|p287|She died in middle age.
p287_017|p287|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p287_003|p287|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p287_002|p287|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p287_016|p287|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p287_228|p287|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p287_200|p287|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p287_214|p287|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p287_348|p287|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p287_374|p287|They should take their mobile phones.
p287_412|p287|They are looking for profit.
p287_406|p287|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p287_360|p287|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p287_189|p287|Last night was a key episode.
p287_176|p287|He is believed to live in Britain.
p287_162|p287|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p287_174|p287|They bought the property four years ago.
p287_160|p287|Phase one was a shambles.
p287_148|p287|I am a good player.
p287_410|p287|That is the ultimate revenge.
p287_376|p287|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
p287_362|p287|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p287_404|p287|No, because it was too many.
p287_389|p287|It gets into the culture.
p287_202|p287|Does the name matter?
p287_216|p287|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p287_014|p287|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p287_028|p287|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p287_029|p287|He has the courage of the unaware.
p287_015|p287|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p287_001|p287|Please call Stella.  
p287_217|p287|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p287_203|p287|how do you get it back?
p287_388|p287|My dad is all right.
p287_363|p287|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p287_405|p287|It's too close to call.
p287_411|p287|It certainly appeared that way.
p287_377|p287|There is a cup final at stake.
p287_149|p287|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
p287_161|p287|The hotel was now for sale.
p287_175|p287|They need to look after themselves.
p287_159|p287|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p287_171|p287|Says the Duke of York.
p287_165|p287|Are you going to win?
p287_373|p287|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p287_415|p287|I am astonished at attack.
p287_401|p287|Does it matter?
p287_367|p287|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p287_398|p287|Had this been common practice?
p287_207|p287|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p287_213|p287|His third goal was superb.
p287_039|p287|But it might have done.
p287_005|p287|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p287_011|p287|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p287_010|p287|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p287_004|p287|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p287_038|p287|Among them are many criminals.
p287_212|p287|It had all been arranged.
p287_206|p287|Who was she?
p287_399|p287|What do they want us to do?
p287_400|p287|Is it worth it?
p287_366|p287|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p287_372|p287|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p287_414|p287|YOU thought it was a headache.
p287_164|p287|What happened in that game?
p287_170|p287|I am not ready to walk away.
p287_158|p287|This much I can tell you.
p287_166|p287|Was it the wife?
p287_172|p287|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p287_199|p287|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p287_358|p287|Even the one she loved.
p287_364|p287|Three years ago he would have been.
p287_402|p287|Motion described it as a unique event.
p287_416|p287|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p287_370|p287|The members have voted against it.
p287_238|p287|My future is in the marathon.
p287_210|p287|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p287_204|p287|What are you not good at?
p287_012|p287|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p287_006|p287|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p287_007|p287|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p287_013|p287|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p287_205|p287|I think, therefore I am?
p287_211|p287|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p287_239|p287|The effects are not all bad.
p287_417|p287|There is a solution, she believes.
p287_371|p287|We knew he was very creative.
p287_365|p287|He did a good job.
p287_403|p287|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p287_359|p287|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p287_198|p287|However, it is not as simple as this.
p287_173|p287|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p287_167|p287|Why change it?
p287_142|p287|It would seem a natural progression.
p287_156|p287|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p287_181|p287|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p287_195|p287|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p287_340|p287|You may have a short memory.
p287_354|p287|He was then replaced by Ross.
p287_368|p287|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p287_383|p287|They will fight for everything.
p287_397|p287|Safety was also an issue.
p287_234|p287|They need to win a trophy.
p287_220|p287|The red card was okay.
p287_208|p287|From there, they can go anywhere.
p287_036|p287|This represents a tough game for us.
p287_022|p287|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p287_023|p287|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p287_037|p287|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p287_209|p287|I had relied on him.
p287_221|p287|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p287_235|p287|I was ready for this.
p287_396|p287|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p287_382|p287|This remains the party's policy.
p287_369|p287|It is a stroke of genius.
p287_355|p287|I'd like to take the plunge.
p287_341|p287|The problems began a long time ago.
p287_194|p287|They might be surprised by the response.
p287_180|p287|We've had great things in the past.
p287_157|p287|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p287_143|p287|We will turn the corner.
p287_155|p287|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p287_141|p287|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p287_169|p287|His son is a local legend.
p287_196|p287|This will be our new beginning.
p287_182|p287|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p287_357|p287|I have a moral dilemma.
p287_343|p287|In the old days, it was easy.
p287_419|p287|It was important to win the singles.
p287_394|p287|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p287_380|p287|There is no deal as yet.
p287_223|p287|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p287_237|p287|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p287_021|p287|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p287_035|p287|That period was a struggle.
p287_009|p287|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p287_008|p287|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p287_034|p287|President Bush is at war.
p287_020|p287|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p287_236|p287|I am still waiting for a reply.
p287_222|p287|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p287_381|p287|It's as wide as a church in here.
p287_395|p287|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p287_418|p287|Potions said he would drive.
p287_342|p287|A Home Office spokesman said.
p287_424|p287|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p287_356|p287|Appointments should be made on merit.
p287_183|p287|You know the sort of thing.
p287_197|p287|The service from the other players was super.
p287_168|p287|What do we want to do that for?
p287_140|p287|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p287_154|p287|The people are the hero.
p287_178|p287|Being investor ready is a good start.
p287_150|p287|We have a budget in March.
p287_144|p287|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p287_193|p287|I was inspired by two things.
p287_187|p287|It caused a lot of upset.
p287_408|p287|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p287_352|p287|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p287_420|p287|I'm pleased about one thing.
p287_346|p287|Other people had looked at it.
p287_391|p287|But we are very near.
p287_385|p287|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p287_226|p287|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p287_232|p287|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
p287_018|p287|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p287_024|p287|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p287_030|p287|Life was like a timetable.
p287_031|p287|This is a central issue.
p287_025|p287|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p287_019|p287|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p287_233|p287|This is a family club.
p287_227|p287|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p287_384|p287|The pair are very much in love.
p287_390|p287|There was a substantial explosion.
p287_421|p287|That's been all around Europe with me.
p287_347|p287|They are now out in the cold.
p287_353|p287|It's wonderful to have won.
p287_409|p287|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p287_186|p287|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p287_192|p287|I can't play the game for them.
p287_145|p287|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p287_151|p287|The pension levels will remain the same.
p287_179|p287|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p287_147|p287|These days are long gone.
p287_153|p287|They could not match it.
p287_184|p287|They were seriously after him.
p287_190|p287|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p287_379|p287|I do not like to lose.
p287_345|p287|The airport was even different.
p287_423|p287|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p287_351|p287|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p287_386|p287|It was like a vacuum.
p287_392|p287|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p287_219|p287|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p287_231|p287|We were a load of rubbish.
p287_225|p287|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p287_033|p287|I thought it was an accident.
p287_027|p287|Meetings will also remain private.
p287_026|p287|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p287_032|p287|But a solution has been found.
p287_224|p287|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p287_230|p287|And thought we would get away with it.
p287_218|p287|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p287_393|p287|It has only been rumours.
p287_387|p287|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p287_350|p287|My view has now completely changed.
p287_344|p287|I think it's about time.
p287_422|p287|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p287_378|p287|It's only a matter of scale.
p287_191|p287|It is hard to tell.
p287_185|p287|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p287_152|p287|You had to go and see him.
p287_146|p287|The strong pound also took its toll.
p287_121|p287|My conscience is not clear.
p287_135|p287|We will provide immediate access.
p287_109|p287|So, did she meet him?
p287_323|p287|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p287_337|p287|My whole life has changed.
p287_257|p287|The concerns are the same.
p287_243|p287|She took them for a term.
p287_294|p287|If not, he should go home.
p287_280|p287|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p287_055|p287|You do not change overnight.
p287_041|p287|This will get their attention.
p287_069|p287|That would be too easy.
p287_096|p287|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p287_082|p287|He added that he felt undermined.
p287_083|p287|It was not an insult.
p287_097|p287|It's not a lack of confidence.
p287_068|p287|Now the plot is perfect.
p287_040|p287|There is no reason at all.
p287_054|p287|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p287_281|p287|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p287_295|p287|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p287_242|p287|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p287_256|p287|He was on a horse.
p287_336|p287|It was an achievement all right.
p287_322|p287|It is a court case.
p287_108|p287|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p287_134|p287|It has become a way of life.
p287_120|p287|You are a gambling man.
p287_136|p287|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
p287_122|p287|He is a great addition to our team.
p287_334|p287|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p287_320|p287|And he goes with it.
p287_308|p287|I can hardly believe it.
p287_240|p287|He would not impose a fine.
p287_254|p287|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p287_268|p287|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p287_283|p287|It was an easy decision to come here.
p287_297|p287|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p287_042|p287|Must be prepared to use it.
p287_056|p287|We will pay their bills.
p287_081|p287|I've never seen anything like it.
p287_095|p287|It would be the end of farming.
p287_094|p287|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p287_080|p287|It was a total disaster.
p287_057|p287|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p287_043|p287|He will need that machine.
p287_296|p287|Size is not the issue.
p287_282|p287|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p287_269|p287|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p287_255|p287|That you can do it.
p287_241|p287|It was a fairy tale.
p287_309|p287|Nothing has been put into action.
p287_321|p287|I have signed a contract.
p287_335|p287|So what happens next?
p287_123|p287|I felt he was excellent.
p287_137|p287|Three hours later, the man was free.
p287_133|p287|I would relish the prospect.
p287_127|p287|I miss the freedom that I had.
p287_319|p287|We have a good healthy debate.
p287_331|p287|Are they free?
p287_325|p287|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p287_279|p287|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p287_245|p287|But that's another story for another day.
p287_251|p287|I should think so, too.
p287_286|p287|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p287_292|p287|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p287_047|p287|There was no safety net.
p287_053|p287|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p287_084|p287|In each case they were a goal down.
p287_090|p287|Two of the team became ill.
p287_091|p287|No, the equipment is extra.
p287_085|p287|It was clear on Thursday.
p287_052|p287|I expect a rapid response.
p287_046|p287|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p287_293|p287|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p287_287|p287|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p287_250|p287|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p287_244|p287|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p287_278|p287|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p287_324|p287|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
p287_330|p287|What form did that take?
p287_318|p287|This is a war over our home.
p287_126|p287|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p287_132|p287|That is the real test.
p287_118|p287|She was also very brave.
p287_124|p287|We will try to find someone.
p287_130|p287|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p287_326|p287|After some discussion they did.
p287_332|p287|What are they for?
p287_252|p287|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p287_246|p287|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p287_291|p287|We have to be very, very careful.
p287_285|p287|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p287_078|p287|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p287_050|p287|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p287_044|p287|I had come back from London.
p287_093|p287|Before the game we went for a pint.
p287_087|p287|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p287_086|p287|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p287_092|p287|This decision is a farce.
p287_045|p287|I saw them last week.
p287_051|p287|It depends on the couple.
p287_079|p287|That was a great performance by the team.
p287_284|p287|And Michael was just great.
p287_290|p287|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p287_247|p287|Persuaded to change his mind.
p287_253|p287|No production contract is yet in sight.
p287_333|p287|Is there a waiting list?
p287_327|p287|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p287_131|p287|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p287_125|p287|The money needs to go to the front line.
p287_119|p287|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p273_129|p273|I'm so grateful for that.
p273_303|p273|His appeal is instantly understood.
p273_317|p273|You are talking about a matter of life and death.
p273_277|p273|It was never a free kick.
p273_263|p273|Her body has never been found.
p273_288|p273|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p273_075|p273|No progress has been made.
p273_061|p273|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p273_049|p273|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p273_048|p273|I must take a seat.
p273_060|p273|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p273_074|p273|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
p273_289|p273|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p273_262|p273|I'd never run for them.
p273_276|p273|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p273_316|p273|Scotland has shown the way.
p273_302|p273|Holland won by five wickets.
p273_128|p273|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
p273_114|p273|We would make a start.
p273_100|p273|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p273_116|p273|This is a frightening development.
p273_102|p273|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p273_314|p273|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p273_300|p273|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p273_328|p273|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p273_260|p273|He took over our lives.
p273_274|p273|It was an easy decision to come here.
p273_248|p273|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p273_062|p273|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p273_076|p273|He has been a success this year.
p273_089|p273|It was a family tragedy.
p273_088|p273|It was clear on Thursday.
p273_077|p273|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p273_063|p273|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p273_249|p273|We have no information on Iraq.
p273_275|p273|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p273_261|p273|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p273_329|p273|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p273_301|p273|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p273_103|p273|We deserve a significant rise.
p273_117|p273|Which can happen any time.
p273_113|p273|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p273_107|p273|There's still plenty of time left.
p273_339|p273|It's wonderful to have won.
p273_311|p273|Job losses were also announced.
p273_305|p273|I can hardly believe it.
p273_259|p273|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p273_265|p273|He could see no other bidder.
p273_271|p273|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p273_067|p273|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p273_073|p273|It makes for an interesting conference.
p273_098|p273|The following are the principal provisions.
p273_099|p273|Before the game we went for a pint.
p273_072|p273|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p273_066|p273|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p273_270|p273|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p273_264|p273|This will look at consumer attitudes.
p273_258|p273|It was a minor incident.
p273_304|p273|The songs are just so good.
p273_310|p273|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p273_338|p273|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p273_106|p273|New Year will be very busy.
p273_112|p273|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p273_138|p273|It would seem a natural progression.
p273_104|p273|Got to win today, though.
p273_110|p273|I came here this week to work.
p273_306|p273|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p273_312|p273|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p273_272|p273|It was a horrible moment.
p273_266|p273|There's not much money in cycling.
p273_299|p273|The effect was almost magical.
p273_058|p273|We will pay their bills.
p273_070|p273|Even the one she loved.
p273_064|p273|I was as strong as a horse.
p273_065|p273|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p273_071|p273|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p273_059|p273|It was exactly four months away.
p273_298|p273|The rescue package is public money.
p273_267|p273|The demand is created by the supply.
p273_273|p273|Truth is the child of time.
p273_313|p273|The pound has also suffered.
p273_307|p273|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p273_111|p273|Then again, we could have.
p273_105|p273|The pressure is on them.
p273_139|p273|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p273_162|p273|It is also very valuable.
p273_176|p273|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p273_189|p273|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p273_406|p273|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p273_360|p273|Is there a waiting list?
p273_374|p273|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p273_412|p273|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p273_348|p273|Everything in golf is a balance.
p273_214|p273|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p273_200|p273|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p273_228|p273|We have not been approached.
p273_016|p273|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p273_002|p273|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p273_003|p273|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p273_017|p273|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p273_229|p273|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p273_201|p273|From there, they can go anywhere.
p273_349|p273|He can handle it without any problem.
p273_375|p273|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p273_413|p273|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p273_407|p273|But the foundations have been laid.
p273_361|p273|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p273_188|p273|They have the cash and the fire power.
p273_177|p273|Everyone can have their opinion.
p273_163|p273|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p273_175|p273|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p273_161|p273|I did not have a bet on myself.
p273_149|p273|They should stop the bombing.
p273_411|p273|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p273_377|p273|In due course the deal was done.
p273_363|p273|They should take their mobile phones.
p273_405|p273|I've had a wonderful career.
p273_388|p273|We operate as a Scottish company.
p273_203|p273|It had all been arranged.
p273_217|p273|William Hague delighted his party.
p273_015|p273|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p273_029|p273|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p273_028|p273|It is about control of our economy.
p273_014|p273|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p273_216|p273|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p273_202|p273|I'm just a regular person.
p273_389|p273|They have not done so this season so far.
p273_362|p273|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p273_404|p273|She started to put on weight.
p273_410|p273|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p273_376|p273|It was like a weekly wage.
p273_148|p273|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p273_160|p273|Phase one was a shambles.
p273_174|p273|Two years later, she was dead.
p273_158|p273|One season, they might do well.
p273_170|p273|It was a bit like having children.
p273_164|p273|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p273_428|p273|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p273_372|p273|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p273_414|p273|I would like to continue to develop.
p273_400|p273|The results will take second place.
p273_366|p273|We are really good friends.
p273_399|p273|Clark is back on top form.
p273_206|p273|It will affect their work.
p273_212|p273|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p273_038|p273|He looks like an Afghan.
p273_004|p273|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p273_010|p273|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p273_011|p273|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p273_005|p273|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p273_039|p273|Everything else is a bonus.
p273_213|p273|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p273_207|p273|I am considered a teenager.
p273_398|p273|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p273_401|p273|It was a funny game.
p273_367|p273|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p273_373|p273|There is no deal as yet.
p273_415|p273|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p273_429|p273|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p273_165|p273|Says the Duke of York.
p273_171|p273|It shows the strength of the roots.
p273_159|p273|The jury is still out.
p273_167|p273|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p273_173|p273|This youngster is so exciting!
p273_198|p273|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p273_359|p273|Are they free?
p273_365|p273|That is a crazy situation.
p273_403|p273|It is a large number.
p273_417|p273|There is a solution, she believes.
p273_371|p273|The major championships will always have a special place.
p273_239|p273|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p273_211|p273|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p273_205|p273|His third goal was superb.
p273_013|p273|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p273_007|p273|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p273_006|p273|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p273_012|p273|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p273_204|p273|The statement contained no surprises.
p273_210|p273|The transaction is not feasible.
p273_238|p273|We were well worth the win.
p273_416|p273|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p273_370|p273|The salary changes are long overdue.
p273_364|p273|They have broken that promise.
p273_402|p273|It's too close to call.
p273_358|p273|How independent is that?
p273_199|p273|His injury was completely random.
p273_172|p273|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p273_166|p273|They bought the property four years ago.
p273_143|p273|So, did she meet him?
p273_157|p273|His team management was protective.
p273_180|p273|What happened in that game?
p273_194|p273|Little is known about them.
p273_427|p273|It was a breathtaking moment.
p273_341|p273|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p273_355|p273|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p273_433|p273|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p273_369|p273|The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed.
p273_382|p273|It benefits the whole family.
p273_396|p273|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p273_235|p273|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
p273_221|p273|That was a problem for me.
p273_209|p273|There's a chance they might come down.
p273_037|p273|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p273_023|p273|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p273_022|p273|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p273_036|p273|This will save interest charges.
p273_208|p273|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p273_220|p273|I have spoken to the skipper.
p273_234|p273|The irony was not lost.
p273_397|p273|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p273_383|p273|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p273_368|p273|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p273_354|p273|He had no previous convictions.
p273_432|p273|It is not a standing army.
p273_426|p273|No date has been fixed for his return.
p273_340|p273|He was at school in Devon.
p273_195|p273|I won't make an official complaint.
p273_181|p273|Are you going to win?
p273_156|p273|I always felt they played for me.
p273_142|p273|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p273_154|p273|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p273_140|p273|Today is not a victory.
p273_168|p273|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p273_197|p273|It was worth a photograph.
p273_183|p273|Why change it?
p273_430|p273|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p273_356|p273|I was delighted to accept.
p273_342|p273|I'd like to take the plunge.
p273_424|p273|Such an attack is bizarre.
p273_418|p273|That might mean another delay.
p273_395|p273|After the match, do you?
p273_381|p273|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
p273_222|p273|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p273_236|p273|My future is in the marathon.
p273_020|p273|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p273_034|p273|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p273_008|p273|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p273_009|p273|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p273_035|p273|Among them are many criminals.
p273_021|p273|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p273_237|p273|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p273_223|p273|They would have to go to the Royal.
p273_380|p273|We will win the argument.
p273_394|p273|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p273_419|p273|That's been all around Europe with me.
p273_343|p273|I have a moral dilemma.
p273_425|p273|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p273_431|p273|They are not left wing.
p273_357|p273|Do you think we are a top nation?
p273_182|p273|Was it the wife?
p273_196|p273|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p273_169|p273|You know the sort of thing.
p273_141|p273|Why do it otherwise?
p273_155|p273|They could not match it.
p273_179|p273|I came home by ambulance.
p273_151|p273|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p273_145|p273|And does it?
p273_192|p273|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p273_186|p273|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p273_409|p273|Russell is delighted with them.
p273_353|p273|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p273_435|p273|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p273_421|p273|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p273_347|p273|We have very limited capacity.
p273_390|p273|Rugby is a hard game.
p273_384|p273|It runs until the beginning of June.
p273_227|p273|It had so much to do with the output.
p273_233|p273|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p273_019|p273|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p273_025|p273|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p273_031|p273|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p273_030|p273|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p273_024|p273|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p273_018|p273|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p273_232|p273|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p273_226|p273|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p273_385|p273|Theatre is not a museum.
p273_391|p273|Is it worth it?
p273_420|p273|She's had to suffer for the last six years.
p273_346|p273|The strong pound also took its toll.
p273_352|p273|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p273_434|p273|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p273_408|p273|There was an element of frustration.
p273_187|p273|It was a moment of madness.
p273_193|p273|It gave no further details.
p273_144|p273|So what is the campaign about?
p273_150|p273|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p273_178|p273|Because he was born in England.
p273_146|p273|Are you from the rugby?
p273_152|p273|It's never great to finish second.
p273_185|p273|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p273_191|p273|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p273_378|p273|to have products for their needs.
p273_344|p273|My view has now completely changed.
p273_422|p273|My aim is a top six finish.
p273_436|p273|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p273_350|p273|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p273_387|p273|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p273_393|p273|How do you take them away?
p273_218|p273|You could feel the heat.
p273_230|p273|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p273_224|p273|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p273_032|p273|It carries a double message.
p273_026|p273|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p273_027|p273|Because we do not need it.
p273_033|p273|That is the face of fear.
p273_225|p273|He is obviously very dangerous.
p273_231|p273|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p273_219|p273|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p273_392|p273|Does it matter?
p273_386|p273|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p273_351|p273|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p273_345|p273|There was a definite prejudice.
p273_423|p273|That means that nobody can do it.
p273_379|p273|The pair are very much in love.
p273_190|p273|The early physical reports were clear.
p273_184|p273|What do we want to do that for?
p273_153|p273|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
p273_147|p273|Had I heard?
p273_120|p273|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p273_134|p273|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p273_108|p273|I didn't think so either.
p273_322|p273|But it is a slow process.
p273_336|p273|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p273_256|p273|We accept the new rules.
p273_242|p273|You can feel at home in China.
p273_295|p273|What was the matter for concern?
p273_281|p273|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p273_054|p273|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p273_040|p273|People want to see me on the screen.
p273_068|p273|The creditors have lost a lot.
p273_097|p273|But the battle has only just begun.
p273_083|p273|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p273_082|p273|Potions said he would drive.
p273_096|p273|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p273_069|p273|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p273_041|p273|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p273_055|p273|Let's hope that it does.
p273_280|p273|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p273_294|p273|was everything done to save the people?
p273_243|p273|Does the name matter?
p273_257|p273|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p273_337|p273|Whether this return was too soon.
p273_323|p273|The woman is basically off her head.
p273_109|p273|He thought she was amazing.
p273_135|p273|Behind him was his brother.
p273_121|p273|That would open the gates of hell.
p273_137|p273|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p273_123|p273|It feels like a privilege.
p273_335|p273|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p273_321|p273|We will listen to any suggestion.
p273_309|p273|I was brought up in a mining background.
p273_241|p273|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p273_255|p273|It was the climax of the thing.
p273_269|p273|Any error is severely punished.
p273_282|p273|You have to expect this type of thing.
p273_296|p273|Do I think about them often?
p273_043|p273|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p273_057|p273|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p273_080|p273|It's so hard to shift.
p273_094|p273|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p273_095|p273|We intend to change the model.
p273_081|p273|They lived for their children.
p273_056|p273|We have to keep our clients.
p273_042|p273|I was inspired by two things.
p273_297|p273|Is it in the right place?
p273_283|p273|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p273_268|p273|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p273_254|p273|No production contract is yet in sight.
p273_240|p273|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p273_308|p273|The world record is suspicious.
p273_320|p273|He will go a long way.
p273_334|p273|Nobody said it was required.
p273_122|p273|You are a gambling man.
p273_136|p273|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p273_132|p273|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p273_126|p273|We'll have to think about it.
p273_318|p273|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
p273_330|p273|They will have to cut through the roof.
p273_324|p273|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
p273_278|p273|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p273_244|p273|how do you get it back?
p273_250|p273|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p273_287|p273|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p273_293|p273|And they were being paid?
p273_046|p273|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p273_052|p273|Do I have a favourite?
p273_085|p273|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p273_091|p273|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p273_090|p273|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p273_084|p273|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p273_053|p273|What do we do?
p273_047|p273|I expect a rapid response.
p273_292|p273|Tony Blair said as little.
p273_286|p273|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p273_251|p273|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p273_245|p273|What are you not good at?
p273_279|p273|This is a great opportunity for us.
p273_325|p273|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p273_331|p273|The airport was even different.
p273_319|p273|The letters are going out today.
p273_127|p273|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p273_133|p273|The weather forecast isn't good.
p273_119|p273|My life has changed a lot.
p273_125|p273|I am totally devoted to this job.
p273_131|p273|There's always the next century.
p273_327|p273|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p273_333|p273|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p273_253|p273|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p273_247|p273|Who was she?
p273_290|p273|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p273_284|p273|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p273_079|p273|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p273_051|p273|So is that it, then?
p273_045|p273|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p273_092|p273|He was prepared for this.
p273_086|p273|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p273_087|p273|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p273_093|p273|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p273_044|p273|My fitness was very poor.
p273_050|p273|How are you, sir?
p273_078|p273|We have to offer value for money.
p273_285|p273|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p273_291|p273|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p273_246|p273|I think, therefore I am?
p273_252|p273|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p273_332|p273|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p273_326|p273|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p273_130|p273|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p273_124|p273|That is the ultimate revenge.
p273_118|p273|That is far too high.
p274_343|p274|After some discussion they did.
p274_425|p274|The projections are very positive for South Africa.
p274_431|p274|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p274_357|p274|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p274_419|p274|The second goal was superb.
p274_182|p274|Did he trip?
p274_196|p274|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p274_141|p274|But she was very human.
p274_155|p274|The danger is always there.
p274_169|p274|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p274_035|p274|This represents a tough game for us.
p274_021|p274|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p274_009|p274|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p274_237|p274|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p274_223|p274|Laura is an investment banker.
p274_222|p274|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p274_236|p274|Wilson will tell the truth.
p274_008|p274|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p274_020|p274|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p274_034|p274|Several investments have already been made.
p274_168|p274|It's not good at all.
p274_154|p274|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p274_140|p274|The BBC was a disgrace.
p274_197|p274|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p274_183|p274|They bought the property four years ago.
p274_418|p274|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p274_430|p274|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
p274_356|p274|It's wonderful to have won.
p274_342|p274|That's the way it goes.
p274_424|p274|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p274_381|p274|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p274_397|p274|It's never great to finish second.
p274_383|p274|It was like a weekly wage.
p274_354|p274|The pain is still acute.
p274_432|p274|The trial will open today.
p274_426|p274|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p274_340|p274|This is a historic occasion.
p274_368|p274|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p274_195|p274|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p274_181|p274|Is it in the right place?
p274_156|p274|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p274_142|p274|The referee faces a massive job.
p274_022|p274|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p274_036|p274|The boy is no longer with us.
p274_220|p274|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p274_234|p274|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p274_208|p274|Which isn't a bad idea.
p274_209|p274|We have an election in eight days.
p274_235|p274|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p274_221|p274|The red card was okay.
p274_037|p274|They said she was stable.
p274_023|p274|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p274_143|p274|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p274_157|p274|They should stop the bombing.
p274_180|p274|Do I think about them often?
p274_194|p274|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p274_369|p274|I got a yellow card.
p274_427|p274|Such an attack is bizarre.
p274_341|p274|Writing has diminished in value.
p274_355|p274|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p274_433|p274|There is another important factor.
p274_382|p274|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p274_396|p274|There was a substantial explosion.
p274_392|p274|He has earned the right to their respect.
p274_386|p274|The pair are very much in love.
p274_379|p274|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p274_437|p274|The Festival is prepared to help.
p274_351|p274|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p274_345|p274|Our season is not finished.
p274_423|p274|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p274_190|p274|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p274_184|p274|Miller was every bit as happy.
p274_153|p274|And sooner than we may think.
p274_147|p274|We have to speed up the process.
p274_027|p274|Drugs are a serious problem.
p274_033|p274|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p274_219|p274|People should make their own decisions.
p274_225|p274|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p274_231|p274|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p274_230|p274|The performance continues to improve.
p274_224|p274|We have not given up hope.
p274_218|p274|It was a crazy day.
p274_032|p274|Costs have got to be controlled.
p274_026|p274|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p274_146|p274|The whole industry is a shambles.
p274_152|p274|It was by the numbers.
p274_185|p274|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p274_191|p274|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p274_344|p274|No one wants a dispute.
p274_422|p274|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p274_436|p274|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p274_350|p274|Other people had looked at it.
p274_378|p274|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p274_387|p274|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p274_393|p274|The law would appear to be on our side.
p274_385|p274|It will be completed within a year.
p274_391|p274|It runs until the beginning of June.
p274_408|p274|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p274_420|p274|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
p274_346|p274|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p274_352|p274|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p274_434|p274|This is a limited market.
p274_187|p274|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p274_193|p274|We represent a wide range of society.
p274_178|p274|was everything done to save people?
p274_144|p274|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p274_150|p274|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p274_018|p274|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p274_030|p274|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p274_024|p274|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p274_232|p274|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p274_226|p274|William Hague delighted his party.
p274_227|p274|We played them off the pitch.
p274_233|p274|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p274_025|p274|I can't play the game for them.
p274_031|p274|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p274_019|p274|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p274_151|p274|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p274_145|p274|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p274_179|p274|What was the matter for concern?
p274_192|p274|I'm interested in interesting work.
p274_186|p274|They responded well after the run of defeats.
p274_353|p274|Either team will be hard.
p274_435|p274|Its failure is no surprise.
p274_421|p274|I was pleased with my own game.
p274_347|p274|The business model is actually very exciting.
p274_409|p274|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p274_390|p274|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p274_384|p274|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p274_446|p274|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p274_320|p274|Are they free?
p274_334|p274|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p274_452|p274|But we have built a platform for next season.
p274_308|p274|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p274_122|p274|He said to give a local injection.
p274_136|p274|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p274_095|p274|It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.
p274_081|p274|It took an option on the process.
p274_056|p274|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p274_042|p274|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p274_297|p274|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p274_283|p274|There's not much money in cycling.
p274_254|p274|Is our children learning?
p274_240|p274|You will have seen the adverts.
p274_268|p274|This will save interest charges.
p274_269|p274|No production contract is yet in sight.
p274_241|p274|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p274_255|p274|How independent is that?
p274_282|p274|It is also very valuable.
p274_296|p274|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p274_043|p274|He will need that machine.
p274_057|p274|He's not getting into any games.
p274_080|p274|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p274_094|p274|He is not a dancer.
p274_137|p274|It's going to take some time.
p274_123|p274|What happened in that game?
p274_309|p274|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p274_335|p274|He has left the company.
p274_453|p274|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p274_447|p274|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p274_321|p274|What are they for?
p274_451|p274|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
p274_337|p274|There will be good prospects ahead.
p274_323|p274|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p274_445|p274|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p274_135|p274|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p274_121|p274|That is far too high.
p274_109|p274|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p274_082|p274|We have to offer value for money.
p274_096|p274|In the end we made too many errors.
p274_041|p274|He looks like an Afghan.
p274_055|p274|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p274_069|p274|Do I have a favourite?
p274_280|p274|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p274_294|p274|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p274_243|p274|I was released after six days.
p274_257|p274|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p274_256|p274|What form did that take?
p274_242|p274|It will now be revived.
p274_295|p274|This is a great opportunity for us.
p274_281|p274|This will look at consumer attitudes.
p274_068|p274|So is that it, then?
p274_054|p274|There's still plenty time left.
p274_040|p274|Well, he is an artist.
p274_097|p274|The following are the principal provisions.
p274_083|p274|Our mother is very worried.
p274_108|p274|Here the jury is still out.
p274_120|p274|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p274_134|p274|This is a major championship.
p274_322|p274|Is there a waiting list?
p274_444|p274|They are interior designers and architects.
p274_450|p274|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p274_336|p274|And he goes with it.
p274_468|p274|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
p274_332|p274|But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.
p274_454|p274|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p274_440|p274|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p274_326|p274|What do they want us to do?
p274_118|p274|This should begin in October.
p274_130|p274|That would open the gates of hell.
p274_124|p274|Are you going to win?
p274_087|p274|Tony Blair said as little.
p274_093|p274|It was a family tragedy.
p274_078|p274|I first met him last summer.
p274_044|p274|People want to see me on the screen.
p274_050|p274|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p274_285|p274|None of this work is guaranteed.
p274_291|p274|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p274_246|p274|I was just a kid.
p274_252|p274|Did it work?
p274_253|p274|Do you think we are a top nation?
p274_247|p274|There were no reports of casualties.
p274_290|p274|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p274_284|p274|My main intention was to write a funny comedy.
p274_051|p274|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p274_045|p274|I had come back from London.
p274_079|p274|It is the only company of its kind in the UK.
p274_092|p274|It was clear on Thursday.
p274_086|p274|This is a complex and detailed report.
p274_125|p274|Was it the wife?
p274_131|p274|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p274_119|p274|I was on a roll.
p274_441|p274|I didn't get to keep it.
p274_327|p274|Is it worth it?
p274_333|p274|The group is not paying a dividend.
p274_455|p274|It was like someone had died.
p274_469|p274|He will not be involved in school discipline.
p274_319|p274|McNaughton was not so sure.
p274_325|p274|Had this been common practice?
p274_443|p274|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p274_457|p274|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p274_331|p274|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p274_127|p274|What do we want to do that for?
p274_133|p274|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p274_090|p274|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p274_084|p274|They lived for their children.
p274_053|p274|We felt it was sufficient.
p274_047|p274|I had trouble with the producers.
p274_292|p274|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p274_286|p274|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p274_279|p274|He took over our lives.
p274_251|p274|Does that put pressure on us?
p274_245|p274|Others agreed with this view.
p274_244|p274|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p274_250|p274|He would not impose a fine.
p274_278|p274|Quality was high in all sections.
p274_287|p274|It has raised the profile of Scottish banking.
p274_293|p274|And Michael was just great.
p274_046|p274|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p274_052|p274|The latter were not from Scotland.
p274_085|p274|It wasn't possible to relax.
p274_091|p274|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p274_132|p274|I feel very grateful with everything.
p274_126|p274|Why change it?
p274_456|p274|They offer a kind of narrative.
p274_330|p274|We're not an employment agency.
p274_324|p274|So what happens next?
p274_442|p274|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p274_318|p274|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p274_467|p274|The answer was up there on the stage.
p274_301|p274|And we were very lucky.
p274_315|p274|The songs are just so good.
p274_329|p274|I was brought up in a mining background.
p274_103|p274|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p274_117|p274|We had another last Tuesday.
p274_088|p274|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p274_077|p274|There may be reasons for it.
p274_063|p274|We need to increase the membership.
p274_275|p274|He is quite well organised.
p274_261|p274|You can feel at home in China.
p274_249|p274|The effects are not all bad.
p274_248|p274|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p274_260|p274|Labour was too busy to respond.
p274_274|p274|We accept the new rules.
p274_062|p274|It's not covered by the insurance.
p274_076|p274|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p274_089|p274|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p274_116|p274|Which can happen any time.
p274_102|p274|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p274_328|p274|There was no hint of scandal.
p274_314|p274|His appeal is instantly understood.
p274_466|p274|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p274_300|p274|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p274_470|p274|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p274_316|p274|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p274_302|p274|So the Government will be damaged.
p274_464|p274|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p274_458|p274|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p274_114|p274|It was a good game to watch.
p274_100|p274|Before the game we went for a pint.
p274_128|p274|Does the name matter?
p274_060|p274|He hadn't had them for a long time.
p274_074|p274|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p274_048|p274|Subsidy income will not be affected.
p274_289|p274|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p274_262|p274|He will go a long way.
p274_276|p274|I couldn't honestly tell you.
p274_277|p274|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p274_263|p274|We have no information on Iraq.
p274_288|p274|They can leave at any time.
p274_049|p274|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p274_075|p274|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p274_061|p274|Only water is currently allowed.
p274_129|p274|how do you get it back?
p274_101|p274|Our house was very small.
p274_115|p274|However, the problem is the timing.
p274_459|p274|Now that business is banned.
p274_303|p274|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p274_465|p274|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p274_317|p274|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p274_449|p274|It is pretty bad news.
p274_313|p274|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
p274_461|p274|The boys are mentally focused.
p274_307|p274|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p274_139|p274|It is a vicious circle.
p274_111|p274|You can spend money on housing.
p274_105|p274|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p274_059|p274|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p274_065|p274|Then followed a bout of flu.
p274_071|p274|Why do it otherwise?
p274_298|p274|You have to expect this type of thing.
p274_267|p274|I should think so, too.
p274_273|p274|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p274_272|p274|This idea has been around for four years.
p274_266|p274|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p274_299|p274|It is a flexible concept.
p274_070|p274|What do we do?
p274_064|p274|There could be a way back.
p274_058|p274|We will pay their bills.
p274_104|p274|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p274_110|p274|We have a team to reach the final.
p274_138|p274|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p274_460|p274|Let that be their memorial.
p274_306|p274|We will deliver at director level.
p274_312|p274|Everything in golf is a balance.
p274_448|p274|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p274_338|p274|It is a court case.
p274_304|p274|There's nothing I can say.
p274_462|p274|Driving has been the key.
p274_310|p274|The rescue package is public money.
p274_106|p274|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p274_112|p274|It's not a quick fix.
p274_099|p274|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p274_072|p274|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p274_066|p274|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p274_258|p274|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p274_270|p274|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p274_264|p274|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p274_271|p274|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p274_259|p274|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p274_067|p274|How are you, sir?
p274_073|p274|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p274_098|p274|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p274_113|p274|Structural changes were also required.
p274_107|p274|We deserve a significant rise.
p274_311|p274|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p274_305|p274|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p274_463|p274|It's because they can't understand the language.
p274_339|p274|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p274_389|p274|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p274_362|p274|We are in a global market.
p274_404|p274|Neither man has been charged.
p274_410|p274|I've had a wonderful career.
p274_376|p274|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p274_438|p274|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p274_160|p274|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p274_174|p274|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p274_148|p274|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p274_014|p274|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p274_028|p274|This is a central issue.
p274_216|p274|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p274_202|p274|The early physical reports were clear.
p274_203|p274|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p274_217|p274|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p274_029|p274|Not if you know the person.
p274_015|p274|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p274_149|p274|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
p274_175|p274|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p274_161|p274|He was in great spirits.
p274_439|p274|His message was very simple.
p274_411|p274|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p274_377|p274|Those people must be accountable.
p274_363|p274|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p274_405|p274|The members have voted against it.
p274_388|p274|The group will also become an Internet service provider.
p274_375|p274|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p274_413|p274|But the foundations have been laid.
p274_407|p274|Nobody will be forced to work.
p274_361|p274|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p274_349|p274|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p274_188|p274|The interim dividend has been passed.
p274_177|p274|And they were being paid?
p274_163|p274|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p274_003|p274|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p274_017|p274|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p274_201|p274|That might mean another delay.
p274_215|p274|I am considered a teenager.
p274_229|p274|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p274_228|p274|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p274_214|p274|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p274_200|p274|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p274_016|p274|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p274_002|p274|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p274_162|p274|We came across the first set of bodies.
p274_176|p274|Says the Duke of York.
p274_189|p274|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p274_348|p274|There was some merit in that.
p274_406|p274|It's too close to call.
p274_360|p274|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p274_374|p274|It had been a magical moment.
p274_412|p274|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p274_358|p274|Governments will have to respond.
p274_416|p274|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p274_370|p274|Does it matter?
p274_364|p274|Italy was just behind the US.
p274_402|p274|Clark is back on top form.
p274_199|p274|He should emerge as the winner.
p274_166|p274|They had been forced to walk.
p274_006|p274|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p274_012|p274|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. 
p274_238|p274|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p274_204|p274|The result is utterly compelling.
p274_210|p274|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p274_211|p274|They have known the hard times.
p274_205|p274|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p274_239|p274|Those overseas offices were great.
p274_013|p274|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p274_007|p274|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p274_167|p274|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p274_173|p274|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p274_198|p274|Everyone can have their opinion.
p274_365|p274|It was a unanimous decision.
p274_403|p274|We're not taking any risks.
p274_417|p274|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p274_371|p274|How do you take them away?
p274_359|p274|We have very limited capacity.
p274_398|p274|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p274_429|p274|I never had a childhood.
p274_401|p274|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p274_367|p274|He had no previous convictions.
p274_373|p274|After the match, do you?
p274_415|p274|It's just a training thing.
p274_159|p274|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p274_165|p274|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p274_171|p274|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p274_039|p274|Merger would be entirely logical.
p274_011|p274|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p274_005|p274|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p274_213|p274|It's easy to be negative about these things.
p274_207|p274|It was worth a photograph.
p274_206|p274|I won't make an official complaint.
p274_212|p274|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p274_004|p274|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p274_010|p274|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p274_038|p274|Among them are many criminals.
p274_170|p274|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p274_164|p274|But it is different in different regions.
p274_158|p274|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p274_372|p274|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p274_414|p274|That is the ultimate revenge.
p274_400|p274|It has only been rumours.
p274_366|p274|Do not forget about Monaco.
p274_428|p274|It needs to be volatile.
p274_399|p274|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p280_342|p280|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p280_356|p280|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p280_183|p280|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p280_197|p280|What was the matter for concern?
p280_140|p280|There was only one living room, you see.
p280_154|p280|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p280_168|p280|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p280_034|p280|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p280_020|p280|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p280_008|p280|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p280_236|p280|That is the last thing they need.
p280_222|p280|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p280_223|p280|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p280_237|p280|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p280_009|p280|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p280_021|p280|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p280_035|p280|It is about control of our economy.
p280_169|p280|We had to work very hard for our points.
p280_155|p280|Time may already have run out for this option.
p280_141|p280|I am not under any new pressure.
p280_196|p280|was everything done to save people?
p280_182|p280|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p280_357|p280|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p280_343|p280|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p280_394|p280|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p280_380|p280|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p280_396|p280|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p280_382|p280|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p280_355|p280|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p280_341|p280|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p280_369|p280|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p280_194|p280|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p280_180|p280|I am secure in my own position.
p280_157|p280|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p280_143|p280|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p280_023|p280|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p280_037|p280|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p280_221|p280|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p280_235|p280|You are not allowed to do that.
p280_209|p280|They are a victim of their own success.
p280_208|p280|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p280_234|p280|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p280_220|p280|I was independent but I am not now.
p280_036|p280|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p280_022|p280|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p280_142|p280|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p280_156|p280|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p280_181|p280|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p280_195|p280|And they were being paid?
p280_368|p280|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p280_340|p280|Do I have a favourite?
p280_354|p280|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p280_383|p280|I just felt that I was broken down.
p280_397|p280|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p280_393|p280|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p280_387|p280|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p280_378|p280|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p280_350|p280|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p280_344|p280|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p280_191|p280|You are not long home from work.
p280_185|p280|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p280_152|p280|Did it work?
p280_146|p280|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p280_026|p280|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p280_032|p280|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p280_218|p280|A European final must be the millennium target.
p280_224|p280|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p280_230|p280|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p280_231|p280|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p280_225|p280|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p280_219|p280|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p280_033|p280|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p280_027|p280|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p280_147|p280|You should feel involved in their lives.
p280_153|p280|Do you think we are a top nation?
p280_184|p280|We have come a long way since then.
p280_190|p280|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p280_345|p280|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p280_351|p280|I think we are back on track.
p280_379|p280|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p280_386|p280|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p280_392|p280|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p280_384|p280|What do we do?
p280_390|p280|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p280_409|p280|The play was to go straight ahead.
p280_347|p280|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p280_353|p280|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p280_186|p280|A great player has to win major championships.
p280_192|p280|I am fighting the force of nature.
p280_179|p280|Nato has left them with no other option.
p280_145|p280|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p280_151|p280|Does that put pressure on us?
p280_019|p280|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p280_031|p280|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p280_025|p280|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p280_233|p280|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p280_227|p280|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p280_226|p280|If not, a deal could take many months.
p280_232|p280|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p280_024|p280|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p280_030|p280|She brought a lot to my life.
p280_018|p280|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p280_150|p280|Did he trip?
p280_144|p280|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p280_178|p280|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p280_193|p280|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p280_187|p280|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p280_352|p280|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p280_346|p280|It was a bit like having children.
p280_408|p280|So it looks like a done deal.
p280_391|p280|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p280_385|p280|Why do it otherwise?
p280_321|p280|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p280_335|p280|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p280_309|p280|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p280_123|p280|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p280_137|p280|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p280_094|p280|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p280_080|p280|They said our costs were too high.
p280_057|p280|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p280_043|p280|He too started on the subs seats.
p280_296|p280|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p280_282|p280|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p280_255|p280|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p280_241|p280|Why change it?
p280_269|p280|They always want to give a performance.
p280_268|p280|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p280_240|p280|Was it the wife?
p280_254|p280|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p280_283|p280|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p280_297|p280|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p280_042|p280|He does not even trust his own members.
p280_056|p280|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p280_081|p280|I do not attempt to answer that.
p280_095|p280|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p280_136|p280|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p280_122|p280|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p280_308|p280|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p280_334|p280|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p280_320|p280|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p280_336|p280|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p280_322|p280|We will not simply hit these people.
p280_134|p280|There is no future in rock music.
p280_120|p280|It is the right package for Scotland.
p280_108|p280|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p280_083|p280|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p280_097|p280|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p280_040|p280|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p280_054|p280|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p280_068|p280|But it was not all bad news.
p280_281|p280|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p280_295|p280|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p280_242|p280|What do we want to do that for?
p280_256|p280|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p280_257|p280|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p280_243|p280|Does the name matter?
p280_294|p280|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p280_280|p280|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p280_069|p280|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p280_055|p280|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p280_041|p280|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p280_096|p280|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p280_082|p280|It's been a great evening for us.
p280_109|p280|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p280_121|p280|They have no real friends in the region.
p280_135|p280|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p280_323|p280|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p280_337|p280|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p280_333|p280|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p280_327|p280|I try to be open to experience.
p280_119|p280|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p280_131|p280|He's got to look after himself now.
p280_125|p280|I think there's not much between them.
p280_086|p280|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p280_092|p280|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p280_079|p280|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p280_045|p280|Does it matter?
p280_051|p280|I'm as fit as I can get.
p280_284|p280|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p280_290|p280|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p280_247|p280|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p280_253|p280|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p280_252|p280|The rise has come too late for some.
p280_246|p280|I think, therefore I am?
p280_291|p280|He would get into any world team.
p280_285|p280|There was just fire all around me.
p280_050|p280|Have I really come to this?
p280_044|p280|Is it worth it?
p280_078|p280|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p280_093|p280|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p280_087|p280|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p280_124|p280|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
p280_130|p280|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p280_118|p280|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p280_326|p280|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p280_332|p280|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p280_318|p280|I always felt they played for me.
p280_324|p280|It is not either national standards or local control.
p280_330|p280|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p280_126|p280|So I am going in the right direction.
p280_132|p280|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p280_091|p280|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p280_085|p280|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p280_052|p280|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p280_046|p280|How do you take them away?
p280_293|p280|They first met during a Step in London.
p280_287|p280|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p280_278|p280|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p280_250|p280|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p280_244|p280|how do you get it back?
p280_245|p280|What are you not good at?
p280_251|p280|However, the figures tell a different story.
p280_279|p280|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p280_286|p280|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p280_292|p280|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p280_047|p280|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p280_053|p280|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p280_084|p280|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p280_090|p280|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p280_133|p280|No country has a similar training programme.
p280_127|p280|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p280_331|p280|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p280_325|p280|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p280_319|p280|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p280_300|p280|So, did she meet him?
p280_314|p280|He felt too close to head office.
p280_328|p280|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p280_102|p280|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p280_116|p280|Had this been common practice?
p280_089|p280|I feel I did not have enough time.
p280_076|p280|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p280_062|p280|The referee is there to decide these things.
p280_274|p280|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p280_260|p280|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p280_248|p280|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p280_249|p280|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p280_261|p280|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p280_275|p280|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p280_063|p280|There were no details of the other five victims.
p280_077|p280|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p280_088|p280|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p280_117|p280|What do they want us to do?
p280_103|p280|We were under a bit of pressure.
p280_329|p280|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p280_315|p280|If you believe in the blue and white.
p280_301|p280|So what is the campaign about?
p280_317|p280|He will just go on doing his job.
p280_303|p280|Are you from the rugby?
p280_115|p280|So what happens next?
p280_101|p280|We are already seeing some positive results.
p280_129|p280|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p280_061|p280|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p280_075|p280|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p280_049|p280|Has the conflict started?
p280_288|p280|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p280_263|p280|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p280_277|p280|I think the shares are good value.
p280_276|p280|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p280_262|p280|There would be a north and south division.
p280_289|p280|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p280_048|p280|After the match, do you?
p280_074|p280|But two groups refused to sign up.
p280_060|p280|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p280_128|p280|We have to offer value for money.
p280_100|p280|I am delighted to hear this news.
p280_114|p280|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p280_302|p280|And does it?
p280_316|p280|A report on their property is due within days.
p280_312|p280|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p280_306|p280|Are you going to win?
p280_138|p280|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p280_110|p280|Some young girls also came by last night.
p280_104|p280|They won't actually make any money from it.
p280_058|p280|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p280_064|p280|It also has a good labour supply.
p280_070|p280|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p280_299|p280|He could understand both points of view.
p280_266|p280|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p280_272|p280|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p280_273|p280|I think I was about four years old.
p280_267|p280|The board do not own the company.
p280_298|p280|It is based on population rather than need.
p280_071|p280|It turned me against the whole system.
p280_065|p280|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p280_059|p280|We just want this season to end.
p280_105|p280|I bought a flat six years ago.
p280_111|p280|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p280_139|p280|The programme has been made with great care.
p280_307|p280|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
p280_313|p280|For that reason cover should not be given.
p280_339|p280|So is that it, then?
p280_305|p280|What happened in that game?
p280_311|p280|He is keen to stay in public service.
p280_107|p280|They are a different team at home.
p280_113|p280|Is there a waiting list?
p280_098|p280|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p280_073|p280|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p280_067|p280|He was failed by his health authority.
p280_259|p280|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p280_271|p280|That's been the difference between the sides.
p280_265|p280|His condition was described as serious last night.
p280_264|p280|The two companies were not for sale.
p280_270|p280|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p280_258|p280|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p280_066|p280|Do not give your details to anyone.
p280_072|p280|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p280_099|p280|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p280_112|p280|What are they for?
p280_106|p280|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p280_310|p280|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p280_304|p280|Had I heard?
p280_338|p280|How are you, sir?
p280_388|p280|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p280_363|p280|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p280_405|p280|I'd never seen a play about me.
p280_377|p280|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p280_161|p280|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p280_175|p280|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p280_149|p280|Is it in the right place?
p280_015|p280|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p280_001|p280|Please call Stella.  
p280_029|p280|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p280_217|p280|I do not see this so much as failure.
p280_203|p280|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p280_202|p280|I've never had a year like this.
p280_216|p280|I am not going to judge them.
p280_028|p280|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p280_014|p280|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p280_148|p280|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p280_174|p280|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p280_160|p280|A progress report will be published in October.
p280_410|p280|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
p280_376|p280|It used to be all hard sell.
p280_362|p280|He's young enough and he must learn.
p280_404|p280|My views on the decision are well known.
p280_389|p280|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p280_374|p280|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p280_406|p280|We were on top and could have won.
p280_360|p280|They have the cash and the fire power.
p280_348|p280|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p280_189|p280|The story was not made public by this club.
p280_176|p280|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p280_162|p280|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p280_002|p280|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p280_016|p280|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p280_200|p280|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p280_214|p280|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p280_228|p280|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p280_229|p280|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p280_215|p280|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p280_201|p280|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p280_017|p280|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p280_003|p280|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p280_163|p280|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p280_177|p280|It's just a different way of life.
p280_188|p280|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p280_349|p280|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p280_407|p280|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
p280_361|p280|The institute board will take the decision.
p280_375|p280|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p280_359|p280|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p280_371|p280|We have been going for three years.
p280_365|p280|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p280_403|p280|These old songs are very nice to play.
p280_198|p280|But they had to be paid for.
p280_173|p280|If successful, several records will be made.
p280_167|p280|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p280_007|p280|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p280_013|p280|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p280_239|p280|Jim was down there with his wife.
p280_205|p280|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p280_211|p280|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p280_210|p280|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p280_204|p280|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p280_238|p280|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p280_012|p280|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p280_006|p280|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p280_166|p280|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p280_172|p280|He said some things which were better left alone.
p280_199|p280|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p280_364|p280|Both players gave so much to the side.
p280_402|p280|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
p280_370|p280|I have come here to show support for the families.
p280_358|p280|His style was direct and very human.
p280_399|p280|I think it's a big advantage to us.
p280_400|p280|There were no hard words between us.
p280_366|p280|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p280_372|p280|He really played us into a corner.
p280_158|p280|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p280_164|p280|Surely it can't run for two years.
p280_170|p280|That is a big risk at any price.
p280_038|p280|He added that her comments were noted.
p280_010|p280|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p280_004|p280|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p280_212|p280|It is going to change the world.
p280_206|p280|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p280_207|p280|I want an answer from the British Government.
p280_213|p280|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p280_005|p280|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p280_011|p280|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p280_039|p280|She will get through it I'm sure.
p280_171|p280|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p280_165|p280|But the game is still wide open.
p280_159|p280|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p280_373|p280|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p280_401|p280|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
p280_367|p280|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p280_398|p280|People have a wish to charge twice.
p245_329|p245|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p245_315|p245|They had a confession.
p245_301|p245|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p245_249|p245|I can't get a job.
p245_261|p245|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p245_275|p245|You've got to have both sides.
p245_063|p245|He was popular.
p245_077|p245|That is bound to happen.
p245_088|p245|Then came the crunch.
p245_089|p245|If you could find it.
p245_076|p245|I'd like to continue that record.
p245_062|p245|He should have asked for a second opinion.
p245_274|p245|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p245_260|p245|It is set in Paris.
p245_248|p245|Is there on his hands?
p245_300|p245|It's just not funny!
p245_314|p245|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p245_328|p245|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p245_102|p245|I have had no social life at all.
p245_116|p245|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p245_128|p245|I was awful.
p245_100|p245|I was angry.
p245_114|p245|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p245_302|p245|And he goes with it.
p245_316|p245|I am very happy to be here.
p245_276|p245|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p245_262|p245|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p245_289|p245|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p245_048|p245|We need to chat.
p245_074|p245|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p245_060|p245|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p245_061|p245|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p245_075|p245|What has changed?
p245_049|p245|The boy is no longer with us.
p245_288|p245|The goals will come.
p245_263|p245|Immediate action must be taken.
p245_277|p245|It was a virus.
p245_317|p245|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p245_303|p245|You are the glory.
p245_115|p245|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p245_101|p245|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p245_129|p245|That group reported just before Christmas.
p245_105|p245|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p245_111|p245|I can't even get into the A team.
p245_139|p245|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p245_307|p245|He was solid.
p245_313|p245|Craig is a major concern for us.
p245_273|p245|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p245_267|p245|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p245_298|p245|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p245_071|p245|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p245_065|p245|The script was funny.
p245_059|p245|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p245_058|p245|It's a matter of balance.
p245_064|p245|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p245_070|p245|Is there a new way forward?
p245_299|p245|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p245_266|p245|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p245_272|p245|It happens from time to time.
p245_312|p245|They wanted the club to make money.
p245_306|p245|We have waited a long time for this.
p245_138|p245|Mr Blair had done well.
p245_110|p245|We work on the same level.
p245_104|p245|I'm delighted about that.
p245_112|p245|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p245_106|p245|Who would be a referee?
p245_310|p245|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
p245_304|p245|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p245_338|p245|Indeed, it was magical.
p245_264|p245|It left me with a sadness.
p245_270|p245|People have no choice.
p245_258|p245|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p245_066|p245|You need a trademark.
p245_072|p245|People must remain vigilant.
p245_099|p245|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p245_098|p245|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p245_073|p245|This is the way things should be handled.
p245_067|p245|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p245_259|p245|I HAVE a dream.
p245_271|p245|She looked so young.
p245_265|p245|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p245_339|p245|I would miss him.
p245_305|p245|We want to play at the worlds.
p245_311|p245|I never thought it would take this long.
p245_107|p245|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p245_113|p245|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p245_148|p245|That will do for me.
p245_174|p245|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p245_160|p245|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p245_202|p245|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p245_216|p245|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p245_028|p245|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p245_014|p245|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p245_015|p245|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p245_001|p245|Please call Stella.  
p245_029|p245|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p245_217|p245|I can't wait to meet him.
p245_203|p245|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p245_161|p245|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p245_175|p245|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p245_149|p245|Nobody did in those days.
p245_163|p245|We did everything by the book.
p245_177|p245|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p245_188|p245|It's all about money, money, money.
p245_349|p245|It is not like working for a living.
p245_229|p245|He was good, but not that good.
p245_215|p245|It's so special.
p245_201|p245|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p245_017|p245|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p245_003|p245|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p245_002|p245|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p245_016|p245|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p245_200|p245|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p245_214|p245|At the time, he was a living legend.
p245_228|p245|This fact is supported by audience research.
p245_348|p245|They should take their mobile phones.
p245_189|p245|That will be vital.
p245_176|p245|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p245_162|p245|They will run a mile.
p245_166|p245|I had a train to catch.
p245_172|p245|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p245_199|p245|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p245_358|p245|He's very explosive.
p245_210|p245|Saturday is gone.
p245_204|p245|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p245_238|p245|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p245_012|p245|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p245_006|p245|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p245_007|p245|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p245_013|p245|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p245_239|p245|There wasn't a goal.
p245_205|p245|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p245_211|p245|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p245_359|p245|But nothing happened.
p245_198|p245|It's been a good year.
p245_173|p245|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p245_167|p245|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p245_171|p245|People will ask about us.
p245_165|p245|What has caused the demise of singing?
p245_207|p245|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p245_213|p245|It was good fun.
p245_005|p245|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p245_011|p245|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p245_039|p245|It was clear.
p245_038|p245|It has failed.
p245_010|p245|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p245_004|p245|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p245_212|p245|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p245_206|p245|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p245_158|p245|Everyone can be bought.
p245_164|p245|It is not fair.
p245_170|p245|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p245_155|p245|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p245_141|p245|He can do no wrong.
p245_196|p245|I had decided to quit the show.
p245_182|p245|The red card was okay.
p245_357|p245|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p245_343|p245|It was forced to divert.
p245_223|p245|They should come forward.
p245_237|p245|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p245_009|p245|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p245_021|p245|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p245_035|p245|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p245_034|p245|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p245_020|p245|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p245_008|p245|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p245_236|p245|You can feel at home in China.
p245_222|p245|We were a load of rubbish.
p245_342|p245|I'm very lucky.
p245_356|p245|It's not that clear-cut.
p245_183|p245|I have a cold.
p245_197|p245|His third goal was superb.
p245_140|p245|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p245_154|p245|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p245_168|p245|It is tough, but possible.
p245_142|p245|Was this element always there?
p245_156|p245|The hotel was now for sale.
p245_181|p245|But we are not immune to the problem.
p245_195|p245|I began to pray.
p245_340|p245|There's no place to hide.
p245_354|p245|It was very formal.
p245_208|p245|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p245_234|p245|It's only fair.
p245_220|p245|They had no children.
p245_036|p245|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p245_022|p245|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p245_023|p245|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p245_037|p245|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p245_221|p245|We are in the hat.
p245_235|p245|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p245_209|p245|You have to do your research.
p245_355|p245|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p245_341|p245|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p245_194|p245|He knows a lot.
p245_180|p245|Is that success?
p245_157|p245|I drove the ball well.
p245_143|p245|I've learned from my mistakes.
p245_147|p245|The release attracted little attention.
p245_184|p245|They are in the euro.
p245_190|p245|Now, it's all right.
p245_345|p245|He was then replaced by Ross.
p245_351|p245|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p245_231|p245|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p245_225|p245|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p245_219|p245|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p245_033|p245|I was an athlete.
p245_027|p245|It's nice to hear.
p245_026|p245|But it failed.
p245_032|p245|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p245_218|p245|My wife and family are the support system.
p245_224|p245|It is not the message alone.
p245_230|p245|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p245_350|p245|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p245_344|p245|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p245_191|p245|It's like a garage.
p245_185|p245|He's not perfect.
p245_152|p245|It became a book by itself.
p245_146|p245|I was in the train station overnight.
p245_150|p245|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p245_144|p245|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p245_178|p245|It was still there, but right at the end.
p245_193|p245|Feel the heat?
p245_187|p245|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p245_352|p245|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p245_346|p245|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p245_226|p245|It's quite a line-up!
p245_232|p245|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p245_024|p245|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p245_030|p245|They should be so lucky.
p245_018|p245|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p245_019|p245|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p245_031|p245|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p245_025|p245|Johnson was pretty low.
p245_233|p245|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p245_227|p245|I might get an injury very easily.
p245_347|p245|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p245_353|p245|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p245_186|p245|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p245_192|p245|We don't even know his name.
p245_179|p245|The conference is the first test.
p245_145|p245|It has to be now.
p245_151|p245|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p245_136|p245|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p245_122|p245|What will happen then?
p245_308|p245|This is the culture change in medicine.
p245_334|p245|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p245_320|p245|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p245_268|p245|Of course I was tempted.
p245_240|p245|I was shocked.
p245_254|p245|they fail to engage.
p245_283|p245|The weather forecast isn't good.
p245_297|p245|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p245_042|p245|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p245_056|p245|Sadly, it can't.
p245_081|p245|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p245_095|p245|Oil embargo endorsed.
p245_094|p245|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p245_080|p245|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p245_057|p245|None has ever been found.
p245_043|p245|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p245_296|p245|They are wrong.
p245_282|p245|It goes back a long way.
p245_241|p245|They are different types.
p245_269|p245|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p245_321|p245|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p245_335|p245|The train was on time.
p245_309|p245|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p245_123|p245|Is that it?
p245_137|p245|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p245_109|p245|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p245_121|p245|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p245_135|p245|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p245_323|p245|I saw some good things.
p245_337|p245|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p245_257|p245|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p245_243|p245|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p245_294|p245|I thought it was my only chance.
p245_280|p245|Well, he can do it.
p245_069|p245|She died in hospital two hours later.
p245_055|p245|He had no enemies.
p245_041|p245|Indeed, he does.
p245_096|p245|No date has been set for the appeal.
p245_082|p245|It's never too late.
p245_083|p245|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p245_097|p245|It was an adventure.
p245_040|p245|It's a great thing.
p245_054|p245|They had to explain it.
p245_068|p245|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p245_281|p245|He was obviously very genuine.
p245_295|p245|Nothing is safe.
p245_242|p245|It was a hit.
p245_256|p245|I was happily surprised.
p245_336|p245|Action is needed now.
p245_322|p245|The boat was fantastic.
p245_134|p245|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p245_120|p245|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p245_108|p245|Who would have?
p245_124|p245|He was in a great deal of pain.
p245_130|p245|It is not just about pay.
p245_118|p245|He has been under great pressure.
p245_326|p245|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p245_332|p245|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p245_252|p245|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p245_246|p245|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p245_291|p245|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p245_285|p245|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p245_050|p245|Who can say?
p245_044|p245|But it took a lot of bottle.
p245_078|p245|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p245_093|p245|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p245_087|p245|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p245_086|p245|It is a lifeline.
p245_092|p245|He's a star.
p245_079|p245|We have other options.
p245_045|p245|Sure, it's funny.
p245_051|p245|It's a blessing.
p245_284|p245|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p245_290|p245|This is a huge confidence boost.
p245_247|p245|They need to look after themselves.
p245_253|p245|It's that kind of place.
p245_333|p245|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p245_327|p245|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p245_119|p245|Who will attend?
p245_131|p245|He will emerge as a world leader.
p245_125|p245|We want to keep the pound.
p245_133|p245|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p245_127|p245|There is a lack of chemistry.
p245_331|p245|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p245_325|p245|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p245_319|p245|My view has now completely changed.
p245_245|p245|This year I understood.
p245_251|p245|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p245_279|p245|It's very safe.
p245_286|p245|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p245_292|p245|He has retired.
p245_047|p245|This represents a tough game for us.
p245_053|p245|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p245_084|p245|Now the system is right behind us.
p245_090|p245|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p245_091|p245|They were outside the circle.
p245_085|p245|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p245_046|p245|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p245_293|p245|There was no hint of scandal.
p245_287|p245|That could change.
p245_278|p245|Yet, it worked.
p245_250|p245|It is nearly there.
p245_244|p245|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p245_318|p245|There was no time scale.
p245_324|p245|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p245_330|p245|Who will do it?
p245_126|p245|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p245_132|p245|They did very well.
p229_168|p229|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p229_197|p229|What has caused the demise of singing?
p229_183|p229|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p229_356|p229|It's the last thing on my mind.
p229_342|p229|Today she has been released.
p229_381|p229|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p229_222|p229|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p229_236|p229|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p229_020|p229|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p229_034|p229|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p229_008|p229|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p229_009|p229|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p229_035|p229|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p229_021|p229|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p229_237|p229|The track is currently covered in snow.
p229_223|p229|I am delighted for Simon.
p229_380|p229|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p229_343|p229|These days are long gone.
p229_357|p229|Tell us about it.
p229_182|p229|It is a memorial.
p229_196|p229|Four policemen were wounded.
p229_169|p229|Was this element always there?
p229_141|p229|Government will intervene.
p229_155|p229|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p229_143|p229|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p229_157|p229|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p229_180|p229|The post will be unpaid.
p229_194|p229|It is minute.
p229_341|p229|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p229_355|p229|It is long gone.
p229_369|p229|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p229_382|p229|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p229_235|p229|The boy is no longer with us.
p229_221|p229|She should not be blamed.
p229_209|p229|I came home by ambulance.
p229_037|p229|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p229_023|p229|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p229_022|p229|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p229_036|p229|I'd like to continue that record.
p229_220|p229|That is an important part of our role.
p229_234|p229|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p229_368|p229|I am a star.
p229_354|p229|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p229_340|p229|He did a good job.
p229_195|p229|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p229_181|p229|Does that put pressure on us?
p229_156|p229|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p229_142|p229|What will happen then?
p229_146|p229|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p229_152|p229|We just had a go.
p229_185|p229|One season, they might do well.
p229_191|p229|It is the whole package.
p229_378|p229|They play together perfectly.
p229_344|p229|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p229_350|p229|I'm very lucky.
p229_387|p229|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p229_218|p229|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p229_230|p229|Who was on the panel?
p229_224|p229|I had decided to quit the show.
p229_032|p229|Because we do not need it.
p229_026|p229|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p229_027|p229|It's nice to hear.
p229_033|p229|And we have a singer.
p229_225|p229|The FBI could become involved.
p229_231|p229|We've got the bronze.
p229_219|p229|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p229_392|p229|Yet the data is compelling.
p229_386|p229|Three years ago he would have been.
p229_351|p229|They may yet have the last laugh.
p229_345|p229|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p229_379|p229|It's a long process.
p229_190|p229|I drove the ball well.
p229_184|p229|They thought they had found a home.
p229_153|p229|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p229_147|p229|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p229_179|p229|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p229_151|p229|Who would be right?
p229_145|p229|This represents a tough game for us.
p229_192|p229|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p229_186|p229|Is Saddam a threat?
p229_353|p229|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p229_347|p229|I've got no secret.
p229_390|p229|There were no casualties.
p229_384|p229|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p229_227|p229|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p229_233|p229|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p229_019|p229|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p229_025|p229|Johnson was pretty low.
p229_031|p229|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p229_030|p229|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p229_024|p229|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p229_018|p229|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p229_232|p229|Saturday is gone.
p229_226|p229|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p229_391|p229|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p229_346|p229|Indeed, it was magical.
p229_352|p229|Everything was an effort.
p229_187|p229|The home was now under new management.
p229_193|p229|We knew nothing about it.
p229_144|p229|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p229_150|p229|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p229_178|p229|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p229_137|p229|He is slightly confused.
p229_123|p229|I'm delighted about that.
p229_335|p229|He told the court.
p229_309|p229|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p229_241|p229|We were a load of rubbish.
p229_255|p229|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p229_269|p229|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p229_282|p229|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p229_296|p229|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p229_043|p229|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p229_057|p229|She's a spy !
p229_080|p229|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p229_094|p229|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p229_095|p229|Until you hit the big games.
p229_081|p229|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p229_056|p229|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p229_042|p229|He did not know his daughter.
p229_297|p229|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p229_283|p229|It was a privilege to work for him.
p229_268|p229|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p229_254|p229|It was a hit.
p229_240|p229|We are so proud.
p229_308|p229|It's just not funny !
p229_320|p229|It's not even finished.
p229_334|p229|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p229_122|p229|Maybe this battle has been.
p229_136|p229|So the European elections are extremely important.
p229_120|p229|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p229_134|p229|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p229_108|p229|I didn't play well last year.
p229_322|p229|It should be equal.
p229_336|p229|The team for the first game could be this one.
p229_256|p229|This year I understood.
p229_242|p229|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p229_295|p229|These figures are truly awful.
p229_281|p229|People have no choice.
p229_054|p229|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p229_040|p229|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p229_068|p229|I was as strong as a horse.
p229_097|p229|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p229_083|p229|Someone who cares
p229_082|p229|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p229_096|p229|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p229_069|p229|Ferguson should take note.
p229_041|p229|It is not for any other purpose.
p229_055|p229|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p229_280|p229|I am an estate agent.
p229_294|p229|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p229_243|p229|It's an idea.
p229_257|p229|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p229_337|p229|They haven't got a hope.
p229_323|p229|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p229_109|p229|Before the game we went for a pint.
p229_135|p229|It's an amazing landscape !
p229_121|p229|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p229_119|p229|It's not fair.
p229_125|p229|It is rubbish.
p229_131|p229|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p229_333|p229|She did not attend the courtroom.
p229_253|p229|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p229_247|p229|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p229_290|p229|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p229_284|p229|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p229_079|p229|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p229_051|p229|It is difficult for Ali.
p229_045|p229|It will come all right.
p229_092|p229|It is an old family habit.
p229_086|p229|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p229_087|p229|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p229_093|p229|Well, the big day has arrived.
p229_044|p229|I was scared.
p229_050|p229|We need to chat.
p229_078|p229|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p229_285|p229|If not, he should go home.
p229_246|p229|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p229_252|p229|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p229_332|p229|I'd like to take the plunge.
p229_326|p229|I am very happy to be here.
p229_130|p229|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p229_124|p229|I joined a group.
p229_118|p229|The fire was above the hole.
p229_132|p229|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p229_126|p229|Who would be a referee?
p229_318|p229|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p229_330|p229|It could have gone either way.
p229_324|p229|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p229_278|p229|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p229_244|p229|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p229_250|p229|It's only fair.
p229_287|p229|I saw it at a ruck.
p229_293|p229|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p229_046|p229|But it took a lot of bottle.
p229_052|p229|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p229_085|p229|By then, he was walking on water.
p229_091|p229|We must look forward.
p229_090|p229|However, it did not end that way.
p229_084|p229|He can do everything.
p229_053|p229|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p229_047|p229|But it is all by design.
p229_292|p229|We have other options.
p229_286|p229|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p229_251|p229|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p229_245|p229|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p229_279|p229|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p229_325|p229|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p229_331|p229|He was then replaced by Ross.
p229_319|p229|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p229_127|p229|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
p229_133|p229|She really suffered for her art.
p229_116|p229|I was angry.
p229_102|p229|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p229_314|p229|It's certainly different.
p229_300|p229|I was brought up in a mining background.
p229_328|p229|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p229_260|p229|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p229_274|p229|We're in shock.
p229_248|p229|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p229_062|p229|Scotland had great assets.
p229_076|p229|I've not thought about it.
p229_089|p229|It is a lifeline.
p229_088|p229|They lived for their children.
p229_077|p229|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p229_063|p229|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p229_249|p229|The letters are going out today.
p229_275|p229|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p229_261|p229|I was happily surprised.
p229_329|p229|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p229_301|p229|I thought it was my only chance.
p229_315|p229|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p229_103|p229|It is a good day for the coalition.
p229_117|p229|They were behind the wheel.
p229_101|p229|She has so much to offer.
p229_115|p229|I came to complete.
p229_129|p229|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p229_303|p229|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p229_277|p229|It's a way of life.
p229_263|p229|The pensioners did not want to know.
p229_288|p229|I felt like I was a child.
p229_075|p229|It works for us.
p229_061|p229|Art is extra.
p229_048|p229|I am just going to go for it.
p229_060|p229|And a film maker was born.
p229_074|p229|It is a job creation scheme.
p229_289|p229|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p229_262|p229|They must play for each other.
p229_316|p229|This is the culture change in medicine.
p229_302|p229|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p229_128|p229|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p229_114|p229|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p229_100|p229|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p229_138|p229|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p229_104|p229|We work on the same level.
p229_110|p229|I'm not depressed.
p229_306|p229|This is a war over our home.
p229_312|p229|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p229_272|p229|He was also married with two children.
p229_266|p229|That is highly unfair.
p229_058|p229|What was the main difference?
p229_070|p229|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p229_064|p229|We should have known.
p229_065|p229|It is like a river running by my home.
p229_071|p229|Neither it is.
p229_059|p229|My mother is a widow.
p229_298|p229|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p229_267|p229|The warning is timely.
p229_273|p229|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p229_313|p229|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p229_307|p229|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p229_111|p229|It is normal.
p229_105|p229|They were outside the circle.
p229_139|p229|If not, a deal could take many months.
p229_113|p229|I don't have many friends.
p229_339|p229|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p229_311|p229|You are the glory.
p229_305|p229|There is no openness.
p229_259|p229|This is a big club.
p229_265|p229|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p229_271|p229|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p229_067|p229|That was the easy election.
p229_073|p229|It was chaotic.
p229_098|p229|She's got to say something.
p229_099|p229|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p229_072|p229|She died in hospital two hours later.
p229_066|p229|Try to save us.
p229_270|p229|They are never here.
p229_264|p229|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p229_258|p229|Kirkwood was arrested.
p229_304|p229|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p229_310|p229|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p229_338|p229|It has moved on in the last week.
p229_106|p229|Two of the team became ill.
p229_112|p229|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p229_175|p229|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p229_161|p229|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p229_149|p229|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p229_377|p229|Talks are progressing.
p229_363|p229|It benefits the whole family.
p229_388|p229|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p229_203|p229|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p229_217|p229|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p229_001|p229|Please call Stella.  
p229_015|p229|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p229_029|p229|I have a theory.
p229_028|p229|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p229_014|p229|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p229_216|p229|It was worth a photograph.
p229_202|p229|People will ask about us.
p229_389|p229|That's the name of the game, though.
p229_362|p229|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p229_376|p229|It is a simple equation.
p229_148|p229|Three penalties were given.
p229_160|p229|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p229_174|p229|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p229_162|p229|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p229_176|p229|We have to move forward.
p229_189|p229|The hotel was now for sale.
p229_360|p229|It was very formal.
p229_374|p229|It is not too late to get on board.
p229_348|p229|Look at the witnesses.
p229_214|p229|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p229_200|p229|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p229_228|p229|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p229_016|p229|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p229_002|p229|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p229_003|p229|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p229_017|p229|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p229_229|p229|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p229_201|p229|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p229_215|p229|The procedures were not in place.
p229_349|p229|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p229_361|p229|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p229_188|p229|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p229_177|p229|It's that sort of night.
p229_163|p229|It was by the numbers.
p229_167|p229|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p229_173|p229|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p229_198|p229|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p229_359|p229|That is a break with tradition.
p229_365|p229|We are looking for perfection.
p229_371|p229|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p229_239|p229|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p229_211|p229|It's the same old story.
p229_205|p229|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p229_013|p229|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p229_007|p229|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p229_006|p229|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p229_012|p229|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p229_204|p229|Last night was a key episode.
p229_210|p229|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p229_238|p229|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p229_370|p229|He could make it.
p229_364|p229|It was fit for royalty.
p229_358|p229|There is a cup final at stake.
p229_199|p229|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p229_172|p229|I will tell you.
p229_166|p229|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p229_158|p229|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p229_170|p229|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p229_164|p229|I knew he was good.
p229_366|p229|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p229_206|p229|It wasn't to be.
p229_212|p229|But we are not immune to the problem.
p229_038|p229|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p229_004|p229|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p229_010|p229|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p229_011|p229|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p229_005|p229|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p229_039|p229|They're just different.
p229_213|p229|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p229_207|p229|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p229_367|p229|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p229_373|p229|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p229_165|p229|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p229_171|p229|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p229_159|p229|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p227_077|p227|I first met him last summer.
p227_261|p227|You can feel at home in China.
p227_275|p227|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p227_249|p227|It is possible to be too good.
p227_315|p227|His job was not advertised.
p227_301|p227|It's hard to see it.
p227_329|p227|He would help me with the form.
p227_117|p227|This should begin in October.
p227_103|p227|It was never a starter.
p227_102|p227|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p227_116|p227|It is just a tax on employment.
p227_328|p227|The party lasted all night.
p227_300|p227|Stephen will get his first cap.
p227_314|p227|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
p227_248|p227|You will have seen the adverts.
p227_274|p227|The capital costs are modest.
p227_260|p227|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p227_076|p227|There may be reasons for it.
p227_062|p227|They have to come up with a solution.
p227_089|p227|You might not make it.
p227_074|p227|Even the one she loved.
p227_060|p227|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p227_048|p227|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p227_289|p227|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p227_276|p227|I told you I was ill.
p227_262|p227|Our decision making was poor.
p227_302|p227|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p227_316|p227|This is a big step up.
p227_100|p227|I had a fortunate war.
p227_114|p227|But we could only help a handful of people.
p227_128|p227|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p227_129|p227|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p227_101|p227|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p227_317|p227|It goes back a long way.
p227_303|p227|We have to be very, very careful.
p227_263|p227|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p227_277|p227|I can't get a job.
p227_288|p227|You get a lot for your money.
p227_049|p227|I expect a rapid response.
p227_061|p227|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p227_075|p227|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p227_059|p227|What do we do?
p227_071|p227|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p227_065|p227|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p227_298|p227|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p227_273|p227|No production contract is yet in sight.
p227_267|p227|What was the matter for concern?
p227_307|p227|Size is not the issue.
p227_313|p227|It could well be military.
p227_139|p227|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p227_105|p227|Such actions are rarely popular.
p227_111|p227|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p227_110|p227|That admission is not surprising.
p227_104|p227|And the match was not too bad, either.
p227_138|p227|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p227_312|p227|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
p227_306|p227|It is an amazing response.
p227_266|p227|Was everything done to save people?
p227_272|p227|I should think so, too.
p227_299|p227|She failed in her action.
p227_064|p227|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p227_070|p227|Then followed a bout of flu.
p227_058|p227|Do I have a favourite?
p227_099|p227|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p227_066|p227|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p227_072|p227|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p227_258|p227|Nato was not a love affair.
p227_264|p227|The baby deserves the credit.
p227_270|p227|Did he trip?
p227_338|p227|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p227_310|p227|We are not increasing the number.
p227_304|p227|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p227_112|p227|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p227_106|p227|It is safe in our hands.
p227_107|p227|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p227_113|p227|However, we have to be cautious.
p227_305|p227|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p227_311|p227|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p227_339|p227|So what happens next?
p227_271|p227|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p227_265|p227|And they were being paid?
p227_259|p227|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p227_073|p227|It is a terrible place.
p227_067|p227|I have proved that in the past.
p227_098|p227|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p227_014|p227|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p227_028|p227|We will look into it.
p227_216|p227|You have caught a serial killer.
p227_389|p227|In due course the deal was done.
p227_376|p227|Italy was just behind the US.
p227_174|p227|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p227_160|p227|Seven people were later detained by police.
p227_148|p227|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p227_149|p227|That was the difference between the sides.
p227_161|p227|They want to see him.
p227_175|p227|The jury is still out.
p227_363|p227|We are encouraged by the news.
p227_377|p227|It was forced to divert.
p227_388|p227|There is no deal as yet.
p227_217|p227|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p227_203|p227|It was served by sheriff officers.
p227_029|p227|This is a central issue.
p227_015|p227|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p227_001|p227|Please call Stella.  
p227_017|p227|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p227_003|p227|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p227_215|p227|Who was she?
p227_201|p227|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p227_229|p227|It's just a normal life.
p227_361|p227|A report is expected next month.
p227_375|p227|It is a stroke of genius.
p227_349|p227|I came into this world with nothing.
p227_188|p227|We've just had it confirmed.
p227_163|p227|Nobody did in those days.
p227_177|p227|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p227_176|p227|But he has a lifeline.
p227_162|p227|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p227_189|p227|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
p227_348|p227|In the old days, it was easy.
p227_374|p227|It has been made to entertain.
p227_360|p227|He is not very big, either.
p227_228|p227|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p227_200|p227|I guess I was lucky, though.
p227_214|p227|I think, therefore I am?
p227_002|p227|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p227_016|p227|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p227_012|p227|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p227_006|p227|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p227_238|p227|William Hague delighted his party.
p227_210|p227|This is a holy place.
p227_204|p227|This will be our new beginning.
p227_358|p227|Of course, we want to go home.
p227_364|p227|Had this been common practice?
p227_402|p227|Persuaded to change his mind.
p227_370|p227|We need to be prepared.
p227_199|p227|He made no order on costs.
p227_166|p227|What happened in that game?
p227_172|p227|One season, they might do well.
p227_173|p227|They made such decisions in London.
p227_167|p227|Are you going to win?
p227_198|p227|If the director is with you.
p227_371|p227|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p227_365|p227|What do they want us to do?
p227_359|p227|I am very interested in the subject.
p227_205|p227|They have the cash and the fire power.
p227_211|p227|Does the name matter?
p227_239|p227|There is a world of difference.
p227_013|p227|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p227_039|p227|Among them are many criminals.
p227_005|p227|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p227_011|p227|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p227_207|p227|That might mean another delay.
p227_213|p227|What are you not good at?
p227_398|p227|I can hardly believe it.
p227_373|p227|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p227_401|p227|After the match, do you?
p227_367|p227|Does it matter?
p227_159|p227|He was in great spirits.
p227_171|p227|The people are the hero.
p227_165|p227|We've made a couple of albums.
p227_164|p227|There is no signature on this document.
p227_170|p227|What do we want to do that for?
p227_158|p227|It is difficult to say.
p227_400|p227|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p227_366|p227|Is it worth it?
p227_372|p227|His views are hardly surprising.
p227_399|p227|How do you take them away?
p227_212|p227|how do you get it back?
p227_206|p227|My heart is with the artist.
p227_010|p227|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p227_004|p227|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p227_038|p227|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p227_021|p227|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p227_035|p227|I became a widow overnight.
p227_009|p227|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p227_223|p227|That might help a bit.
p227_237|p227|We can certainly build on this.
p227_394|p227|I wanted to go out on a high.
p227_380|p227|We are still getting over it.
p227_357|p227|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p227_343|p227|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p227_196|p227|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p227_155|p227|It was a funny feeling.
p227_141|p227|He's not a Celtic man.
p227_169|p227|Why change it?
p227_168|p227|Was it the wife?
p227_140|p227|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p227_154|p227|The strong pound also took its toll.
p227_183|p227|I have spoken to head office.
p227_197|p227|The force is with them.
p227_342|p227|Have a look at this lot.
p227_356|p227|They were the acts of men.
p227_395|p227|I felt the head was very like me.
p227_236|p227|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p227_222|p227|They have known the hard times.
p227_008|p227|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p227_034|p227|President Bush is at war.
p227_020|p227|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p227_036|p227|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p227_022|p227|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p227_220|p227|There is no quick fix.
p227_208|p227|However, it is not as simple as this.
p227_383|p227|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p227_397|p227|They have not got anyone.
p227_340|p227|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p227_354|p227|Whether this return was too soon.
p227_368|p227|A crucial moment has arrived.
p227_181|p227|I think it's a good sign.
p227_195|p227|I'm interested in interesting work.
p227_142|p227|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p227_156|p227|I'd love to be like Peter.
p227_157|p227|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p227_143|p227|So I got a blood test.
p227_194|p227|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
p227_180|p227|That will apply to both sets of fans.
p227_369|p227|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p227_355|p227|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p227_341|p227|I am not obsessed with sex.
p227_396|p227|It is a terrible equation.
p227_382|p227|This will impact on us.
p227_209|p227|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p227_235|p227|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p227_023|p227|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p227_037|p227|This represents a tough game for us.
p227_033|p227|It is not for any other purpose.
p227_027|p227|I feel I did not have enough time.
p227_219|p227|They make a selective perception process.
p227_231|p227|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p227_386|p227|I do not like to lose.
p227_392|p227|That's not like us at all.
p227_379|p227|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p227_345|p227|The king is delighted by the honour.
p227_351|p227|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p227_184|p227|Well, you can have a tree.
p227_190|p227|This is the time to use it.
p227_147|p227|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p227_153|p227|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p227_152|p227|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p227_146|p227|Like the others, he was arrested.
p227_191|p227|You know the sort of thing.
p227_350|p227|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
p227_344|p227|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p227_378|p227|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p227_393|p227|You have to rely on each other.
p227_387|p227|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
p227_230|p227|He must get to know himself.
p227_218|p227|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p227_026|p227|Movement has to take place.
p227_032|p227|There, you were just a body.
p227_018|p227|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain. 
p227_024|p227|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p227_030|p227|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p227_226|p227|I'm just a regular person.
p227_232|p227|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p227_391|p227|They will fight for everything.
p227_385|p227|The salary changes are long overdue.
p227_352|p227|There was no time scale.
p227_193|p227|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p227_187|p227|He is believed to live in Britain.
p227_178|p227|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p227_150|p227|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p227_144|p227|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p227_145|p227|These men are a part of India.
p227_151|p227|I was shaking on the blocks.
p227_179|p227|It makes no influence on the public.
p227_186|p227|They bought the property four years ago.
p227_192|p227|They were seriously after him.
p227_347|p227|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p227_353|p227|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p227_384|p227|He is in the queue.
p227_390|p227|Celtic were pleased to help.
p227_233|p227|The fight is under way.
p227_227|p227|My daughter is an adult.
p227_031|p227|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p227_025|p227|Meetings will also remain private.
p227_019|p227|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p227_081|p227|By then, he was walking on water.
p227_095|p227|You are like an animal.
p227_042|p227|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p227_056|p227|How are you, sir?
p227_283|p227|Every one is a winner.
p227_297|p227|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p227_240|p227|We played them off the pitch.
p227_254|p227|It is a court case.
p227_268|p227|Do I think about them often?
p227_334|p227|What form did that take?
p227_320|p227|In that case, the children were not missing.
p227_308|p227|He will address the nation this evening.
p227_136|p227|This is a limited market.
p227_122|p227|So, did she meet him?
p227_123|p227|So what is the campaign about?
p227_137|p227|Our position is quite simple.
p227_309|p227|We have the easy part.
p227_321|p227|I have got a victim.
p227_335|p227|Are they free?
p227_269|p227|Is it in the right place?
p227_255|p227|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p227_241|p227|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p227_296|p227|My body is a wreck.
p227_282|p227|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p227_057|p227|So is that it, then?
p227_043|p227|I'd come back from London.
p227_094|p227|Their attitude is all wrong.
p227_080|p227|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p227_096|p227|No, the equipment is extra.
p227_082|p227|We have to offer value for money.
p227_055|p227|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p227_041|p227|He looks like an Afghan.
p227_069|p227|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p227_294|p227|But the plot is not the point.
p227_280|p227|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p227_257|p227|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p227_243|p227|My wife and family are the support system.
p227_323|p227|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p227_337|p227|Is there a waiting list?
p227_121|p227|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p227_135|p227|We could easily have lost that game.
p227_109|p227|You can spend money on housing.
p227_108|p227|It is much as it has been described.
p227_134|p227|It is a vicious circle.
p227_120|p227|Why do it otherwise?
p227_336|p227|What are they for?
p227_322|p227|The judge was really nice.
p227_242|p227|I can't wait to meet him.
p227_256|p227|She took them for a term.
p227_281|p227|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p227_295|p227|It was never a free kick.
p227_068|p227|He had been a singer.
p227_040|p227|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p227_054|p227|I could not do it.
p227_083|p227|They lived for their children.
p227_097|p227|The following are the principal provisions.
p227_093|p227|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p227_087|p227|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p227_078|p227|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p227_050|p227|That is very hard, alone.
p227_044|p227|If I was a woman.
p227_291|p227|It was an easy decision to come here.
p227_285|p227|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p227_252|p227|The irony was not lost.
p227_246|p227|She died in middle age.
p227_326|p227|The dealer is on notice.
p227_332|p227|I would do away with the dress code.
p227_118|p227|My life has changed a lot.
p227_124|p227|And does it?
p227_130|p227|He is a great addition to our team.
p227_131|p227|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
p227_125|p227|You've got to be vigilant.
p227_119|p227|We did what we had to do.
p227_333|p227|It is so easy to be negative.
p227_327|p227|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
p227_247|p227|It is set in Paris.
p227_253|p227|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p227_284|p227|There's not much money in cycling.
p227_290|p227|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p227_045|p227|He was a home referee.
p227_051|p227|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p227_079|p227|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p227_086|p227|This is a complex and detailed report.
p227_092|p227|For once, you should believe the hype.
p227_084|p227|Potions said he would drive.
p227_090|p227|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p227_047|p227|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p227_053|p227|Four other charges were dropped.
p227_286|p227|Not many companies can say that these days.
p227_292|p227|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p227_279|p227|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p227_245|p227|It is the voice of the survivors.
p227_251|p227|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
p227_319|p227|We have a clean bill of health.
p227_331|p227|I'm not worried about the critics.
p227_133|p227|They could use a boost.
p227_127|p227|Any success would have been an improvement.
p227_126|p227|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
p227_132|p227|I felt he was excellent.
p227_324|p227|McNaughton was not so sure.
p227_330|p227|There's still a bit to go.
p227_318|p227|The weather forecast isn't good.
p227_250|p227|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p227_244|p227|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p227_278|p227|That could be in place by next year.
p227_293|p227|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p227_287|p227|They can leave at any time.
p227_052|p227|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p227_046|p227|There was no safety net.
p227_091|p227|That is the important thing.
p227_085|p227|The latter is due to be finished in February.
p244_310|p244|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
p244_106|p244|Victory was never in doubt.
p244_112|p244|But he has not become a monster.
p244_072|p244|It is only the beginning.
p244_066|p244|There is a lot to be done.
p244_099|p244|By then, he was walking on water.
p244_258|p244|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p244_270|p244|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p244_264|p244|It expected this trend to continue.
p244_265|p244|However, no further action was taken by police.
p244_271|p244|But the government has so far failed to listen.
p244_259|p244|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
p244_098|p244|It took an option on the process.
p244_067|p244|But that's another story for another day.
p244_073|p244|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p244_113|p244|He is not a dancer.
p244_107|p244|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p244_311|p244|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p244_305|p244|There was a hole in it.
p244_339|p244|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p244_313|p244|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p244_307|p244|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p244_139|p244|And does it?
p244_111|p244|There, you were just a body.
p244_105|p244|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p244_059|p244|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p244_065|p244|That is all in the past.
p244_071|p244|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p244_267|p244|But we were in control at that point.
p244_273|p244|I am still waiting for a reply.
p244_298|p244|What form did that take?
p244_299|p244|Are they free?
p244_272|p244|He must have a crack at it.
p244_266|p244|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p244_070|p244|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p244_064|p244|We felt it was sufficient.
p244_058|p244|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p244_104|p244|The trick is to try it.
p244_110|p244|Then again, we could have.
p244_138|p244|So what is the campaign about?
p244_306|p244|It will be done in stages.
p244_312|p244|In that moment, I was happy.
p244_316|p244|It involved the same people.
p244_302|p244|This is a historic agreement.
p244_114|p244|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
p244_100|p244|This is a game of confidence.
p244_128|p244|It was far from business as usual.
p244_060|p244|We have got to deliver.
p244_074|p244|Only water is currently allowed.
p244_048|p244|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p244_262|p244|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p244_276|p244|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p244_288|p244|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p244_277|p244|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p244_263|p244|The performance continues to improve.
p244_049|p244|That is still the case.
p244_075|p244|This time, it might be for real.
p244_061|p244|That was the difference today.
p244_129|p244|He wanted to record the group.
p244_101|p244|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p244_115|p244|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p244_303|p244|We have to be realistic.
p244_317|p244|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p244_301|p244|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p244_315|p244|They were not at the property yesterday.
p244_329|p244|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p244_103|p244|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
p244_117|p244|This is a sea change in approach.
p244_077|p244|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p244_063|p244|He said it was for sale.
p244_088|p244|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p244_275|p244|He was good, but not that good.
p244_261|p244|But it was a loss.
p244_249|p244|Did he trip?
p244_248|p244|Is it in the right place?
p244_260|p244|That is not the case in Europe.
p244_274|p244|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p244_089|p244|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p244_062|p244|The company continues to grow.
p244_076|p244|She did that for the rest of her life.
p244_116|p244|In the end we have to take a stand.
p244_102|p244|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p244_328|p244|Another difference is the cost.
p244_314|p244|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p244_300|p244|Scotland won by six wickets.
p244_367|p244|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p244_401|p244|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p244_415|p244|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p244_373|p244|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
p244_398|p244|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p244_159|p244|If not, a deal could take many months.
p244_165|p244|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p244_171|p244|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p244_039|p244|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p244_011|p244|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p244_005|p244|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p244_213|p244|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p244_207|p244|He played it like a veteran.
p244_206|p244|We can take the city.
p244_212|p244|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p244_004|p244|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p244_010|p244|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p244_038|p244|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p244_170|p244|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
p244_164|p244|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p244_158|p244|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p244_399|p244|I want this one to be different.
p244_414|p244|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p244_372|p244|The news is not all bad.
p244_366|p244|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p244_400|p244|It is the last meeting of the season.
p244_358|p244|The challenge is to win a cup.
p244_370|p244|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p244_416|p244|There is no need to panic.
p244_402|p244|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p244_364|p244|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
p244_172|p244|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p244_166|p244|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p244_199|p244|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p244_006|p244|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p244_012|p244|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p244_238|p244|We have an election in eight days.
p244_204|p244|It is not an issue.
p244_210|p244|As many as the market will support.
p244_211|p244|He is believed to live in Britain.
p244_205|p244|They have to get that sorted.
p244_239|p244|There was a lot of resentment.
p244_013|p244|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p244_007|p244|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p244_198|p244|I would like to continue to develop.
p244_167|p244|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p244_173|p244|We were all over the place in the first half.
p244_403|p244|He is a quality player.
p244_365|p244|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p244_371|p244|I have a good feeling about this.
p244_417|p244|It had been on the cards.
p244_359|p244|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p244_413|p244|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p244_375|p244|It is almost certain to be the last.
p244_361|p244|Either team will be hard.
p244_407|p244|It's great that it happened in Britain.
p244_349|p244|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p244_177|p244|They have not been named.
p244_163|p244|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p244_188|p244|That is a question for the next manager.
p244_003|p244|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p244_017|p244|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p244_201|p244|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
p244_215|p244|A team is a team.
p244_229|p244|It still has an effect.
p244_228|p244|We want this place to work.
p244_214|p244|This conference was never confirmed.
p244_200|p244|He has defended the system.
p244_016|p244|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p244_002|p244|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p244_189|p244|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p244_162|p244|There is a lack of staff.
p244_176|p244|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p244_348|p244|We never played at all.
p244_360|p244|It was a test in itself.
p244_406|p244|There is a demand for it.
p244_412|p244|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p244_374|p244|However, it does not seem to be the case.
p244_404|p244|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
p244_362|p244|The parents will have a great time, too.
p244_376|p244|You have to be patient.
p244_410|p244|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p244_389|p244|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p244_160|p244|We want to get there.
p244_174|p244|Like the others, he was arrested.
p244_148|p244|I am the manager of Scotland.
p244_014|p244|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p244_028|p244|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p244_216|p244|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p244_203|p244|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p244_217|p244|I'm interested in interesting work.
p244_029|p244|It is about investing in the future.
p244_001|p244|Please call Stella.  
p244_015|p244|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p244_149|p244|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p244_175|p244|All the pressure was on him.
p244_161|p244|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p244_388|p244|I would be interested in another attempt.
p244_377|p244|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p244_411|p244|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p244_405|p244|It's all been about the basics of the business.
p244_363|p244|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p244_408|p244|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p244_346|p244|The banking sector was weak.
p244_420|p244|That might mean another delay.
p244_352|p244|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p244_385|p244|Everything is in the mix.
p244_391|p244|Does it matter?
p244_178|p244|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p244_144|p244|I have been in contact with him.
p244_150|p244|There were no grounds for his action.
p244_187|p244|It is difficult to say.
p244_193|p244|Was it the wife?
p244_018|p244|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p244_030|p244|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p244_024|p244|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p244_232|p244|Other villages were completely deserted.
p244_226|p244|I was not overly concerned about this.
p244_227|p244|However, it is not as simple as this.
p244_233|p244|There is a lot of concern.
p244_025|p244|We are a service industry.
p244_031|p244|They were in good humour, too.
p244_019|p244|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p244_192|p244|Are you going to win?
p244_186|p244|The feeling is hard to describe.
p244_151|p244|I can't even get into the A team.
p244_145|p244|Actors like to be in the centre.
p244_179|p244|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
p244_390|p244|He was on a mission.
p244_384|p244|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
p244_353|p244|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p244_347|p244|But the New Year was special.
p244_421|p244|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p244_409|p244|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p244_379|p244|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p244_351|p244|He is a great prospect.
p244_423|p244|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p244_345|p244|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p244_392|p244|How do you take them away?
p244_386|p244|An announcement is expected this week.
p244_153|p244|Others are expected to follow the lead.
p244_147|p244|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p244_190|p244|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p244_184|p244|It should never have happened.
p244_027|p244|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
p244_033|p244|It is on the internet.
p244_219|p244|THE force is with them.
p244_225|p244|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
p244_231|p244|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p244_230|p244|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p244_224|p244|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p244_218|p244|It decided to blame the media.
p244_032|p244|The end result is the same.
p244_026|p244|It may be good for the soul.
p244_185|p244|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p244_191|p244|It is simply not true.
p244_146|p244|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p244_152|p244|It starts at the top.
p244_387|p244|He will be difficult to replace.
p244_393|p244|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p244_422|p244|I am delighted for them.
p244_344|p244|And the context is also completely different.
p244_350|p244|This isn't the end of story.
p244_378|p244|I was delighted to accept.
p244_354|p244|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
p244_340|p244|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
p244_368|p244|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p244_397|p244|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p244_383|p244|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p244_156|p244|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p244_142|p244|That was the first step.
p244_195|p244|What do we want to do that for?
p244_181|p244|I was always in control.
p244_022|p244|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p244_036|p244|This is a central issue.
p244_220|p244|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p244_234|p244|It will be decided in the next month.
p244_208|p244|It was the story of the second half.
p244_209|p244|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p244_235|p244|We have to win the group.
p244_221|p244|It was important to win today.
p244_037|p244|History is in the making.
p244_023|p244|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p244_180|p244|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p244_194|p244|Why change it?
p244_143|p244|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p244_157|p244|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p244_382|p244|It's fantastic to win again.
p244_396|p244|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p244_369|p244|However, it was well worth the wait.
p244_341|p244|However, a bid was never made.
p244_355|p244|This latter suggestion is very important.
p244_343|p244|Something is going to have to give.
p244_357|p244|They were impressive against France.
p244_419|p244|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p244_380|p244|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
p244_394|p244|After the match, do you?
p244_141|p244|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p244_155|p244|It was all for good reason as well.
p244_169|p244|Anyone can do the sums.
p244_182|p244|It was by the numbers.
p244_196|p244|Does the name matter?
p244_035|p244|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p244_009|p244|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p244_237|p244|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p244_223|p244|Because he was born in England.
p244_222|p244|He was not injured in the attack.
p244_236|p244|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p244_008|p244|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p244_020|p244|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p244_034|p244|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p244_197|p244|That you can do it.
p244_183|p244|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p244_168|p244|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p244_154|p244|She does not want to speak.
p244_140|p244|Are you from the rugby?
p244_395|p244|One-third of the places are already taken.
p244_381|p244|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p244_418|p244|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
p244_356|p244|However, it does not tell the full story.
p244_424|p244|But it was a struggle.
p244_342|p244|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p244_319|p244|Look at the potential of this club.
p244_325|p244|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p244_331|p244|What are they for?
p244_127|p244|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p244_133|p244|Or it would have been.
p244_053|p244|Their campaign is in disarray.
p244_047|p244|The whole thing is the music.
p244_090|p244|It seems a good thing to try.
p244_084|p244|Why do it otherwise?
p244_279|p244|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p244_251|p244|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p244_245|p244|was everything done to save people?
p244_292|p244|I didn't see the point.
p244_286|p244|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
p244_287|p244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p244_293|p244|This idea has been around for four years.
p244_244|p244|And they were being paid?
p244_250|p244|Sadly, it could not be done.
p244_278|p244|However, the matter is not going to end there.
p244_085|p244|It starts with the script.
p244_091|p244|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p244_046|p244|It is all about the story.
p244_052|p244|The pressure on the players will build.
p244_132|p244|It is hard to believe.
p244_126|p244|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
p244_330|p244|And we can do it.
p244_324|p244|However, the devil is in the detail.
p244_318|p244|We have to be very, very careful.
p244_326|p244|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p244_118|p244|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p244_130|p244|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p244_124|p244|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p244_078|p244|That will be the office.
p244_044|p244|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p244_050|p244|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p244_087|p244|It would have been around the turn of the century.
p244_093|p244|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p244_246|p244|What was the matter for concern?
p244_252|p244|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p244_285|p244|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p244_291|p244|None of the agencies was able to help.
p244_290|p244|I should think so, too.
p244_284|p244|It is important that he is involved.
p244_253|p244|Instead, he missed the lot.
p244_247|p244|Do I think about them often?
p244_092|p244|It sounds a lot of money.
p244_086|p244|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p244_051|p244|In my view, it has to be done.
p244_045|p244|They are going after them.
p244_079|p244|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p244_125|p244|We had a great time.
p244_131|p244|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p244_119|p244|The procedures were not in place.
p244_327|p244|He is already in place.
p244_333|p244|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p244_337|p244|They have to be addressed.
p244_323|p244|But it is up again.
p244_135|p244|Football is a passion for many.
p244_121|p244|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p244_109|p244|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p244_041|p244|In London today, it was business as usual.
p244_055|p244|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p244_069|p244|It was an outstanding performance.
p244_082|p244|Do I have a favourite?
p244_096|p244|He is in the US.
p244_243|p244|The matter is under appeal.
p244_257|p244|It was really good in the first week.
p244_280|p244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p244_294|p244|We are in a war.
p244_295|p244|Do you think we are a top nation?
p244_281|p244|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p244_256|p244|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p244_242|p244|He is a man of the people.
p244_097|p244|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p244_083|p244|What do we do?
p244_068|p244|He has not been dropped.
p244_054|p244|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p244_040|p244|She was at the top.
p244_108|p244|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
p244_120|p244|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p244_134|p244|Three days later, he was killed.
p244_322|p244|We did something about it.
p244_336|p244|It is a sensitive issue.
p244_320|p244|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p244_334|p244|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p244_308|p244|Every character was completely different.
p244_122|p244|He was not alone at the top of the board.
p244_136|p244|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p244_056|p244|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p244_042|p244|And they had a case.
p244_095|p244|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p244_081|p244|So is that it, then?
p244_254|p244|I was never in danger.
p244_240|p244|This is a fight to the death.
p244_268|p244|It has to be enforced.
p244_297|p244|How independent is that?
p244_283|p244|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p244_282|p244|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p244_296|p244|Is our children learning?
p244_269|p244|The party has never fully recovered.
p244_241|p244|All will be revealed in due course.
p244_255|p244|A lot has been written.
p244_080|p244|How are you, sir?
p244_094|p244|It is not a story.
p244_043|p244|Something has to be put in place.
p244_057|p244|Clearly, they had other problems.
p244_137|p244|So, did she meet him?
p244_123|p244|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p244_309|p244|But it is a similar problem.
p244_335|p244|And it's a goodbye from him.
p244_321|p244|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p243_146|p243|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p243_152|p243|Did it work?
p243_387|p243|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p243_393|p243|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p243_378|p243|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p243_344|p243|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p243_350|p243|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p243_218|p243|A European final must be the millennium target.
p243_230|p243|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p243_224|p243|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p243_032|p243|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p243_026|p243|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p243_027|p243|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p243_033|p243|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p243_225|p243|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p243_231|p243|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p243_219|p243|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p243_345|p243|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p243_379|p243|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p243_392|p243|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p243_386|p243|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p243_153|p243|Do you think we are a top nation?
p243_147|p243|You should feel involved in their lives.
p243_190|p243|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p243_184|p243|We have come a long way since then.
p243_192|p243|I am fighting the force of nature.
p243_186|p243|A great player has to win major championships.
p243_179|p243|Nato has left them with no other option.
p243_151|p243|Does that put pressure on us?
p243_145|p243|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p243_390|p243|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p243_384|p243|What do we do?
p243_353|p243|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p243_347|p243|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p243_227|p243|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p243_233|p243|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p243_019|p243|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p243_025|p243|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p243_031|p243|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p243_030|p243|She brought a lot to my life.
p243_024|p243|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p243_018|p243|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p243_232|p243|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p243_226|p243|If not, a deal could take many months.
p243_346|p243|It was a bit like having children.
p243_352|p243|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p243_385|p243|Why do it otherwise?
p243_391|p243|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p243_144|p243|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p243_150|p243|Did he trip?
p243_178|p243|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p243_187|p243|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p243_193|p243|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p243_197|p243|What was the matter for concern?
p243_183|p243|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p243_154|p243|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p243_140|p243|There was only one living room, you see.
p243_168|p243|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p243_395|p243|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p243_381|p243|This is not a small amount of money.
p243_356|p243|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p243_342|p243|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p243_222|p243|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p243_236|p243|That is the last thing they need.
p243_020|p243|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p243_034|p243|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p243_008|p243|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p243_009|p243|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p243_035|p243|It is about control of our economy.
p243_021|p243|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p243_237|p243|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p243_223|p243|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p243_343|p243|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p243_357|p243|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p243_380|p243|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p243_394|p243|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p243_169|p243|We had to work very hard for our points.
p243_141|p243|I am not under any new pressure.
p243_155|p243|Time may already have run out for this option.
p243_182|p243|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p243_196|p243|was everything done to save people?
p243_180|p243|I am secure in my own position.
p243_194|p243|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p243_143|p243|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p243_157|p243|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p243_382|p243|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p243_396|p243|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p243_341|p243|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p243_355|p243|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p243_369|p243|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p243_235|p243|You are not allowed to do that.
p243_221|p243|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p243_209|p243|They are a victim of their own success.
p243_037|p243|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p243_023|p243|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p243_022|p243|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p243_036|p243|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p243_208|p243|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p243_220|p243|I was independent but I am not now.
p243_234|p243|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p243_368|p243|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p243_354|p243|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p243_340|p243|Do I have a favourite?
p243_397|p243|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p243_383|p243|I just felt that I was broken down.
p243_156|p243|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p243_142|p243|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p243_195|p243|And they were being paid?
p243_181|p243|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p243_119|p243|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p243_125|p243|I think there's not much between them.
p243_131|p243|He's got to look after himself now.
p243_327|p243|I try to be open to experience.
p243_333|p243|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p243_290|p243|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p243_284|p243|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p243_253|p243|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p243_247|p243|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p243_092|p243|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p243_086|p243|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p243_079|p243|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p243_051|p243|I'm as fit as I can get.
p243_045|p243|Does it matter?
p243_044|p243|Is it worth it?
p243_050|p243|Have I really come to this?
p243_078|p243|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243_087|p243|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p243_093|p243|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p243_246|p243|I think, therefore I am?
p243_252|p243|The rise has come too late for some.
p243_291|p243|He would get into any world team.
p243_332|p243|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p243_326|p243|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p243_130|p243|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p243_118|p243|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p243_132|p243|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p243_126|p243|So I am going in the right direction.
p243_318|p243|I always felt they played for me.
p243_330|p243|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p243_324|p243|It is not either national standards or local control.
p243_287|p243|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p243_293|p243|They first met during a Step in London.
p243_278|p243|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p243_244|p243|how do you get it back?
p243_250|p243|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p243_085|p243|No plan for projects are yet in place.
p243_091|p243|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p243_046|p243|How do you take them away?
p243_052|p243|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p243_053|p243|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243_047|p243|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p243_090|p243|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p243_084|p243|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p243_251|p243|However, the figures tell a different story.
p243_245|p243|What are you not good at?
p243_279|p243|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p243_292|p243|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p243_286|p243|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p243_325|p243|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p243_331|p243|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p243_319|p243|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p243_127|p243|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p243_133|p243|No country has a similar training programme.
p243_137|p243|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p243_123|p243|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p243_335|p243|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p243_321|p243|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p243_309|p243|It happened on average once a week this year.
p243_282|p243|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p243_296|p243|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p243_241|p243|Why change it?
p243_255|p243|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p243_269|p243|They always want to give a performance.
p243_080|p243|They said our costs were too high.
p243_094|p243|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p243_043|p243|He too started on the subs seats.
p243_057|p243|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p243_056|p243|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p243_042|p243|He does not even trust his own members.
p243_095|p243|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p243_081|p243|I do not attempt to answer that.
p243_268|p243|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p243_254|p243|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p243_240|p243|Was it the wife?
p243_297|p243|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p243_283|p243|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p243_308|p243|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p243_320|p243|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p243_334|p243|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p243_122|p243|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p243_136|p243|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p243_120|p243|It is the right package for Scotland.
p243_134|p243|There is no future in rock music.
p243_108|p243|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p243_322|p243|We will not simply hit these people.
p243_336|p243|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p243_295|p243|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p243_281|p243|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p243_256|p243|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p243_242|p243|What do we want to do that for?
p243_097|p243|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p243_083|p243|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p243_054|p243|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p243_040|p243|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p243_068|p243|But it was not all bad news.
p243_069|p243|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p243_041|p243|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243_055|p243|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243_082|p243|It's been a great evening for us.
p243_096|p243|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p243_243|p243|Does the name matter?
p243_257|p243|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p243_280|p243|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p243_294|p243|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p243_337|p243|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p243_323|p243|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p243_109|p243|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p243_135|p243|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p243_121|p243|They have no real friends in the region.
p243_138|p243|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p243_104|p243|They won't actually make any money from it.
p243_110|p243|Some young girls also came by last night.
p243_306|p243|Are you going to win?
p243_312|p243|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p243_299|p243|He could understand both points of view.
p243_272|p243|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p243_266|p243|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p243_058|p243|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p243_070|p243|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p243_064|p243|It also has a good labour supply.
p243_065|p243|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p243_071|p243|It turned me against the whole system.
p243_059|p243|We just want this season to end.
p243_267|p243|The board do not own the company.
p243_273|p243|I think I was about four years old.
p243_298|p243|It is based on population rather than need.
p243_313|p243|For that reason cover should not be given.
p243_111|p243|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p243_105|p243|I bought a flat six years ago.
p243_139|p243|The programme has been made with great care.
p243_113|p243|Is there a waiting list?
p243_107|p243|They are a different team at home.
p243_339|p243|So is that it, then?
p243_311|p243|He is keen to stay in public service.
p243_305|p243|What happened in that game?
p243_259|p243|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p243_265|p243|His condition was described as serious last night.
p243_271|p243|That's been the difference between the sides.
p243_098|p243|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p243_067|p243|He was failed by his health authority.
p243_073|p243|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p243_072|p243|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p243_066|p243|Do not give your details to anyone.
p243_099|p243|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p243_270|p243|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p243_264|p243|The two companies were not for sale.
p243_258|p243|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p243_304|p243|Had I heard?
p243_310|p243|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p243_338|p243|How are you, sir?
p243_106|p243|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p243_112|p243|What are they for?
p243_116|p243|Had this been common practice?
p243_102|p243|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p243_314|p243|He felt too close to head office.
p243_300|p243|So, did she meet him?
p243_328|p243|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p243_260|p243|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p243_274|p243|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p243_248|p243|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p243_089|p243|I feel I did not have enough time.
p243_062|p243|The referee is there to decide these things.
p243_076|p243|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p243_077|p243|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p243_063|p243|There were no details of the other five victims.
p243_088|p243|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p243_249|p243|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p243_275|p243|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p243_261|p243|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p243_329|p243|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p243_301|p243|So what is the campaign about?
p243_315|p243|If you believe in the blue and white.
p243_103|p243|We were under a bit of pressure.
p243_117|p243|What do they want us to do?
p243_101|p243|We are already seeing some positive results.
p243_115|p243|So what happens next?
p243_129|p243|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p243_303|p243|Are you from the rugby?
p243_317|p243|He will just go on doing his job.
p243_288|p243|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p243_277|p243|I think the shares are good value.
p243_263|p243|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p243_075|p243|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p243_061|p243|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p243_049|p243|Has the conflict started?
p243_048|p243|After the match, do you?
p243_060|p243|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p243_074|p243|But two groups refused to sign up.
p243_262|p243|There would be a north and south division.
p243_276|p243|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p243_289|p243|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p243_316|p243|A report on their property is due within days.
p243_302|p243|And does it?
p243_128|p243|We have to offer value for money.
p243_114|p243|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p243_100|p243|I am delighted to hear this news.
p243_198|p243|But they had to be paid for.
p243_167|p243|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p243_173|p243|If successful, several records will be made.
p243_359|p243|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p243_365|p243|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p243_371|p243|We have been going for three years.
p243_239|p243|Jim was down there with his wife.
p243_211|p243|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p243_205|p243|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p243_013|p243|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p243_007|p243|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p243_006|p243|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p243_012|p243|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p243_204|p243|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p243_210|p243|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p243_238|p243|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p243_370|p243|I have come here to show support for the families.
p243_364|p243|Both players gave so much to the side.
p243_358|p243|His style was direct and very human.
p243_172|p243|He said some things which were better left alone.
p243_166|p243|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p243_199|p243|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p243_158|p243|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p243_170|p243|That is a big risk at any price.
p243_164|p243|Surely it can't run for two years.
p243_372|p243|He really played us into a corner.
p243_366|p243|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p243_206|p243|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p243_212|p243|It is going to change the world.
p243_038|p243|He added that her comments were noted.
p243_004|p243|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p243_010|p243|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p243_011|p243|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p243_005|p243|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p243_039|p243|She will get through it I'm sure.
p243_213|p243|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p243_207|p243|I want an answer from the British Government.
p243_367|p243|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p243_373|p243|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p243_398|p243|People have a wish to charge twice.
p243_165|p243|But the game is still wide open.
p243_171|p243|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p243_159|p243|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p243_175|p243|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p243_161|p243|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p243_149|p243|Is it in the right place?
p243_388|p243|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p243_377|p243|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p243_363|p243|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p243_203|p243|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p243_217|p243|I do not see this so much as failure.
p243_001|p243|Please call Stella.  
p243_015|p243|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p243_029|p243|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p243_028|p243|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p243_014|p243|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p243_216|p243|I am not going to judge them.
p243_202|p243|I've never had a year like this.
p243_362|p243|He's young enough and he must learn.
p243_376|p243|It used to be all hard sell.
p243_389|p243|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p243_148|p243|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p243_160|p243|A progress report will be published in October.
p243_174|p243|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p243_189|p243|The story was not made public by this club.
p243_162|p243|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p243_176|p243|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p243_360|p243|They have the cash and the fire power.
p243_374|p243|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p243_348|p243|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p243_214|p243|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p243_200|p243|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p243_228|p243|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p243_016|p243|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p243_002|p243|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p243_003|p243|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p243_229|p243|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p243_201|p243|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p243_215|p243|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p243_349|p243|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p243_375|p243|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p243_361|p243|The institute board will take the decision.
p243_177|p243|It's just a different way of life.
p243_163|p243|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p243_188|p243|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p288_218|p288|We've got the bronze.
p288_026|p288|It is a disaster area.
p288_032|p288|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p288_191|p288|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p288_185|p288|If the director is with you.
p288_152|p288|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p288_146|p288|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p288_393|p288|It is not normal practice.
p288_387|p288|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p288_350|p288|That has been lost.
p288_344|p288|The boat was fantastic.
p288_378|p288|It is a large number.
p288_379|p288|I am a wealthy person.
p288_345|p288|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p288_351|p288|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p288_386|p288|There is a solution, she believes.
p288_392|p288|He is on the wrong side.
p288_147|p288|They were later discharged from hospital.
p288_153|p288|It has to be now.
p288_184|p288|People will ask about us.
p288_190|p288|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p288_033|p288|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p288_027|p288|Is this accurate?
p288_219|p288|Mental health is a massive issue.
p288_231|p288|It is set in Paris.
p288_225|p288|I'd never seen a play about me.
p288_233|p288|I haven't made the donation yet.
p288_227|p288|The track is currently covered in snow.
p288_031|p288|It is a case of taking a risk.
p288_025|p288|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p288_019|p288|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p288_186|p288|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p288_192|p288|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p288_145|p288|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p288_151|p288|I'm just enjoying every match.
p288_179|p288|It's a joke.
p288_384|p288|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p288_390|p288|It's like a basketball.
p288_347|p288|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p288_353|p288|It's good to start with Judith.
p288_409|p288|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p288_408|p288|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p288_352|p288|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p288_346|p288|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p288_391|p288|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p288_385|p288|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p288_178|p288|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p288_150|p288|It was so new, so exciting.
p288_144|p288|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p288_193|p288|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p288_187|p288|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p288_018|p288|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p288_024|p288|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p288_030|p288|I was an athlete.
p288_226|p288|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p288_232|p288|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p288_236|p288|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p288_222|p288|But it will be sorted out this week.
p288_008|p288|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p288_034|p288|It was fit for royalty.
p288_020|p288|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p288_183|p288|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p288_197|p288|They are in the euro.
p288_168|p288|They thought they had found a home.
p288_140|p288|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p288_154|p288|I was in the train station overnight.
p288_381|p288|I know I'm in a very special position.
p288_395|p288|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p288_342|p288|These days are long gone.
p288_356|p288|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p288_357|p288|He's very explosive.
p288_343|p288|He's been the key to everything.
p288_394|p288|This is a major step forward for carers.
p288_380|p288|Colour was at the core of his life.
p288_155|p288|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p288_141|p288|The weather forecast isn't good.
p288_169|p288|The jury is still out.
p288_196|p288|But we are not immune to the problem.
p288_182|p288|It is tough, but possible.
p288_021|p288|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p288_035|p288|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p288_009|p288|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p288_223|p288|It was good fun.
p288_237|p288|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p288_209|p288|It had all been arranged.
p288_221|p288|We played them off the pitch.
p288_235|p288|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p288_023|p288|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p288_037|p288|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p288_194|p288|The conference is the first test.
p288_180|p288|It just came into my head that day.
p288_157|p288|I have got a wife to feed.
p288_143|p288|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p288_396|p288|My house was shaking at the time.
p288_382|p288|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p288_369|p288|Who was the mystery MP?
p288_355|p288|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p288_341|p288|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p288_340|p288|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p288_354|p288|There is no room for error.
p288_368|p288|Not so, it seems.
p288_383|p288|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p288_397|p288|Emotions were complex.
p288_142|p288|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p288_156|p288|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p288_181|p288|They really did a great job.
p288_195|p288|Is that success?
p288_036|p288|President Bush is at war.
p288_022|p288|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p288_234|p288|And a film maker was born.
p288_220|p288|You have to do your research.
p288_208|p288|Twaddle is a case in point.
p288_284|p288|It's like a high school play.
p288_290|p288|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p288_247|p288|A friendship that will endure.
p288_253|p288|This is a big club.
p288_086|p288|By then, he was walking on water.
p288_092|p288|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p288_045|p288|He is too weak to move.
p288_051|p288|I was inspired by two things.
p288_079|p288|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p288_131|p288|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p288_125|p288|I had relied on him.
p288_119|p288|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p288_333|p288|Donald was his friend.
p288_327|p288|I came into this world with nothing.
p288_326|p288|There was some merit in that.
p288_332|p288|He was then replaced by Ross.
p288_118|p288|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p288_124|p288|Well, you can have a tree.
p288_130|p288|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p288_078|p288|This is the way things should be handled.
p288_050|p288|I guess I was lucky, though.
p288_044|p288|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p288_093|p288|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p288_087|p288|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p288_252|p288|It's a source of deep concern.
p288_246|p288|He's a lovely young man.
p288_291|p288|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p288_285|p288|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p288_293|p288|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p288_287|p288|The death toll included five children.
p288_250|p288|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p288_244|p288|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p288_278|p288|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p288_091|p288|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p288_085|p288|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p288_052|p288|Sadly, it can't.
p288_046|p288|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p288_126|p288|You've got to be vigilant.
p288_132|p288|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p288_324|p288|I had my suspicions.
p288_330|p288|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p288_318|p288|They wanted the club to make money.
p288_319|p288|Hartley should know.
p288_331|p288|We agreed to disagree.
p288_325|p288|However, the groups denied the claims.
p288_133|p288|Is that Titanic?
p288_127|p288|The goals were good.
p288_047|p288|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p288_053|p288|It's very odd.
p288_084|p288|We have other options.
p288_090|p288|It is a lifeline.
p288_279|p288|You've got to have both sides.
p288_245|p288|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p288_251|p288|I told you I was ill.
p288_286|p288|This is a national crisis.
p288_292|p288|Who can predict?
p288_296|p288|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p288_282|p288|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p288_269|p288|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p288_255|p288|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p288_241|p288|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p288_094|p288|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p288_080|p288|It's all going to clear the debt.
p288_057|p288|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p288_043|p288|But it might have done.
p288_123|p288|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p288_137|p288|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p288_309|p288|It's certainly different.
p288_321|p288|The home team had an amazing start.
p288_335|p288|She did not attend the courtroom.
p288_334|p288|I'd like to take the plunge.
p288_320|p288|Kids are terrible.
p288_308|p288|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p288_136|p288|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p288_122|p288|So the European elections are extremely important.
p288_042|p288|We need to chat.
p288_056|p288|That's the truth.
p288_081|p288|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p288_095|p288|Journalists should make him.
p288_240|p288|It's too much work.
p288_254|p288|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p288_268|p288|And Michael was just great.
p288_283|p288|Who will perform?
p288_297|p288|The home was now under new management.
p288_281|p288|The attacker died in the crash.
p288_295|p288|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p288_242|p288|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p288_256|p288|I was happily surprised.
p288_083|p288|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p288_097|p288|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p288_068|p288|That was the easy election.
p288_040|p288|But it took a lot of bottle.
p288_054|p288|It is unique.
p288_108|p288|The fire was above the hole.
p288_134|p288|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p288_120|p288|I'm so angry.
p288_336|p288|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p288_322|p288|My body is clearly capable.
p288_323|p288|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p288_337|p288|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p288_121|p288|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p288_135|p288|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p288_109|p288|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p288_055|p288|It will take time.
p288_041|p288|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p288_069|p288|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p288_096|p288|It was a good performance.
p288_082|p288|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p288_257|p288|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p288_243|p288|It is hard won.
p288_294|p288|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p288_280|p288|He will address the nation this evening.
p288_299|p288|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p288_266|p288|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p288_272|p288|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p288_064|p288|We should have known.
p288_070|p288|Neither it is.
p288_058|p288|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p288_110|p288|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p288_104|p288|It had been played at festivals.
p288_138|p288|He should have won.
p288_312|p288|He was solid.
p288_306|p288|It's just not funny!
p288_307|p288|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p288_313|p288|This is the culture change in medicine.
p288_139|p288|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p288_105|p288|We do not expect any surplus.
p288_111|p288|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p288_059|p288|Four other charges were dropped.
p288_071|p288|He seemed to lose his focus.
p288_065|p288|The end result is precisely the same.
p288_273|p288|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p288_267|p288|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p288_298|p288|I thought it was my only chance.
p288_271|p288|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p288_265|p288|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p288_259|p288|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p288_098|p288|I didn't play well last year.
p288_073|p288|It was chaotic.
p288_067|p288|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p288_107|p288|They were behind the wheel.
p288_113|p288|It is rubbish.
p288_305|p288|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p288_311|p288|We want to play at the worlds.
p288_339|p288|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p288_338|p288|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p288_310|p288|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p288_304|p288|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p288_112|p288|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p288_106|p288|It is so sad.
p288_066|p288|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p288_072|p288|It can be halted.
p288_099|p288|It was an adventure.
p288_258|p288|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p288_264|p288|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p288_270|p288|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p288_248|p288|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p288_274|p288|I am an estate agent.
p288_260|p288|Blood samples were taken.
p288_089|p288|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p288_076|p288|I've not thought about it.
p288_062|p288|Scotland had great assets.
p288_102|p288|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p288_116|p288|That's all right then.
p288_328|p288|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p288_300|p288|Nothing is safe.
p288_314|p288|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p288_315|p288|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p288_301|p288|One was a lawyer.
p288_329|p288|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p288_117|p288|There were no grounds for his action.
p288_103|p288|It's in his blood.
p288_063|p288|Equity declined to comment.
p288_077|p288|People must remain vigilant.
p288_088|p288|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p288_261|p288|We shall rely on human beings.
p288_275|p288|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p288_249|p288|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p288_288|p288|Who did the recruiting?
p288_263|p288|It looks as though he will be right.
p288_277|p288|But I've won both ways.
p288_049|p288|I was lost.
p288_061|p288|They're appalled by that.
p288_075|p288|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p288_129|p288|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p288_115|p288|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p288_101|p288|I'm not depressed.
p288_317|p288|My whole life has changed.
p288_303|p288|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p288_302|p288|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p288_316|p288|I never thought it would take this long.
p288_100|p288|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p288_114|p288|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p288_128|p288|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p288_074|p288|Is there a new way forward?
p288_060|p288|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p288_048|p288|It will come all right.
p288_276|p288|It happens from time to time.
p288_262|p288|This is a question of Islam.
p288_289|p288|So I did.
p288_205|p288|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p288_211|p288|In each case they were a goal down.
p288_239|p288|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p288_007|p288|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p288_013|p288|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p288_198|p288|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p288_173|p288|Tony had arrived.
p288_167|p288|He was a crazy man.
p288_371|p288|The play is based on a real-life event.
p288_403|p288|What would be the point?
p288_365|p288|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p288_359|p288|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p288_358|p288|We have to move forward.
p288_402|p288|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
p288_364|p288|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p288_370|p288|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p288_166|p288|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p288_172|p288|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p288_199|p288|But she might be.
p288_012|p288|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p288_006|p288|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p288_238|p288|He's got to go.
p288_210|p288|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p288_204|p288|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p288_212|p288|I was so nervous.
p288_206|p288|Feel the heat?
p288_010|p288|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p288_004|p288|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p288_038|p288|I was scared.
p288_164|p288|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p288_170|p288|It's quite a routine.
p288_158|p288|It is not too late to get on board.
p288_399|p288|He's already made history.
p288_366|p288|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p288_400|p288|Then , he laughs.
p288_372|p288|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p288_373|p288|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p288_367|p288|I am a star.
p288_401|p288|You ask the question.
p288_398|p288|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p288_159|p288|They will do their own thing.
p288_171|p288|It should be easy.
p288_165|p288|Nobody did in those days.
p288_039|p288|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p288_005|p288|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p288_011|p288|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p288_207|p288|She should not be blamed.
p288_213|p288|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p288_217|p288|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p288_203|p288|Now, it's all right.
p288_029|p288|Because we do not need it.
p288_015|p288|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p288_001|p288|Please call Stella.  
p288_149|p288|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p288_161|p288|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p288_175|p288|There is no point in looking any further.
p288_388|p288|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p288_405|p288|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p288_363|p288|So I left.
p288_377|p288|It was a funny game.
p288_411|p288|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p288_376|p288|They play together perfectly.
p288_410|p288|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p288_404|p288|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p288_362|p288|That would help.
p288_389|p288|It's just outrageous.
p288_174|p288|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p288_160|p288|Does that put pressure on us?
p288_148|p288|This latter point is hugely important.
p288_014|p288|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p288_028|p288|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p288_202|p288|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p288_216|p288|Who was on the panel?
p288_228|p288|The body follows the mind.
p288_200|p288|It's all about money, money, money.
p288_214|p288|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p288_002|p288|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p288_016|p288|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p288_189|p288|Peace was won.
p288_176|p288|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p288_162|p288|It is too much for me.
p288_348|p288|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p288_412|p288|That may be.
p288_374|p288|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p288_360|p288|However, it was well worth the wait.
p288_406|p288|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p288_361|p288|Our numbers are small.
p288_407|p288|The real enemy is in your own back yard.
p288_375|p288|We do not get that impression now.
p288_349|p288|You need a licence to run a pub.
p288_163|p288|It is a terrible place.
p288_177|p288|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p288_188|p288|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p288_017|p288|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p288_003|p288|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p288_215|p288|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p288_201|p288|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p288_229|p288|However, no further action was taken by police.
p281_151|p281|The family kept away from me.
p281_145|p281|The FBI could become involved.
p281_179|p281|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p281_390|p281|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p281_384|p281|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p281_435|p281|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p281_353|p281|I think this proposal is excellent.
p281_347|p281|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
p281_421|p281|Footballers have also been targeted.
p281_409|p281|Yet the data is compelling.
p281_227|p281|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p281_233|p281|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p281_025|p281|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p281_031|p281|I'd just like to play.
p281_019|p281|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p281_018|p281|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p281_030|p281|They've got their own agenda.
p281_024|p281|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p281_232|p281|I am considered a teenager.
p281_226|p281|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p281_408|p281|There is a solution, she believes.
p281_346|p281|It was almost too much.
p281_420|p281|I am delighted for them.
p281_434|p281|We might be back next year.
p281_352|p281|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p281_385|p281|He has been a success this year.
p281_391|p281|I was as strong as a horse.
p281_178|p281|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p281_144|p281|I was caught out a little bit.
p281_150|p281|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p281_187|p281|Says the Duke of York.
p281_193|p281|They were seriously after him.
p281_185|p281|The referee had a good game.
p281_191|p281|I have accepted the challenge.
p281_146|p281|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p281_152|p281|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p281_387|p281|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p281_393|p281|Are they free?
p281_422|p281|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p281_344|p281|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p281_350|p281|He did a good job.
p281_436|p281|Size is not the issue.
p281_378|p281|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p281_230|p281|It had all been arranged.
p281_224|p281|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p281_218|p281|You are a great player.
p281_032|p281|Our fans have been marvellous.
p281_026|p281|They are very clever in their use of words.
p281_027|p281|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p281_033|p281|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p281_219|p281|What do we want to do that for?
p281_225|p281|We're very unhappy about it.
p281_231|p281|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p281_379|p281|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p281_351|p281|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p281_437|p281|It was support as it should be.
p281_423|p281|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p281_345|p281|I have a moral dilemma.
p281_392|p281|I had a fortunate war.
p281_386|p281|In fact, he was great today.
p281_153|p281|My Dad is a hero.
p281_147|p281|Three hours later, the man was free.
p281_190|p281|He prefers to play for them.
p281_184|p281|They know no other way.
p281_180|p281|It is not either national standards or local control.
p281_194|p281|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p281_143|p281|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p281_157|p281|Had I heard?
p281_382|p281|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p281_396|p281|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p281_369|p281|She said they would appeal.
p281_341|p281|It's just the way I play.
p281_427|p281|It was a poor performance.
p281_433|p281|It is an absolute nonsense.
p281_355|p281|He deserves a top team.
p281_209|p281|We believe a third party was involved.
p281_235|p281|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p281_221|p281|how do you get it back?
p281_037|p281|It carried a double message.
p281_023|p281|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p281_022|p281|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p281_036|p281|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p281_220|p281|Does the name matter?
p281_234|p281|This will secure the future of our industry.
p281_208|p281|They have the cash and the fire power.
p281_432|p281|He will be judged by his actions.
p281_354|p281|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p281_340|p281|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p281_426|p281|The professor is in no doubt.
p281_368|p281|The major championships will always have a special place.
p281_397|p281|That investment has now been secured.
p281_383|p281|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p281_156|p281|Are you from the rugby?
p281_142|p281|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p281_195|p281|And this game is all about belief.
p281_181|p281|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p281_197|p281|That would be my view.
p281_183|p281|I can't even get into the A team.
p281_168|p281|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p281_154|p281|So what is the campaign about?
p281_140|p281|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p281_395|p281|Is there a waiting list?
p281_381|p281|He has seen the past.
p281_418|p281|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p281_356|p281|It is all about having physical evidence.
p281_430|p281|Once again, they would be wrong.
p281_424|p281|My aim is a top six finish.
p281_342|p281|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p281_222|p281|What are you not good at?
p281_236|p281|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p281_008|p281|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p281_020|p281|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p281_034|p281|He should emerge as the winner.
p281_035|p281|She failed in her action.
p281_021|p281|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p281_009|p281|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p281_237|p281|It was a crazy day.
p281_223|p281|You have got to look at speed of response.
p281_425|p281|That's the way it works.
p281_343|p281|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p281_357|p281|It should be a great game, though.
p281_431|p281|Together, we can make a difference.
p281_419|p281|After the match, do you?
p281_380|p281|I wanted to go out on a high.
p281_394|p281|What are they for?
p281_141|p281|It is not just about pay.
p281_155|p281|And does it?
p281_169|p281|Our position remains the same.
p281_182|p281|The hotel was now for sale.
p281_196|p281|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p281_132|p281|He wants to win a major.
p281_126|p281|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p281_330|p281|It's difficult to predict the future.
p281_456|p281|We could hardly believe it.
p281_442|p281|It is pretty bad news.
p281_324|p281|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p281_318|p281|That meant the search was unlawful.
p281_287|p281|What was the matter for concern?
p281_293|p281|You have to expect this type of thing.
p281_244|p281|Wilson will tell the truth.
p281_250|p281|That is still in place.
p281_278|p281|For him then it's a labour of love.
p281_085|p281|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p281_091|p281|We could not get any possession.
p281_046|p281|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p281_052|p281|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p281_053|p281|I must take a seat.
p281_047|p281|He looks like an Afghan.
p281_090|p281|It was worth a photograph.
p281_084|p281|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p281_279|p281|We are aiming for early March.
p281_251|p281|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p281_245|p281|She died in middle age.
p281_292|p281|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p281_286|p281|was everything done to save people?
p281_319|p281|This may be perfectly innocent.
p281_443|p281|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p281_325|p281|It is all credit to them today.
p281_331|p281|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p281_457|p281|The men are very worried.
p281_127|p281|Twaddle is a case in point.
p281_133|p281|First meeting was next week.
p281_125|p281|She does not want to speak.
p281_131|p281|She was also very brave.
p281_119|p281|They've got to account for it.
p281_327|p281|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p281_441|p281|He deserves a second chance.
p281_455|p281|She has now been registered as disabled.
p281_333|p281|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p281_290|p281|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p281_284|p281|That view has not altered.
p281_253|p281|The pig industry is on its knees.
p281_247|p281|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p281_092|p281|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p281_086|p281|The error appeared in a warrant.
p281_051|p281|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p281_045|p281|Among them are many criminals.
p281_079|p281|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p281_078|p281|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p281_044|p281|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p281_050|p281|I had come back from London.
p281_087|p281|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p281_093|p281|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p281_246|p281|We just had a go.
p281_252|p281|The irony was not lost.
p281_285|p281|And they were being paid?
p281_291|p281|He was also married with two children.
p281_454|p281|This is the stuff of live music.
p281_332|p281|But the Farmer is bemused.
p281_326|p281|The whole family was in shock.
p281_440|p281|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p281_118|p281|It is much as it has been described.
p281_130|p281|There were no serious injuries.
p281_124|p281|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p281_108|p281|Why do it otherwise?
p281_120|p281|Then again, we could have.
p281_134|p281|I never wanted a legal battle.
p281_444|p281|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p281_322|p281|The letters are going out today.
p281_336|p281|There was no time scale.
p281_450|p281|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p281_295|p281|We have to be very, very careful.
p281_281|p281|The demand is created by the supply.
p281_256|p281|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p281_242|p281|After that nothing could save him.
p281_097|p281|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p281_083|p281|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p281_068|p281|I have proved that in the past.
p281_054|p281|That is very hard, alone.
p281_040|p281|They want to be entertained.
p281_041|p281|A week is a long time in politics.
p281_055|p281|The Government should be ashamed.
p281_069|p281|He had been a singer.
p281_082|p281|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p281_096|p281|But I know the course.
p281_243|p281|This is the year of the Tiger.
p281_257|p281|She took them for a term.
p281_280|p281|It is also very valuable.
p281_294|p281|They seem to get away with it.
p281_337|p281|Does that put pressure on us?
p281_451|p281|We have the location, which is assured.
p281_445|p281|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p281_323|p281|I can see their argument.
p281_135|p281|We will try to find someone.
p281_121|p281|We have a training class.
p281_109|p281|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p281_137|p281|We have seen a copy of the report.
p281_123|p281|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p281_309|p281|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p281_453|p281|We're all paying for it.
p281_335|p281|The airport was even different.
p281_321|p281|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p281_447|p281|I was embarrassed by it.
p281_282|p281|Not many companies can say that these days.
p281_296|p281|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p281_269|p281|The capital costs are modest.
p281_241|p281|We played them off the pitch.
p281_255|p281|The minister is the engineer.
p281_080|p281|He is in the queue.
p281_094|p281|The conclusion is the same.
p281_043|p281|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p281_057|p281|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p281_056|p281|None has ever been found.
p281_042|p281|I am just going to go for it.
p281_095|p281|It is a vicious circle.
p281_081|p281|I first met him last summer.
p281_254|p281|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p281_240|p281|You could feel the heat.
p281_268|p281|That would depend on the parole board.
p281_297|p281|It is a symbolic concert.
p281_283|p281|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p281_320|p281|Scotland has shown the way.
p281_446|p281|But we have built a platform for next season.
p281_452|p281|They were good years for him.
p281_334|p281|However, the groups denied the claims.
p281_308|p281|The real issue is personal.
p281_122|p281|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p281_136|p281|People come from all round the world to see it.
p281_113|p281|Or it would have been.
p281_107|p281|What do we do?
p281_311|p281|He was at home with his pals.
p281_305|p281|There should be room for creative dissent.
p281_339|p281|Do you think we are a top nation?
p281_265|p281|I should think so, too.
p281_271|p281|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p281_259|p281|You can never tell with the manager.
p281_098|p281|We live by the rule of law.
p281_067|p281|It is a real problem.
p281_073|p281|Do I have a favourite?
p281_072|p281|So is that it, then?
p281_066|p281|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p281_099|p281|This is a national crisis.
p281_258|p281|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p281_270|p281|That could be in place by next year.
p281_264|p281|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p281_338|p281|Did it work?
p281_304|p281|We are not doing the Today programme.
p281_310|p281|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p281_106|p281|It was a funny game.
p281_112|p281|The whole thing is the music.
p281_104|p281|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p281_110|p281|That is the only way forward.
p281_138|p281|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p281_306|p281|These figures are truly awful.
p281_460|p281|It must never be seen as second class.
p281_312|p281|The dealer is on notice.
p281_448|p281|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p281_299|p281|This is the correct decision.
p281_272|p281|He looked like a schoolboy.
p281_266|p281|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p281_070|p281|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p281_064|p281|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p281_058|p281|We should be able to cope.
p281_059|p281|It was a lovely experience.
p281_065|p281|Only water is currently allowed.
p281_071|p281|How are you, sir?
p281_267|p281|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p281_273|p281|England could only play the other team on the park.
p281_298|p281|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p281_449|p281|She came to the Highland Show.
p281_313|p281|The party lasted all night.
p281_307|p281|We need to increase the membership.
p281_139|p281|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p281_111|p281|They are at a very early stage.
p281_105|p281|It's not a lack of confidence.
p281_129|p281|They made such decisions in London.
p281_101|p281|The following are the principal provisions.
p281_115|p281|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p281_459|p281|We are going through the process.
p281_303|p281|The rescue package is public money.
p281_317|p281|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p281_288|p281|Do I think about them often?
p281_277|p281|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p281_263|p281|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p281_049|p281|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p281_075|p281|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p281_061|p281|We will pay their bills.
p281_060|p281|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p281_074|p281|The players will be down.
p281_048|p281|That was the theory, anyway.
p281_262|p281|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p281_276|p281|We feel very good about it.
p281_289|p281|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p281_316|p281|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p281_302|p281|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p281_458|p281|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p281_114|p281|His is a success story by any standard.
p281_100|p281|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p281_128|p281|That is far too high.
p281_116|p281|Such actions are rarely popular.
p281_102|p281|Movement has to take place.
p281_328|p281|The actor has met with Mandela.
p281_314|p281|We are in the end game.
p281_300|p281|He added that the business was in good shape.
p281_248|p281|It is set in Paris.
p281_260|p281|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p281_274|p281|He took over our lives.
p281_089|p281|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p281_062|p281|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p281_076|p281|There could be a lot of confusion.
p281_077|p281|He also received a medal of honour.
p281_063|p281|The standard is extremely high.
p281_088|p281|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p281_275|p281|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p281_261|p281|Persuaded to change his mind.
p281_249|p281|He has run a hell of a race.
p281_301|p281|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p281_315|p281|They come to enjoy themselves.
p281_329|p281|There is no shortage of farmers.
p281_103|p281|City sentiment is in his favour.
p281_117|p281|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p281_170|p281|It's nice to be nice.
p281_164|p281|I have got a wife to feed.
p281_158|p281|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p281_399|p281|It is hard to understand.
p281_414|p281|We will stand for the nation.
p281_372|p281|It's as wide as a church in here.
p281_366|p281|There will be no final dividend.
p281_400|p281|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p281_428|p281|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p281_206|p281|No details of the talks were given.
p281_212|p281|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p281_004|p281|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p281_010|p281|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p281_038|p281|It is a financial matter.
p281_039|p281|This film will be totally awesome.
p281_011|p281|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p281_005|p281|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p281_213|p281|This is a holy place.
p281_207|p281|This will be our new beginning.
p281_429|p281|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p281_367|p281|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p281_401|p281|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p281_415|p281|Is it worth it?
p281_373|p281|The shares are a strong hold.
p281_398|p281|He had returned to die.
p281_159|p281|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p281_165|p281|We have a budget in March.
p281_171|p281|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p281_198|p281|It decided to blame the media.
p281_167|p281|They will do their own thing.
p281_173|p281|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p281_403|p281|The casualties were not named.
p281_365|p281|I got a yellow card.
p281_371|p281|There is no deal as yet.
p281_417|p281|How do you take them away?
p281_359|p281|He had no previous convictions.
p281_211|p281|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p281_205|p281|It was a test in itself.
p281_239|p281|That has been the easy part.
p281_013|p281|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p281_007|p281|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p281_006|p281|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p281_012|p281|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p281_238|p281|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p281_204|p281|There was no way back for United after that.
p281_210|p281|Tommy is not a problem.
p281_358|p281|I said she was very young.
p281_370|p281|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p281_416|p281|Does it matter?
p281_402|p281|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p281_364|p281|You need a licence to run a pub.
p281_172|p281|They could not match it.
p281_166|p281|The pension levels will remain the same.
p281_199|p281|We always felt we could win.
p281_189|p281|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p281_162|p281|It is a terrible tragedy.
p281_176|p281|You've got to be vigilant.
p281_348|p281|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p281_360|p281|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p281_406|p281|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p281_412|p281|That is a personal matter.
p281_374|p281|It would be quite nice.
p281_228|p281|I had relied on him.
p281_214|p281|He had suffered a heart attack.
p281_200|p281|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p281_016|p281|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p281_002|p281|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p281_003|p281|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p281_017|p281|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p281_201|p281|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p281_215|p281|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p281_229|p281|I'm just a regular person.
p281_413|p281|He seems to be used to the attention.
p281_375|p281|There was a thing in front of the camera.
p281_361|p281|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p281_407|p281|It was the same expression of joy.
p281_349|p281|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p281_177|p281|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p281_163|p281|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
p281_188|p281|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p281_149|p281|It is not normal practice.
p281_175|p281|One season, they might do well.
p281_161|p281|The strong pound also took its toll.
p281_388|p281|A review is under way.
p281_439|p281|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p281_377|p281|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p281_411|p281|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p281_405|p281|It had been on the cards.
p281_363|p281|They should take their mobile phones.
p281_203|p281|Because he was born in England.
p281_217|p281|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p281_029|p281|It's not going to work out that way.
p281_015|p281|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p281_014|p281|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p281_028|p281|Smoking is also very important.
p281_216|p281|You have caught a serial killer.
p281_202|p281|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p281_404|p281|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p281_362|p281|Neither woman has been named.
p281_376|p281|The pair are very much in love.
p281_410|p281|That was a touch of class.
p281_438|p281|I didn't get to keep it.
p281_389|p281|It is a simple equation.
p281_160|p281|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p281_174|p281|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p281_148|p281|We have a clean bill of health.
p275_150|p275|We have the location, which is assured.
p275_144|p275|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p275_178|p275|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p275_391|p275|It was a breathtaking moment.
p275_385|p275|It can help.
p275_352|p275|The pair are very much in love.
p275_346|p275|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p275_420|p275|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p275_408|p275|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p275_226|p275|I will win.
p275_024|p275|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p275_030|p275|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p275_018|p275|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p275_019|p275|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p275_031|p275|There's a story, too.
p275_025|p275|But it failed.
p275_233|p275|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p275_227|p275|The report is due out next month.
p275_409|p275|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p275_347|p275|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p275_421|p275|I know the worry over Iraq.
p275_353|p275|It is not like us.
p275_384|p275|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p275_390|p275|That set the tone.
p275_179|p275|It is not either national standards or local control.
p275_145|p275|Who would be right?
p275_151|p275|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p275_186|p275|It's an idea.
p275_192|p275|It is a farce.
p275_184|p275|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p275_190|p275|What has caused the demise of singing?
p275_147|p275|He realises his mistake.
p275_153|p275|I am just trying to do my job.
p275_386|p275|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
p275_392|p275|What happened in the summer?
p275_423|p275|It's been a long, long journey.
p275_345|p275|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p275_351|p275|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p275_379|p275|It looked like a river.
p275_231|p275|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p275_225|p275|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p275_219|p275|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p275_033|p275|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p275_027|p275|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p275_026|p275|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p275_032|p275|He was jailed for four years.
p275_218|p275|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p275_224|p275|It's the Tate.
p275_230|p275|My wife and family are the support system.
p275_378|p275|It is the old story.
p275_350|p275|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p275_422|p275|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p275_344|p275|There may be reasons for it.
p275_393|p275|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p275_387|p275|They are good.
p275_152|p275|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p275_146|p275|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p275_191|p275|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p275_185|p275|His name was unknown.
p275_181|p275|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p275_195|p275|Yet the data is compelling.
p275_142|p275|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p275_156|p275|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p275_383|p275|It's like a basketball.
p275_397|p275|He will be judged by his actions.
p275_368|p275|There is no signature.
p275_340|p275|This is a friendly match?
p275_426|p275|I want a career.
p275_354|p275|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p275_208|p275|Feel the heat?
p275_234|p275|Of course I was tempted.
p275_220|p275|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p275_036|p275|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p275_022|p275|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p275_023|p275|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p275_037|p275|They're just different.
p275_221|p275|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p275_235|p275|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p275_209|p275|He knows a lot.
p275_355|p275|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p275_341|p275|I got a yellow card.
p275_427|p275|He deserved a red card.
p275_369|p275|I am a wealthy person.
p275_396|p275|What was the difference between them?
p275_382|p275|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p275_157|p275|The weather forecast isn't good.
p275_143|p275|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p275_194|p275|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p275_180|p275|He deserved the win.
p275_196|p275|I came home by ambulance.
p275_182|p275|Tony had arrived.
p275_169|p275|We've all had the shots.
p275_155|p275|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p275_141|p275|Is that it?
p275_394|p275|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p275_380|p275|It's a real problem.
p275_419|p275|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p275_357|p275|That would help.
p275_425|p275|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p275_343|p275|Tell us about it.
p275_223|p275|Saturday is gone.
p275_237|p275|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p275_009|p275|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p275_035|p275|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p275_034|p275|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p275_020|p275|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p275_008|p275|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p275_236|p275|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p275_222|p275|We could easily be cut again.
p275_424|p275|We are now up against it.
p275_342|p275|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p275_356|p275|We will be homeless.
p275_418|p275|We have to expand.
p275_381|p275|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p275_395|p275|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p275_140|p275|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p275_154|p275|So I got a blood test.
p275_168|p275|I was in the train station overnight.
p275_183|p275|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p275_197|p275|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p275_133|p275|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p275_127|p275|It is not a U-turn.
p275_331|p275|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p275_325|p275|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p275_286|p275|Who did the recruiting?
p275_292|p275|There was a vacuum.
p275_251|p275|Kirkwood was arrested.
p275_279|p275|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p275_084|p275|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p275_090|p275|But I was wrong.
p275_047|p275|Among them are many criminals.
p275_053|p275|It is unique.
p275_052|p275|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p275_046|p275|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p275_091|p275|I saw the whole thing.
p275_085|p275|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p275_278|p275|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p275_250|p275|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p275_244|p275|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p275_293|p275|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p275_287|p275|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p275_324|p275|My view has now completely changed.
p275_330|p275|It's been hard.
p275_126|p275|She really suffered for her art.
p275_132|p275|I am now unemployed.
p275_124|p275|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
p275_130|p275|Twaddle is a case in point.
p275_118|p275|It is rubbish.
p275_326|p275|Is that an issue?
p275_332|p275|Who will do it?
p275_291|p275|Who can predict?
p275_285|p275|It was good.
p275_252|p275|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p275_246|p275|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p275_093|p275|Hartley should know.
p275_087|p275|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p275_050|p275|Here's a clue.
p275_044|p275|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p275_078|p275|A review is under way.
p275_079|p275|He had suffered a heart attack.
p275_045|p275|This represents a tough game for us.
p275_051|p275|I had come back from London.
p275_086|p275|It is a lifeline.
p275_092|p275|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p275_247|p275|It was a hit.
p275_253|p275|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p275_284|p275|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p275_290|p275|I could never be cool.
p275_333|p275|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p275_327|p275|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p275_119|p275|Who would be a referee?
p275_131|p275|The BBC was a disgrace.
p275_125|p275|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p275_109|p275|It's a shame.
p275_121|p275|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p275_135|p275|What will happen then?
p275_323|p275|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p275_337|p275|We are the gateway to justice.
p275_294|p275|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p275_280|p275|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p275_257|p275|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p275_243|p275|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p275_096|p275|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p275_082|p275|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p275_069|p275|He was at home with his pals.
p275_055|p275|There's a danger.
p275_041|p275|Dancing was her life.
p275_040|p275|Sadly, it can't.
p275_054|p275|That's the truth.
p275_068|p275|Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
p275_083|p275|They lived for their children.
p275_097|p275|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p275_242|p275|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p275_256|p275|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p275_281|p275|You've got to have both sides.
p275_295|p275|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p275_336|p275|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p275_322|p275|Off with their heads.
p275_134|p275|It plans to return to this field.
p275_120|p275|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p275_108|p275|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p275_136|p275|It's not true.
p275_122|p275|Who would have?
p275_308|p275|You should be.
p275_334|p275|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p275_320|p275|We are in the end game.
p275_283|p275|Yet, it worked.
p275_297|p275|One was a lawyer.
p275_268|p275|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p275_240|p275|It is hard won.
p275_254|p275|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p275_081|p275|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p275_095|p275|May not have been at fault?
p275_042|p275|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p275_056|p275|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p275_057|p275|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p275_043|p275|We will push.
p275_094|p275|It is a love affair.
p275_080|p275|He is driven.
p275_255|p275|Is that a serious question?
p275_241|p275|Our policy is clear.
p275_269|p275|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p275_296|p275|She is really magic.
p275_282|p275|It was a virus.
p275_321|p275|Our message was inclusive.
p275_335|p275|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
p275_309|p275|The minister is the engineer.
p275_123|p275|That's all right then.
p275_137|p275|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p275_112|p275|It is so sad.
p275_106|p275|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p275_310|p275|The letters are going out today.
p275_304|p275|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p275_338|p275|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p275_264|p275|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p275_270|p275|It was very fast.
p275_258|p275|Souter will be back.
p275_099|p275|Oil embargo endorsed.
p275_066|p275|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p275_072|p275|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p275_073|p275|It works for us.
p275_067|p275|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p275_098|p275|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p275_259|p275|Blood samples were taken.
p275_271|p275|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p275_265|p275|It's very nice.
p275_339|p275|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
p275_305|p275|The plot is minimal.
p275_311|p275|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p275_113|p275|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p275_105|p275|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p275_111|p275|It is a financial matter.
p275_139|p275|It was very frightened and dirty.
p275_307|p275|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p275_313|p275|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p275_298|p275|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p275_273|p275|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p275_071|p275|There could be a way back.
p275_065|p275|Try to save us.
p275_059|p275|This is the first step.
p275_058|p275|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p275_064|p275|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p275_070|p275|It's all I can do.
p275_266|p275|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p275_272|p275|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p275_299|p275|There were no passengers on board.
p275_312|p275|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p275_306|p275|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p275_138|p275|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p275_110|p275|It was the eighties.
p275_104|p275|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p275_128|p275|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p275_100|p275|There were no grounds for his action.
p275_114|p275|The mood is upbeat.
p275_302|p275|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p275_316|p275|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p275_289|p275|We are not going to forget.
p275_276|p275|We are a grandmother.
p275_262|p275|This is a question of Islam.
p275_048|p275|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p275_074|p275|The party is up for it.
p275_060|p275|It's good news and long overdue.
p275_061|p275|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p275_075|p275|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p275_049|p275|He looks like an Afghan.
p275_263|p275|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
p275_277|p275|He looked very sharp.
p275_288|p275|Bombing slaughter rejected
p275_317|p275|Kids are terrible.
p275_303|p275|The court had a number of empty seats.
p275_115|p275|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p275_101|p275|He takes the job.
p275_129|p275|Who will attend?
p275_117|p275|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p275_103|p275|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
p275_329|p275|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p275_315|p275|My whole life has changed.
p275_301|p275|This is a war over our home.
p275_249|p275|I can't get a job.
p275_261|p275|It will be done in stages.
p275_275|p275|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p275_088|p275|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p275_063|p275|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p275_077|p275|I will miss him.
p275_076|p275|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p275_062|p275|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p275_089|p275|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p275_274|p275|It's so awful.
p275_260|p275|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p275_248|p275|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p275_300|p275|It could work.
p275_314|p275|We have got to get the points from this one.
p275_328|p275|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p275_102|p275|She reflects a bit.
p275_116|p275|It's not fair.
p275_171|p275|Seven people were later detained by police.
p275_165|p275|Well, he should know.
p275_159|p275|They have not been named.
p275_398|p275|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p275_415|p275|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p275_373|p275|Something is wrong.
p275_367|p275|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p275_429|p275|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p275_207|p275|I don't want to use it.
p275_213|p275|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p275_011|p275|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p275_039|p275|Indeed, he does.
p275_038|p275|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p275_010|p275|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p275_004|p275|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p275_212|p275|It had all been arranged.
p275_428|p275|And they replied.
p275_366|p275|They have not done so this season so far.
p275_400|p275|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p275_414|p275|Paris is not only young.
p275_372|p275|It is hard to understand.
p275_399|p275|It is an absolute nonsense.
p275_158|p275|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p275_164|p275|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p275_170|p275|Tell it like it was?
p275_199|p275|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p275_166|p275|Was this element always there?
p275_172|p275|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p275_402|p275|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p275_364|p275|It's now down in black and white.
p275_370|p275|Colour was at the core of his life.
p275_416|p275|He is to appeal.
p275_358|p275|It is a memorial.
p275_210|p275|You have a plan?
p275_238|p275|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p275_012|p275|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. 
p275_006|p275|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p275_007|p275|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p275_013|p275|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p275_239|p275|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p275_205|p275|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
p275_211|p275|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p275_359|p275|This is a club on the rise.
p275_371|p275|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p275_417|p275|It all began as an accident.
p275_403|p275|It might be.
p275_365|p275|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p275_173|p275|You had to go and see him.
p275_167|p275|These days are long gone.
p275_198|p275|I have a cold.
p275_188|p275|Four policemen were wounded.
p275_163|p275|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p275_177|p275|As we worked.
p275_349|p275|She is free.
p275_361|p275|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p275_407|p275|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p275_413|p275|I am extremely cautious.
p275_375|p275|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p275_229|p275|He is in the queue.
p275_215|p275|He seemed to lose his focus.
p275_201|p275|Who will pay for this?
p275_017|p275|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p275_003|p275|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p275_002|p275|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p275_016|p275|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p275_200|p275|Tommy is not a problem.
p275_214|p275|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p275_228|p275|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p275_374|p275|You can cope with it.
p275_360|p275|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p275_406|p275|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p275_348|p275|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p275_176|p275|Is Saddam a threat?
p275_162|p275|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p275_189|p275|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p275_148|p275|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p275_174|p275|In a way he was.
p275_160|p275|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p275_389|p275|But we are a young side.
p275_376|p275|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p275_410|p275|We went straight into the bedroom.
p275_404|p275|Feel the air, the space.
p275_362|p275|The death rates are still as high.
p275_216|p275|Work has started.
p275_028|p275|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p275_014|p275|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p275_015|p275|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p275_001|p275|Please call Stella.  
p275_029|p275|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p275_217|p275|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p275_203|p275|But she might be.
p275_405|p275|He scored a touchdown.
p275_363|p275|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
p275_377|p275|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p275_411|p275|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p275_388|p275|I'm glad I came.
p275_161|p275|It was by the numbers.
p275_175|p275|One season, they might do well.
p275_149|p275|I was awful.
p272_110|p272|You should be.
p272_104|p272|I love the Dome.
p272_138|p272|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p272_064|p272|That's the truth.
p272_070|p272|They are real.
p272_058|p272|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p272_266|p272|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p272_272|p272|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p272_299|p272|You are the glory.
p272_298|p272|The plot is minimal.
p272_273|p272|He looked very sharp.
p272_267|p272|It was very fast.
p272_059|p272|Here's a clue.
p272_071|p272|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p272_065|p272|They are ready.
p272_139|p272|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p272_105|p272|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p272_111|p272|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p272_307|p272|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p272_313|p272|I came into this world with nothing.
p272_305|p272|We are a peaceful people.
p272_311|p272|A review is under way.
p272_339|p272|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p272_107|p272|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p272_113|p272|He takes the job.
p272_073|p272|He was popular.
p272_067|p272|I feel I did not have enough time.
p272_098|p272|Today I couldn't run on it.
p272_271|p272|If not, he should go home.
p272_265|p272|It's a way of life.
p272_259|p272|It's very nice.
p272_258|p272|Immediate action must be taken.
p272_264|p272|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p272_270|p272|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p272_099|p272|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p272_066|p272|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p272_072|p272|That was a gold medal for certain.
p272_112|p272|Two of the team became ill.
p272_106|p272|Our position remains unchanged.
p272_338|p272|Tell us about it.
p272_310|p272|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p272_304|p272|My whole life has changed.
p272_328|p272|I've got no secret.
p272_300|p272|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p272_314|p272|It's too horrible to think.
p272_102|p272|It is annoying.
p272_116|p272|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p272_076|p272|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p272_062|p272|There was no safety net.
p272_089|p272|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p272_248|p272|Is that a serious question?
p272_274|p272|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p272_260|p272|He was also married with two children.
p272_261|p272|The system can work.
p272_275|p272|All options are open.
p272_249|p272|This is the first step.
p272_088|p272|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p272_063|p272|It is unique.
p272_077|p272|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p272_117|p272|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p272_103|p272|But I was wrong.
p272_315|p272|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p272_301|p272|The letters are going out today.
p272_329|p272|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p272_317|p272|Is there a new way forward?
p272_303|p272|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p272_129|p272|She really suffered for her art.
p272_115|p272|I am just trying to do my job.
p272_101|p272|It was clear.
p272_049|p272|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p272_061|p272|Next league matches Celtic.
p272_075|p272|There was an e-mail.
p272_263|p272|We're in shock.
p272_277|p272|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p272_288|p272|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p272_289|p272|I was the sheep.
p272_276|p272|Dialogue is the key.
p272_262|p272|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p272_074|p272|But I've won both ways.
p272_060|p272|It had been in place since last July.
p272_048|p272|We will push.
p272_100|p272|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p272_114|p272|She reflects a bit.
p272_128|p272|I'm so angry.
p272_302|p272|We want to play at the worlds.
p272_316|p272|Off with their heads.
p272_371|p272|I am a wealthy person.
p272_403|p272|Then , he laughs.
p272_365|p272|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p272_359|p272|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p272_173|p272|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p272_167|p272|It is not like us.
p272_198|p272|They make a selective perception process.
p272_007|p272|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p272_013|p272|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p272_205|p272|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p272_211|p272|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p272_239|p272|I should think so, too.
p272_238|p272|There wasn't a goal.
p272_210|p272|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p272_204|p272|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p272_012|p272|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p272_006|p272|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p272_199|p272|We have an election in eight days.
p272_166|p272|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p272_172|p272|Does that put pressure on us?
p272_358|p272|It's now down in black and white.
p272_402|p272|Emotions were complex.
p272_364|p272|So there, we won.
p272_370|p272|I've never seen a game like it.
p272_366|p272|There is no signature.
p272_400|p272|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p272_372|p272|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p272_399|p272|Is that possible?
p272_164|p272|I will tell you.
p272_170|p272|Again, we were lucky.
p272_158|p272|We are on a four-year mission.
p272_010|p272|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p272_004|p272|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p272_038|p272|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p272_212|p272|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p272_206|p272|In each case they were a goal down.
p272_207|p272|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p272_213|p272|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p272_039|p272|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p272_005|p272|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p272_011|p272|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p272_159|p272|They should come clean.
p272_171|p272|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p272_165|p272|I've put my own money into this project.
p272_398|p272|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p272_373|p272|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p272_367|p272|It was a funny game.
p272_401|p272|What was the difference between them?
p272_405|p272|It is an absolute nonsense.
p272_363|p272|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p272_377|p272|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p272_411|p272|He got his degree.
p272_388|p272|It is unusual.
p272_149|p272|It is not just about pay.
p272_161|p272|He can do no wrong.
p272_175|p272|As we worked.
p272_029|p272|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p272_015|p272|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p272_217|p272|But she was.
p272_203|p272|Twaddle is a case in point.
p272_202|p272|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p272_216|p272|The report is due out next month.
p272_014|p272|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p272_028|p272|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p272_174|p272|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p272_160|p272|My Dad is a hero.
p272_148|p272|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p272_389|p272|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p272_376|p272|You can cope with it.
p272_410|p272|Feel the air, the space.
p272_404|p272|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p272_362|p272|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p272_348|p272|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p272_412|p272|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p272_374|p272|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p272_360|p272|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p272_406|p272|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p272_176|p272|Tony had arrived.
p272_162|p272|Well, he should know.
p272_189|p272|It's a fact.
p272_002|p272|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p272_016|p272|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p272_228|p272|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p272_200|p272|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p272_214|p272|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p272_215|p272|It's not before time.
p272_201|p272|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p272_229|p272|But it's a subtle process.
p272_017|p272|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p272_003|p272|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p272_188|p272|Peace was won.
p272_163|p272|It is so unfair.
p272_177|p272|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p272_361|p272|They have not done so this season so far.
p272_407|p272|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p272_375|p272|Something is wrong.
p272_349|p272|We will be homeless.
p272_350|p272|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p272_344|p272|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p272_378|p272|That's the name of the game, though.
p272_393|p272|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p272_387|p272|I was in the train station overnight.
p272_152|p272|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p272_146|p272|She died at her home.
p272_191|p272|We believe a third party was involved.
p272_185|p272|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p272_026|p272|Is this accurate?
p272_032|p272|He was jailed for five years.
p272_224|p272|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p272_230|p272|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p272_218|p272|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p272_219|p272|At the time, he was a living legend.
p272_231|p272|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p272_225|p272|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p272_033|p272|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p272_027|p272|They have no history.
p272_184|p272|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p272_190|p272|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p272_147|p272|He realises his mistake.
p272_153|p272|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p272_386|p272|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p272_392|p272|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p272_379|p272|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p272_345|p272|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p272_351|p272|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p272_347|p272|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p272_353|p272|There was a substantial explosion.
p272_409|p272|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p272_384|p272|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p272_390|p272|It's like a basketball.
p272_145|p272|Who would be right?
p272_151|p272|So I got a blood test.
p272_179|p272|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p272_186|p272|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p272_192|p272|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p272_031|p272|This is the window.
p272_025|p272|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p272_019|p272|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p272_233|p272|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p272_227|p272|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p272_226|p272|There is no excuse.
p272_232|p272|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p272_018|p272|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p272_024|p272|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p272_030|p272|There's a story, too.
p272_193|p272|Tommy is not a problem.
p272_187|p272|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p272_178|p272|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p272_150|p272|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p272_144|p272|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p272_391|p272|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p272_385|p272|It's a real problem.
p272_408|p272|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p272_352|p272|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p272_346|p272|As, indeed, they would be.
p272_342|p272|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p272_356|p272|Four policemen were wounded.
p272_381|p272|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p272_395|p272|It was a breathtaking moment.
p272_168|p272|We've all had the shots.
p272_140|p272|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p272_154|p272|I was so nervous.
p272_183|p272|Our team is just so young.
p272_197|p272|It was worth a photograph.
p272_008|p272|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p272_034|p272|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p272_020|p272|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p272_236|p272|The scene is about this?
p272_222|p272|However, no further action was taken by police.
p272_223|p272|Until they came to do it.
p272_237|p272|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p272_021|p272|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p272_035|p272|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p272_009|p272|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p272_196|p272|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p272_182|p272|What has caused the demise of singing?
p272_155|p272|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p272_141|p272|I had decided to quit the show.
p272_169|p272|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p272_394|p272|It was a kind of contempt.
p272_380|p272|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p272_357|p272|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p272_343|p272|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p272_369|p272|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p272_355|p272|He could make it.
p272_341|p272|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p272_396|p272|The car was just there.
p272_382|p272|At the last I found a bunker.
p272_157|p272|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p272_143|p272|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p272_194|p272|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p272_180|p272|They need to look after themselves.
p272_023|p272|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p272_037|p272|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p272_209|p272|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p272_221|p272|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p272_235|p272|Our policy is clear.
p272_234|p272|It is hard won.
p272_220|p272|They must do it.
p272_208|p272|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p272_036|p272|Was it worth it?
p272_022|p272|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p272_181|p272|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p272_195|p272|But she might be.
p272_142|p272|We want to keep the pound.
p272_156|p272|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p272_383|p272|Yet the data is compelling.
p272_397|p272|It will take place in July.
p272_340|p272|She said they would appeal.
p272_354|p272|Not so, it seems.
p272_368|p272|He was the architect.
p272_333|p272|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p272_327|p272|Two people were interviewed.
p272_131|p272|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p272_125|p272|Who would have?
p272_119|p272|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p272_045|p272|He's just in it for himself.
p272_051|p272|It is bizarre.
p272_079|p272|I had my suspicions.
p272_086|p272|Today she has been released.
p272_092|p272|By then, he was walking on water.
p272_247|p272|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p272_253|p272|Blood samples were taken.
p272_284|p272|Bombing slaughter rejected
p272_290|p272|What has altered?
p272_291|p272|I was brought up in a mining background.
p272_285|p272|The songs are just so good.
p272_252|p272|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p272_246|p272|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p272_093|p272|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p272_087|p272|He is in the queue.
p272_078|p272|Painful, but only because it's true.
p272_050|p272|This represents a tough game for us.
p272_044|p272|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p272_118|p272|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p272_124|p272|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p272_130|p272|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p272_326|p272|These days are long gone.
p272_332|p272|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p272_324|p272|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p272_330|p272|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p272_318|p272|I was invited to work in Germany.
p272_126|p272|There were no grounds for his action.
p272_132|p272|No production was achieved.
p272_052|p272|They said she was stable.
p272_046|p272|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p272_091|p272|Someone who cares
p272_085|p272|Even the one she loved.
p272_250|p272|They must play for each other.
p272_244|p272|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p272_278|p272|It was a virus.
p272_293|p272|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p272_287|p272|There's a pause.
p272_286|p272|The goals will come.
p272_292|p272|Nothing is safe.
p272_279|p272|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p272_245|p272|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p272_251|p272|Souter will be back.
p272_084|p272|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p272_090|p272|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p272_047|p272|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p272_053|p272|Is a drug dealer?
p272_133|p272|The BBC was a disgrace.
p272_127|p272|I can't even get into the A team.
p272_319|p272|Is that an issue?
p272_331|p272|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p272_325|p272|Well, it won't.
p272_309|p272|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p272_321|p272|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p272_335|p272|He loves the big occasions.
p272_123|p272|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p272_137|p272|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p272_057|p272|He looks like an Afghan.
p272_043|p272|Indeed, he does.
p272_094|p272|It is a blow.
p272_080|p272|He was at home with his pals.
p272_269|p272|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p272_255|p272|We shall rely on human beings.
p272_241|p272|The concerns are the same.
p272_296|p272|They are wrong.
p272_282|p272|It was good.
p272_283|p272|Who did the recruiting?
p272_297|p272|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p272_240|p272|There's the mix.
p272_254|p272|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p272_268|p272|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p272_081|p272|It was magic.
p272_095|p272|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p272_042|p272|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p272_056|p272|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p272_136|p272|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p272_122|p272|It is rubbish.
p272_334|p272|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p272_320|p272|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p272_308|p272|My body is clearly capable.
p272_336|p272|The performance was excellent.
p272_322|p272|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p272_108|p272|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p272_134|p272|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p272_120|p272|It is so sad.
p272_068|p272|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p272_040|p272|They're just different.
p272_054|p272|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p272_083|p272|It is a job creation scheme.
p272_097|p272|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p272_242|p272|I can't get a job.
p272_256|p272|This is a question of Islam.
p272_281|p272|This is a national crisis.
p272_295|p272|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p272_294|p272|One was a lawyer.
p272_280|p272|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p272_257|p272|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p272_243|p272|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p272_096|p272|They lived for their children.
p272_082|p272|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p272_055|p272|He is too weak to move.
p272_041|p272|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p272_069|p272|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p272_121|p272|The mood is upbeat.
p272_135|p272|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p272_109|p272|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p272_323|p272|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p272_337|p272|That has been lost.
p286_461|p286|They are defined by law.
p286_449|p286|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
p286_111|p286|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p286_105|p286|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p286_139|p286|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p286_065|p286|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p286_071|p286|Then followed a bout of flu.
p286_059|p286|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p286_267|p286|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p286_273|p286|The capital costs are modest.
p286_298|p286|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p286_299|p286|That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
p286_272|p286|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p286_266|p286|His is a global perspective.
p286_058|p286|We have not given up hope.
p286_070|p286|We speak about the performance.
p286_064|p286|They have to come up with a solution.
p286_138|p286|Which can happen any time.
p286_104|p286|Until you hit the big games.
p286_110|p286|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p286_448|p286|The couple had one daughter.
p286_306|p286|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p286_460|p286|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p286_312|p286|Our season is not finished.
p286_462|p286|The peace process will be buried!
p286_304|p286|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p286_310|p286|But it has been an amazing experience.
p286_338|p286|The letters are going out today.
p286_106|p286|We will deal with the refugees.
p286_112|p286|He was forced to quit.
p286_072|p286|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p286_066|p286|It is a great feeling right now.
p286_099|p286|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p286_270|p286|I should think so, too.
p286_264|p286|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p286_258|p286|There were no reports of casualties.
p286_259|p286|This fact is supported by audience research.
p286_265|p286|We have no information on Iraq.
p286_271|p286|No production contract is yet in sight.
p286_098|p286|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p286_067|p286|It's not covered by the insurance.
p286_073|p286|That would be too easy.
p286_113|p286|But I know the course.
p286_107|p286|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p286_339|p286|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p286_311|p286|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p286_463|p286|We are now up against it.
p286_305|p286|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p286_329|p286|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p286_301|p286|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p286_467|p286|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
p286_315|p286|I was there five months ago.
p286_103|p286|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p286_117|p286|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p286_077|p286|Even the one she loved.
p286_063|p286|It seems to have worked.
p286_088|p286|It's so hard to shift.
p286_249|p286|She will attend in July.
p286_275|p286|This idea has been around for four years.
p286_261|p286|And it was this one.
p286_260|p286|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p286_274|p286|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p286_248|p286|They are the innocent victims.
p286_089|p286|Potions said he would drive.
p286_062|p286|We have to keep our clients.
p286_076|p286|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p286_116|p286|In the end we made too many errors.
p286_102|p286|I cannot believe this decision.
p286_314|p286|The effect was almost magical.
p286_300|p286|You have to expect this type of thing.
p286_466|p286|He was backed by Downing Street.
p286_328|p286|The dealer is on notice.
p286_458|p286|The boys are mentally focused.
p286_316|p286|I am a retailer by nature.
p286_464|p286|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p286_302|p286|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p286_128|p286|It isn't a happy memory.
p286_114|p286|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p286_100|p286|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p286_048|p286|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p286_060|p286|We would have concerns about suspension.
p286_074|p286|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p286_262|p286|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p286_276|p286|And they were being paid?
p286_289|p286|It wasn't about one player.
p286_288|p286|The stage was set for a showdown.
p286_277|p286|was everything done to save people?
p286_263|p286|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p286_075|p286|It is a job creation scheme.
p286_061|p286|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p286_049|p286|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p286_101|p286|It really was an unusual award.
p286_115|p286|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p286_129|p286|The firm also has a construction division.
p286_465|p286|It is vital to clarify their role.
p286_303|p286|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p286_317|p286|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p286_459|p286|The damage has been done.
p286_370|p286|You did not see it.
p286_416|p286|Three years ago he would have been.
p286_402|p286|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p286_364|p286|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p286_358|p286|The pain is still acute.
p286_172|p286|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p286_166|p286|My Dad is a hero.
p286_199|p286|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p286_006|p286|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p286_012|p286|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p286_204|p286|how do you get it back?
p286_210|p286|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p286_238|p286|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p286_239|p286|Laura is an investment banker.
p286_211|p286|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p286_205|p286|What are you not good at?
p286_013|p286|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p286_007|p286|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p286_198|p286|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
p286_167|p286|It should never have happened.
p286_173|p286|That would open the gates of hell.
p286_359|p286|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p286_403|p286|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p286_365|p286|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p286_371|p286|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p286_417|p286|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p286_367|p286|I think we'll just keep it.
p286_401|p286|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p286_415|p286|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p286_373|p286|Neither woman has been named.
p286_429|p286|I never had a childhood.
p286_398|p286|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p286_165|p286|We will turn the corner.
p286_171|p286|It's never great to finish second.
p286_159|p286|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p286_011|p286|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p286_005|p286|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p286_039|p286|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p286_213|p286|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p286_207|p286|Who was she?
p286_206|p286|I think, therefore I am?
p286_212|p286|Because he was born in England.
p286_038|p286|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p286_004|p286|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p286_010|p286|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p286_158|p286|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p286_170|p286|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p286_164|p286|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p286_399|p286|In fact, he was great today.
p286_428|p286|It was a breathtaking moment.
p286_414|p286|It's just a training thing.
p286_372|p286|I was delighted to accept.
p286_366|p286|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p286_400|p286|A review is under way.
p286_438|p286|Which may be the same thing.
p286_404|p286|Well, the big day has arrived.
p286_362|p286|My view has now completely changed.
p286_376|p286|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p286_410|p286|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p286_389|p286|The director will be present.
p286_148|p286|What happened in that game?
p286_160|p286|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p286_174|p286|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p286_028|p286|Because we do not need it.
p286_014|p286|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p286_216|p286|This will be our new beginning.
p286_202|p286|It caused a lot of upset.
p286_203|p286|Does the name matter?
p286_217|p286|They have the cash and the fire power.
p286_001|p286|Please call Stella.  
p286_015|p286|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p286_175|p286|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p286_161|p286|Behind him was his brother.
p286_149|p286|Are you going to win?
p286_388|p286|That time may never be broken.
p286_377|p286|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p286_411|p286|I've had a wonderful career.
p286_405|p286|Clark is back on top form.
p286_363|p286|We have very limited capacity.
p286_439|p286|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p286_349|p286|What form did that take?
p286_413|p286|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p286_375|p286|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p286_361|p286|I have a moral dilemma.
p286_407|p286|It's too close to call.
p286_177|p286|They could not match it.
p286_163|p286|The family kept away from me.
p286_188|p286|We have a long way to go this week.
p286_003|p286|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p286_017|p286|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p286_229|p286|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p286_201|p286|We represent a wide range of society.
p286_215|p286|It was a moment of madness.
p286_214|p286|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p286_200|p286|I'm interested in interesting work.
p286_228|p286|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p286_016|p286|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p286_002|p286|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p286_189|p286|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p286_162|p286|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p286_176|p286|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p286_360|p286|I'd like to take the plunge.
p286_406|p286|The choice is strictly personal.
p286_412|p286|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p286_374|p286|You need a licence to run a pub.
p286_348|p286|Is our children learning?
p286_351|p286|Is there a waiting list?
p286_437|p286|That was a great performance by the team.
p286_423|p286|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p286_345|p286|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p286_379|p286|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p286_392|p286|Does it matter?
p286_386|p286|One-third of the places are already taken.
p286_153|p286|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p286_147|p286|They could use a boost.
p286_190|p286|His son is a local legend.
p286_184|p286|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p286_027|p286|I am pretty careful with money.
p286_033|p286|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p286_225|p286|This will take several weeks.
p286_231|p286|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p286_219|p286|We should all be grateful.
p286_218|p286|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p286_230|p286|His injury was completely random.
p286_224|p286|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p286_032|p286|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p286_026|p286|We must convince the citizens.
p286_185|p286|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p286_191|p286|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p286_146|p286|He will get his chances.
p286_152|p286|What do we want to do that for?
p286_387|p286|The marshall at the turn was great.
p286_393|p286|How do you take them away?
p286_378|p286|Finally came the moment of truth.
p286_422|p286|That was a touch of class.
p286_344|p286|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p286_350|p286|Are they free?
p286_436|p286|But he gave no details.
p286_346|p286|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p286_420|p286|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p286_434|p286|The growth potential is enormous.
p286_352|p286|They were impressive against France.
p286_408|p286|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p286_385|p286|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p286_391|p286|Is it worth it?
p286_144|p286|The first half was depressing.
p286_150|p286|Was it the wife?
p286_178|p286|One season, they might do well.
p286_187|p286|Each case is treated on merit.
p286_193|p286|They need to look after themselves.
p286_030|p286|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p286_024|p286|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p286_018|p286|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p286_232|p286|It will affect their work.
p286_226|p286|Scotland will play its part.
p286_227|p286|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p286_233|p286|These things have not happened by accident.
p286_019|p286|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p286_025|p286|Smoking is also very important.
p286_031|p286|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p286_192|p286|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
p286_186|p286|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p286_179|p286|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p286_151|p286|Why change it?
p286_145|p286|Tiger is not the norm.
p286_390|p286|Rugby has an extended run.
p286_384|p286|The team hadn't been picked.
p286_409|p286|They were a lovely family.
p286_435|p286|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p286_353|p286|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p286_347|p286|Do you think we are a top nation?
p286_421|p286|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p286_419|p286|It had been on the cards.
p286_425|p286|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p286_343|p286|My body is clearly capable.
p286_357|p286|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p286_431|p286|It's going to be epic.
p286_380|p286|It's as wide as a church in here.
p286_394|p286|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p286_169|p286|The bank was now involved.
p286_141|p286|My life has changed a lot.
p286_155|p286|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p286_182|p286|This championship is different from the other majors.
p286_196|p286|I cannot say too much about them.
p286_009|p286|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p286_035|p286|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p286_021|p286|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p286_237|p286|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p286_223|p286|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p286_222|p286|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p286_236|p286|He must get to know himself.
p286_020|p286|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p286_034|p286|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p286_008|p286|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p286_197|p286|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p286_183|p286|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p286_154|p286|Anyone can do the sums.
p286_140|p286|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p286_168|p286|We did what we had to do.
p286_395|p286|After the match, do you?
p286_381|p286|She is obviously very disappointed.
p286_356|p286|Whether this return was too soon.
p286_430|p286|Nobody should believe this story.
p286_424|p286|It was important to win the singles.
p286_342|p286|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p286_418|p286|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p286_368|p286|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p286_432|p286|They did the right thing.
p286_354|p286|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p286_340|p286|I didn't have the reply.
p286_426|p286|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p286_397|p286|It gets into the culture.
p286_383|p286|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p286_156|p286|He's not a Celtic man.
p286_142|p286|He said to give a local injection.
p286_195|p286|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p286_181|p286|People should not become complacent.
p286_022|p286|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p286_036|p286|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p286_208|p286|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p286_220|p286|The early physical reports were clear.
p286_234|p286|They are difficult awards to decide.
p286_235|p286|I am considered a teenager.
p286_221|p286|The result is utterly compelling.
p286_209|p286|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p286_037|p286|Costs have got to be controlled.
p286_023|p286|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p286_180|p286|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p286_194|p286|Miller was every bit as happy.
p286_143|p286|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p286_157|p286|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p286_382|p286|It is not for any other purpose.
p286_396|p286|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p286_341|p286|The actor has met with Mandela.
p286_427|p286|No date has been fixed for his return.
p286_433|p286|There is another important factor.
p286_355|p286|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p286_369|p286|Do not forget about Monaco.
p286_454|p286|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p286_332|p286|The party lasted all night.
p286_326|p286|You are a different people.
p286_440|p286|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p286_468|p286|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p286_130|p286|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p286_124|p286|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p286_118|p286|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p286_044|p286|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p286_050|p286|We are a new department.
p286_078|p286|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p286_087|p286|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p286_093|p286|So, did she meet him?
p286_246|p286|This would include the GM food industry.
p286_252|p286|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p286_285|p286|These figures are truly terrible.
p286_291|p286|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p286_290|p286|That view has not altered.
p286_284|p286|They must play for each other.
p286_253|p286|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p286_247|p286|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p286_092|p286|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p286_086|p286|We have to offer value for money.
p286_079|p286|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p286_051|p286|He also presented You Bet!
p286_045|p286|I had come back from London.
p286_119|p286|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p286_125|p286|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p286_131|p286|Then again, we could have.
p286_327|p286|McNaughton was not so sure.
p286_441|p286|Everything in golf is a balance.
p286_455|p286|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p286_333|p286|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p286_443|p286|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p286_325|p286|They can go to no other method of fishing.
p286_331|p286|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
p286_457|p286|It was his job to check.
p286_319|p286|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p286_127|p286|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p286_133|p286|Structural changes were also required.
p286_053|p286|How are you, sir?
p286_047|p286|I had trouble with the producers.
p286_090|p286|Theatre is not a museum.
p286_084|p286|He has been a success this year.
p286_251|p286|She claimed the day was for young people.
p286_245|p286|The scientific debate is dead.
p286_279|p286|Do I think about them often?
p286_292|p286|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p286_286|p286|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p286_287|p286|There's not much money in cycling.
p286_293|p286|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p286_278|p286|What was the matter for concern?
p286_244|p286|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p286_250|p286|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p286_085|p286|The error appeared in a warrant.
p286_091|p286|Why do it otherwise?
p286_046|p286|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p286_052|p286|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p286_132|p286|They will remember this victory for a while.
p286_126|p286|Maybe this battle has been.
p286_318|p286|Holland won by five wickets.
p286_330|p286|It is a road of death.
p286_456|p286|They were good years for him.
p286_442|p286|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p286_324|p286|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p286_308|p286|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p286_320|p286|He has taken the title for the last two years.
p286_446|p286|He had no problems with discipline.
p286_452|p286|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p286_334|p286|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p286_122|p286|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p286_136|p286|However, the problem is the timing.
p286_056|p286|People come to see the Highlands.
p286_042|p286|He looks like an Afghan.
p286_095|p286|And does it?
p286_081|p286|It's all going to clear the debt.
p286_268|p286|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p286_254|p286|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p286_240|p286|You could feel the heat.
p286_297|p286|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p286_283|p286|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p286_282|p286|That will be a problem for later.
p286_296|p286|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p286_241|p286|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p286_255|p286|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p286_269|p286|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p286_080|p286|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p286_094|p286|So what is the campaign about?
p286_043|p286|He will need that machine.
p286_057|p286|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p286_137|p286|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p286_123|p286|I have learned from him.
p286_453|p286|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
p286_335|p286|Six other people were injured.
p286_321|p286|The songs are just so good.
p286_447|p286|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p286_309|p286|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p286_337|p286|Survival is not an option.
p286_451|p286|The jury is still out.
p286_445|p286|There were no formal announcements.
p286_323|p286|We need to increase the membership.
p286_109|p286|They must be on commission.
p286_135|p286|His job was not advertised.
p286_121|p286|It is an impressive record.
p286_069|p286|It wasn't possible to relax.
p286_041|p286|Among them are many criminals.
p286_055|p286|Do I have a favourite?
p286_082|p286|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p286_096|p286|Are you from the rugby?
p286_243|p286|I have spoken to the skipper.
p286_257|p286|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p286_280|p286|Is it in the right place?
p286_294|p286|It was an easy decision to come here.
p286_295|p286|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p286_281|p286|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p286_256|p286|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p286_242|p286|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p286_097|p286|Had I heard?
p286_083|p286|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p286_054|p286|So is that it, then?
p286_040|p286|It is serious - but not that serious.
p286_068|p286|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p286_120|p286|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p286_134|p286|It was a good game to watch.
p286_108|p286|We could not get any possession.
p286_444|p286|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p286_322|p286|I must do something about it.
p286_336|p286|And he goes with it.
p286_450|p286|We make this offer to the parliament.
p226_258|p226|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p226_099|p226|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p226_072|p226|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p226_066|p226|Art is extra.
p226_106|p226|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p226_112|p226|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p226_304|p226|Our task is to complete the picture.
p226_310|p226|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p226_338|p226|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p226_339|p226|My view has now completely changed.
p226_311|p226|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p226_305|p226|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p226_113|p226|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
p226_107|p226|It was a good performance.
p226_067|p226|It's a matter of balance.
p226_073|p226|The script was funny.
p226_098|p226|If you could find it.
p226_259|p226|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p226_265|p226|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p226_271|p226|He was popular.
p226_298|p226|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p226_267|p226|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p226_273|p226|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p226_065|p226|You do not change overnight.
p226_071|p226|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p226_059|p226|She's a spy!
p226_111|p226|It was an adventure.
p226_105|p226|May not have been at fault?
p226_139|p226|I am now unemployed.
p226_313|p226|The minister is the engineer.
p226_307|p226|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p226_306|p226|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p226_312|p226|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p226_138|p226|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p226_104|p226|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p226_110|p226|Before the game we went for a pint.
p226_058|p226|Next league matches Celtic.
p226_070|p226|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p226_064|p226|It is not great art.
p226_272|p226|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p226_266|p226|The warning is timely.
p226_299|p226|There was no hint of scandal.
p226_289|p226|This is a national crisis.
p226_262|p226|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p226_276|p226|It's a way of life.
p226_048|p226|It's a blessing.
p226_060|p226|It is unique.
p226_074|p226|You need a trademark.
p226_128|p226|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p226_114|p226|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p226_100|p226|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p226_316|p226|The whole region is in shock.
p226_302|p226|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p226_303|p226|One was a lawyer.
p226_317|p226|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p226_101|p226|It was mayhem.
p226_115|p226|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p226_129|p226|She has been shot.
p226_075|p226|Painful, but only because it's true.
p226_061|p226|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p226_049|p226|But it might have done.
p226_263|p226|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p226_288|p226|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p226_249|p226|I should think so, too.
p226_261|p226|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p226_088|p226|Detection is often difficult.
p226_077|p226|Tommy is not a problem.
p226_063|p226|It's a real challenge.
p226_103|p226|They were outside the circle.
p226_117|p226|I don't have many friends.
p226_329|p226|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p226_301|p226|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p226_315|p226|It was a question of patience.
p226_314|p226|I did not name it.
p226_300|p226|I thought it was my only chance.
p226_328|p226|That's the law of the land.
p226_116|p226|It is normal.
p226_102|p226|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p226_062|p226|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p226_076|p226|Help is needed.
p226_089|p226|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p226_260|p226|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p226_274|p226|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p226_248|p226|I was shocked.
p226_213|p226|Feel the heat?
p226_207|p226|It's a mixture of everything.
p226_011|p226|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p226_005|p226|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p226_039|p226|It has failed.
p226_165|p226|We have to move forward.
p226_171|p226|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p226_159|p226|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p226_367|p226|Equity declined to comment.
p226_366|p226|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p226_158|p226|We will turn the corner.
p226_164|p226|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p226_004|p226|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p226_010|p226|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p226_206|p226|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p226_212|p226|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p226_204|p226|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p226_210|p226|It's like a garage.
p226_238|p226|Hospitals are for the ill.
p226_006|p226|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p226_012|p226|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p226_199|p226|We live by the rule of law.
p226_172|p226|It became a book by itself.
p226_166|p226|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p226_370|p226|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p226_364|p226|This is a club on the rise.
p226_358|p226|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p226_359|p226|He's very explosive.
p226_365|p226|I have got a wife to feed.
p226_167|p226|They will do their own thing.
p226_173|p226|His team management was protective.
p226_198|p226|Is that it?
p226_013|p226|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p226_007|p226|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p226_239|p226|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p226_211|p226|But I am a worried man.
p226_205|p226|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p226_229|p226|I'd never seen a play about me.
p226_201|p226|The service from the other players was super.
p226_215|p226|I am delighted for Simon.
p226_003|p226|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p226_017|p226|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p226_188|p226|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p226_177|p226|I took the gun.
p226_163|p226|I've learned from my mistakes.
p226_349|p226|He's been the key to everything.
p226_361|p226|Our numbers are small.
p226_360|p226|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p226_348|p226|Look at the witnesses.
p226_162|p226|It is an attitude of mind.
p226_176|p226|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p226_189|p226|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p226_016|p226|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p226_002|p226|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p226_214|p226|I'm pleased about one thing.
p226_200|p226|Is that success?
p226_228|p226|I am immensely sad.
p226_216|p226|His third goal was superb.
p226_202|p226|They are in the euro.
p226_028|p226|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p226_014|p226|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p226_148|p226|Three penalties were given.
p226_160|p226|They should stop the bombing.
p226_174|p226|It's quite a routine.
p226_362|p226|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p226_363|p226|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p226_175|p226|It is not either national standards or local control.
p226_161|p226|These days are long gone.
p226_149|p226|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p226_001|p226|Please call Stella.  
p226_015|p226|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p226_029|p226|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p226_203|p226|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p226_217|p226|It's not ideal.
p226_232|p226|My wife and family are the support system.
p226_226|p226|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p226_030|p226|Because we do not need it.
p226_024|p226|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p226_018|p226|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p226_187|p226|I had a train to catch.
p226_193|p226|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p226_144|p226|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p226_150|p226|We just had a go.
p226_178|p226|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p226_346|p226|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p226_352|p226|His contract was then not renewed.
p226_353|p226|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p226_347|p226|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p226_179|p226|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p226_151|p226|We have seen a copy of the report.
p226_145|p226|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p226_192|p226|People will ask about us.
p226_186|p226|It just came into my head that day.
p226_019|p226|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p226_025|p226|He has not been named.
p226_031|p226|This is the window.
p226_227|p226|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p226_233|p226|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p226_225|p226|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p226_231|p226|The track is currently covered in snow.
p226_219|p226|I might come back.
p226_027|p226|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p226_033|p226|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
p226_190|p226|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p226_184|p226|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p226_153|p226|That group reported just before Christmas.
p226_351|p226|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p226_345|p226|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p226_344|p226|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p226_350|p226|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p226_146|p226|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p226_152|p226|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p226_185|p226|It is not fair.
p226_191|p226|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p226_032|p226|I was an athlete.
p226_026|p226|That's no bad thing.
p226_218|p226|I was so nervous.
p226_230|p226|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p226_224|p226|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p226_208|p226|I don't want to use it.
p226_220|p226|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p226_234|p226|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p226_022|p226|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p226_036|p226|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p226_195|p226|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p226_181|p226|I've been there.
p226_156|p226|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p226_142|p226|Government will intervene.
p226_368|p226|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p226_354|p226|That is a break with tradition.
p226_340|p226|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p226_341|p226|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p226_355|p226|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p226_369|p226|He took over our lives.
p226_143|p226|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p226_157|p226|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p226_180|p226|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p226_194|p226|It is a case of taking a risk.
p226_037|p226|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p226_023|p226|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p226_235|p226|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p226_221|p226|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p226_209|p226|Now, it's all right.
p226_237|p226|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p226_223|p226|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p226_009|p226|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p226_021|p226|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p226_169|p226|Nobody did in those days.
p226_141|p226|Our intentions are real.
p226_155|p226|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p226_343|p226|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p226_357|p226|I kept going for her.
p226_356|p226|She is free.
p226_342|p226|Three years ago he would have been.
p226_154|p226|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p226_140|p226|They made such decisions in London.
p226_168|p226|It is too much for me.
p226_197|p226|There was no option.
p226_183|p226|I have no sympathy with her at all.
p226_020|p226|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p226_034|p226|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p226_008|p226|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p226_236|p226|It is set in Paris.
p226_292|p226|It goes back a long way.
p226_286|p226|Yet, it worked.
p226_251|p226|There's the mix.
p226_245|p226|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p226_279|p226|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p226_090|p226|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p226_084|p226|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p226_053|p226|He had no enemies.
p226_047|p226|We need to chat.
p226_127|p226|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p226_133|p226|She really suffered for her art.
p226_325|p226|I am very happy to be here.
p226_331|p226|Donald was his friend.
p226_319|p226|Craig is a major concern for us.
p226_318|p226|Kids are terrible.
p226_330|p226|The weekly average was three hours.
p226_324|p226|We are in the end game.
p226_132|p226|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p226_126|p226|It is a delight on every level.
p226_046|p226|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p226_052|p226|It is the whole package.
p226_085|p226|It can be halted.
p226_091|p226|Someone who cares
p226_278|p226|I feel pretty good.
p226_244|p226|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p226_287|p226|Who will perform?
p226_293|p226|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p226_285|p226|It was a virus.
p226_291|p226|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p226_246|p226|His body was never found.
p226_252|p226|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p226_093|p226|It's never too late.
p226_044|p226|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p226_050|p226|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p226_078|p226|There could be a way back.
p226_130|p226|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p226_124|p226|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p226_118|p226|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p226_332|p226|I am so upset.
p226_326|p226|The airport was even different.
p226_327|p226|We do the same.
p226_333|p226|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p226_119|p226|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p226_125|p226|She's got to say something.
p226_131|p226|I was furious.
p226_079|p226|Neither it is.
p226_051|p226|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p226_045|p226|This represents a tough game for us.
p226_092|p226|It's just awful.
p226_086|p226|This is the way things should be handled.
p226_253|p226|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p226_247|p226|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p226_290|p226|Scotland were beaten again.
p226_284|p226|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p226_280|p226|He has a wealth of experience.
p226_294|p226|The results are sometimes contentious.
p226_243|p226|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p226_257|p226|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p226_082|p226|It is a terrible place.
p226_096|p226|However, it did not end that way.
p226_069|p226|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p226_041|p226|It is not for any other purpose.
p226_055|p226|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p226_109|p226|Oil embargo endorsed.
p226_135|p226|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p226_121|p226|Maybe this battle has been.
p226_337|p226|I'd like to take the plunge.
p226_323|p226|He said she was mad.
p226_322|p226|Referees are easy targets.
p226_336|p226|It is a time bomb.
p226_120|p226|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p226_134|p226|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p226_108|p226|That time is not now, however.
p226_054|p226|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p226_040|p226|It was clear.
p226_068|p226|Scotland had great assets.
p226_097|p226|We could not get any possession.
p226_083|p226|It works for us.
p226_256|p226|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p226_242|p226|It's only fair.
p226_295|p226|He should have won.
p226_281|p226|It happens from time to time.
p226_297|p226|There's a pause.
p226_283|p226|He looked very sharp.
p226_268|p226|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p226_254|p226|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p226_240|p226|She is well balanced.
p226_095|p226|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p226_056|p226|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p226_042|p226|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p226_122|p226|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p226_136|p226|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p226_308|p226|This is a war over our home.
p226_320|p226|The home team had an amazing start.
p226_334|p226|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p226_335|p226|The boat was fantastic.
p226_321|p226|My body is clearly capable.
p226_309|p226|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p226_137|p226|It will be too hot.
p226_043|p226|Is there a new way forward?
p226_057|p226|It's the big omission.
p226_080|p226|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p226_094|p226|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p226_241|p226|They are all bright and different.
p226_255|p226|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p226_269|p226|They are never here.
p226_296|p226|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p228_145|p228|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p228_151|p228|That should do it.
p228_179|p228|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p228_186|p228|We knew nothing about it.
p228_192|p228|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p228_031|p228|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p228_025|p228|It's nice to hear.
p228_019|p228|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p228_233|p228|We are in the hat.
p228_227|p228|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p228_226|p228|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p228_232|p228|We just had a go.
p228_018|p228|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p228_024|p228|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p228_030|p228|Life was like a timetable.
p228_193|p228|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p228_187|p228|They will run a mile.
p228_178|p228|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p228_150|p228|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p228_144|p228|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p228_352|p228|I expected these kind of questions.
p228_346|p228|That is a break with tradition.
p228_350|p228|As, indeed, they would be.
p228_344|p228|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p228_152|p228|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p228_146|p228|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p228_191|p228|I put the drawing down.
p228_185|p228|I took the gun.
p228_026|p228|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p228_032|p228|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p228_224|p228|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p228_230|p228|You take a risk.
p228_218|p228|That is an important part of our role.
p228_219|p228|She should not be blamed.
p228_231|p228|He is severe.
p228_225|p228|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p228_033|p228|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p228_027|p228|Because we do not need it.
p228_184|p228|I drove the ball well.
p228_190|p228|Miller was every bit as happy.
p228_147|p228|Who would be right?
p228_153|p228|It is not just about pay.
p228_345|p228|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p228_351|p228|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p228_369|p228|There is no signature.
p228_355|p228|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p228_341|p228|They should take their mobile phones.
p228_157|p228|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p228_143|p228|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p228_194|p228|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p228_180|p228|One season, they might do well.
p228_023|p228|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p228_037|p228|Indeed, he does.
p228_209|p228|Who will pay for this?
p228_221|p228|His third goal was superb.
p228_235|p228|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p228_234|p228|We were a load of rubbish.
p228_220|p228|I had decided to quit the show.
p228_208|p228|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p228_036|p228|The problem is the pitch.
p228_022|p228|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p228_181|p228|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p228_195|p228|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p228_142|p228|He was in a great deal of pain.
p228_156|p228|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p228_340|p228|He's a genius.
p228_354|p228|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p228_368|p228|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p228_342|p228|It is not like working for a living.
p228_356|p228|Equity declined to comment.
p228_168|p228|I've put my own money into this project.
p228_140|p228|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p228_154|p228|I am just trying to do my job.
p228_183|p228|The hotel was now for sale.
p228_197|p228|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p228_008|p228|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p228_034|p228|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p228_020|p228|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p228_236|p228|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p228_222|p228|It's been a good year.
p228_223|p228|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p228_237|p228|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p228_021|p228|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p228_035|p228|It was clear.
p228_009|p228|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p228_196|p228|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p228_182|p228|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p228_155|p228|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p228_141|p228|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p228_169|p228|Eight months later, he was dead.
p228_357|p228|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p228_343|p228|It's the last thing on my mind.
p228_324|p228|There was no option.
p228_330|p228|It is so unfair.
p228_318|p228|He was then replaced by Ross.
p228_126|p228|Who would be a referee?
p228_132|p228|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p228_052|p228|He looks like an Afghan.
p228_046|p228|We need to chat.
p228_091|p228|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p228_085|p228|But she might be.
p228_250|p228|I can't get a job.
p228_244|p228|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p228_278|p228|All options are open.
p228_293|p228|Our task is to complete the picture.
p228_287|p228|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p228_286|p228|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p228_292|p228|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p228_279|p228|He will address the nation this evening.
p228_245|p228|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p228_251|p228|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p228_084|p228|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p228_090|p228|Now the system is right behind us.
p228_047|p228|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p228_053|p228|Here's a clue.
p228_133|p228|This plan is an agenda for action.
p228_127|p228|They've got to account for it.
p228_319|p228|Is that an issue?
p228_331|p228|He has to learn.
p228_325|p228|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p228_333|p228|I've got no secret.
p228_327|p228|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p228_131|p228|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p228_125|p228|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p228_119|p228|It's in his blood.
p228_045|p228|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p228_051|p228|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p228_079|p228|I had my suspicions.
p228_086|p228|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p228_092|p228|Today I couldn't run on it.
p228_247|p228|He's a lovely young man.
p228_253|p228|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p228_284|p228|It changed my life.
p228_290|p228|Graeme was prepared.
p228_291|p228|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p228_285|p228|The songs are just so good.
p228_252|p228|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p228_246|p228|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p228_093|p228|However, it did not end that way.
p228_087|p228|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p228_078|p228|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p228_050|p228|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p228_044|p228|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p228_118|p228|Further protests are likely.
p228_124|p228|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p228_130|p228|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p228_326|p228|It is a sign of hope.
p228_332|p228|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p228_336|p228|It was forced to divert.
p228_322|p228|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p228_108|p228|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p228_134|p228|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p228_120|p228|I don't want to use the term.
p228_068|p228|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p228_040|p228|My whole life has changed.
p228_054|p228|It had been in place since last July.
p228_083|p228|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p228_097|p228|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p228_242|p228|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p228_256|p228|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p228_281|p228|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p228_295|p228|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p228_294|p228|They are wrong.
p228_280|p228|We want to see the maximum of change.
p228_257|p228|Is that a serious question?
p228_243|p228|You can feel at home in China.
p228_096|p228|It is an old family habit.
p228_082|p228|Today she has been released.
p228_055|p228|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p228_041|p228|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p228_069|p228|He is a young man with a new deal.
p228_121|p228|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p228_135|p228|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p228_109|p228|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p228_323|p228|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p228_337|p228|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p228_309|p228|He said she was mad.
p228_321|p228|Robert is a special talent.
p228_335|p228|A great deal has been achieved.
p228_123|p228|It is so sad.
p228_137|p228|Who will attend?
p228_057|p228|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p228_043|p228|It is urgent.
p228_094|p228|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p228_269|p228|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p228_255|p228|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p228_241|p228|It's only fair.
p228_296|p228|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p228_282|p228|He was obviously very genuine.
p228_283|p228|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p228_297|p228|You are the glory.
p228_240|p228|She was well balanced.
p228_254|p228|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p228_268|p228|I was rubbish.
p228_081|p228|People must remain vigilant.
p228_095|p228|Safety was also an issue.
p228_042|p228|No meaningful response was issued.
p228_056|p228|That's the day job.
p228_136|p228|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p228_122|p228|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p228_334|p228|Tiger is the exception.
p228_320|p228|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p228_308|p228|This film will be totally awesome.
p228_305|p228|We are a peaceful people.
p228_311|p228|I am very happy to be here.
p228_339|p228|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p228_107|p228|It is a good day for the coalition.
p228_113|p228|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p228_073|p228|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p228_067|p228|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p228_098|p228|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p228_271|p228|It's a way of life.
p228_265|p228|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p228_259|p228|They must play for each other.
p228_258|p228|They are real.
p228_264|p228|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p228_270|p228|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p228_099|p228|It is annoying.
p228_066|p228|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p228_072|p228|Try to save us.
p228_112|p228|We have an election in eight days.
p228_106|p228|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p228_338|p228|This is a friendly match?
p228_310|p228|There was some merit in that.
p228_304|p228|It's not even finished.
p228_312|p228|We do the same.
p228_306|p228|Kids are terrible.
p228_110|p228|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p228_104|p228|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p228_138|p228|We had a reunion last week.
p228_064|p228|Scotland had great assets.
p228_070|p228|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p228_058|p228|That's the truth.
p228_266|p228|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p228_272|p228|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p228_299|p228|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p228_298|p228|It's certainly different.
p228_267|p228|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p228_059|p228|That is very hard, alone.
p228_071|p228|The script was funny.
p228_065|p228|It's that kind of place.
p228_139|p228|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p228_105|p228|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p228_111|p228|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p228_307|p228|The problems began a long time ago.
p228_313|p228|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p228_317|p228|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p228_303|p228|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p228_129|p228|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p228_115|p228|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p228_101|p228|I love the Dome.
p228_049|p228|But it might have done.
p228_061|p228|Four other charges were dropped.
p228_075|p228|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p228_263|p228|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p228_277|p228|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p228_288|p228|It became a book by itself.
p228_289|p228|The home was now under new management.
p228_276|p228|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p228_262|p228|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p228_074|p228|Painful, but only because it's true.
p228_060|p228|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p228_048|p228|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
p228_100|p228|We could not get any possession.
p228_114|p228|They will want to perform well.
p228_128|p228|It is a delight on every level.
p228_302|p228|Is there on his hands?
p228_316|p228|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p228_328|p228|It has moved on in the last week.
p228_300|p228|We want to play at the worlds.
p228_102|p228|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p228_116|p228|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p228_076|p228|It's all I can do.
p228_062|p228|They're appalled by that.
p228_089|p228|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p228_248|p228|It was a hit.
p228_274|p228|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p228_260|p228|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p228_261|p228|His contract was then not renewed.
p228_275|p228|They were too hard.
p228_249|p228|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p228_088|p228|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p228_063|p228|There was a battle there.
p228_077|p228|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p228_117|p228|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p228_103|p228|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p228_315|p228|It's not long enough.
p228_301|p228|We have waited a long time for this.
p228_329|p228|The train was on time.
p228_366|p228|But I managed.
p228_164|p228|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p228_170|p228|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p228_158|p228|The weather forecast isn't good.
p228_010|p228|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p228_004|p228|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p228_038|p228|President Bush is at war.
p228_212|p228|A deadline is still essential.
p228_206|p228|They are in the euro.
p228_207|p228|Ferguson should take note.
p228_213|p228|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
p228_039|p228|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p228_005|p228|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p228_011|p228|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p228_159|p228|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p228_171|p228|We have to move forward.
p228_165|p228|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p228_367|p228|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p228_371|p228|It became a national network.
p228_365|p228|So there, we won.
p228_359|p228|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p228_173|p228|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p228_167|p228|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p228_198|p228|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p228_007|p228|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p228_013|p228|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p228_205|p228|I have a cold.
p228_211|p228|He had suffered a heart attack.
p228_239|p228|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p228_238|p228|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p228_210|p228|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p228_204|p228|Is that success?
p228_012|p228|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p228_006|p228|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p228_199|p228|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p228_166|p228|It was so new, so exciting.
p228_172|p228|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p228_358|p228|The play is based on a real-life event.
p228_364|p228|It is a simple equation.
p228_370|p228|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p228_348|p228|Everyone was in tears.
p228_360|p228|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p228_176|p228|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p228_162|p228|It was by the numbers.
p228_189|p228|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p228_002|p228|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p228_016|p228|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p228_228|p228|It is a gamble.
p228_200|p228|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p228_214|p228|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p228_215|p228|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p228_229|p228|It's so special.
p228_003|p228|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p228_188|p228|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p228_163|p228|I was in daily contact.
p228_177|p228|We've made a couple of albums.
p228_361|p228|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p228_349|p228|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p228_363|p228|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p228_149|p228|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p228_161|p228|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p228_175|p228|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p228_029|p228|I feel I did not have enough time.
p228_015|p228|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p228_001|p228|Please call Stella.
p228_217|p228|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p228_203|p228|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p228_202|p228|It's the same old story.
p228_216|p228|That will be vital.
p228_014|p228|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p228_028|p228|There's a story, too.
p228_174|p228|The post will be unpaid.
p228_160|p228|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p228_148|p228|It is difficult for Ali.
p228_362|p228|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p232_324|p232|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p232_330|p232|It could have gone either way.
p232_318|p232|The home team had an amazing start.
p232_293|p232|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p232_287|p232|It happens from time to time.
p232_250|p232|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p232_244|p232|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p232_278|p232|They wanted the club to make money.
p232_091|p232|It is a lifeline.
p232_085|p232|It's all going to clear the debt.
p232_052|p232|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p232_046|p232|The judge said.
p232_047|p232|It is difficult for Ali.
p232_053|p232|It's the big omission.
p232_084|p232|I will miss him.
p232_090|p232|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p232_279|p232|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p232_245|p232|Broke the birdie record.
p232_251|p232|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p232_286|p232|It was a privilege to work for him.
p232_292|p232|The attacker died in the crash.
p232_319|p232|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p232_331|p232|He was then replaced by Ross.
p232_325|p232|Off with their heads.
p232_133|p232|If not, a deal could take many months.
p232_127|p232|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p232_131|p232|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p232_125|p232|I'm so angry.
p232_119|p232|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
p232_333|p232|I'd like to take the plunge.
p232_327|p232|My view has now completely changed.
p232_284|p232|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p232_290|p232|I saw it at a ruck.
p232_247|p232|She is well balanced.
p232_253|p232|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p232_086|p232|She had kept the news from him.
p232_092|p232|Today I couldn't run on it.
p232_045|p232|It is urgent.
p232_051|p232|Here's a clue.
p232_079|p232|He is now resident in England.
p232_078|p232|It is a job creation scheme.
p232_050|p232|They had to explain it.
p232_044|p232|We will push.
p232_093|p232|However, it did not end that way.
p232_087|p232|No progress has been made.
p232_252|p232|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p232_246|p232|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p232_291|p232|They were also beside themselves.
p232_285|p232|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p232_326|p232|It's not long enough.
p232_332|p232|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p232_118|p232|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p232_124|p232|That's all right then.
p232_130|p232|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p232_108|p232|He pleaded for caution.
p232_134|p232|You've got to be vigilant.
p232_120|p232|It is rubbish.
p232_336|p232|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p232_322|p232|However, the groups denied the claims.
p232_281|p232|It's a way of life.
p232_295|p232|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p232_242|p232|It's quite a line-up!
p232_256|p232|A friendship that will endure.
p232_083|p232|That is bound to happen.
p232_097|p232|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p232_068|p232|It is like a river running by my home.
p232_040|p232|Dancing was her life.
p232_054|p232|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p232_055|p232|It's very odd.
p232_041|p232|I suspect the latter.
p232_069|p232|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p232_096|p232|Then came the crunch.
p232_082|p232|What has changed?
p232_257|p232|I can't get a job.
p232_243|p232|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p232_294|p232|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p232_280|p232|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p232_323|p232|I came into this world with nothing.
p232_337|p232|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p232_121|p232|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p232_135|p232|Our intentions are real.
p232_109|p232|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p232_123|p232|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p232_137|p232|The goals were good.
p232_309|p232|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p232_321|p232|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p232_335|p232|She did not attend the courtroom.
p232_296|p232|He was obviously very genuine.
p232_282|p232|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p232_269|p232|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p232_255|p232|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p232_241|p232|It's quite nice.
p232_094|p232|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p232_080|p232|I've got the shirt.
p232_057|p232|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p232_043|p232|But it took a lot of bottle.
p232_042|p232|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p232_056|p232|Because we do not need it.
p232_081|p232|Today she has been released.
p232_095|p232|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p232_240|p232|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p232_254|p232|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p232_268|p232|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p232_283|p232|I am an estate agent.
p232_297|p232|These figures are truly awful.
p232_334|p232|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p232_320|p232|Referees are easy targets.
p232_308|p232|We are in the end game.
p232_136|p232|They took a risk.
p232_122|p232|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p232_186|p232|It is the whole package.
p232_192|p232|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p232_145|p232|We want to see the maximum of change.
p232_151|p232|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p232_179|p232|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p232_384|p232|There is no signature.
p232_390|p232|That's the name of the game, though.
p232_347|p232|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p232_353|p232|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p232_409|p232|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p232_233|p232|The track is currently covered in snow.
p232_227|p232|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p232_031|p232|It's a matter of balance.
p232_025|p232|Johnson was pretty low.
p232_019|p232|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p232_018|p232|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p232_024|p232|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p232_030|p232|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p232_226|p232|Mental health is a massive issue.
p232_232|p232|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p232_408|p232|Feel the air, the space.
p232_352|p232|The boat was fantastic.
p232_346|p232|Tiger is the exception.
p232_391|p232|You thought it was a headache.
p232_385|p232|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p232_178|p232|It's the real thing, for sure.
p232_150|p232|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p232_144|p232|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p232_193|p232|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p232_187|p232|I've been there.
p232_191|p232|I wish I could say something.
p232_185|p232|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p232_152|p232|It was by the numbers.
p232_146|p232|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p232_393|p232|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p232_387|p232|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p232_350|p232|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p232_344|p232|He has to learn.
p232_378|p232|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p232_224|p232|That has been the easy part.
p232_230|p232|I am immensely sad.
p232_218|p232|He seemed to lose his focus.
p232_026|p232|But it failed.
p232_032|p232|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p232_033|p232|I would love it.
p232_027|p232|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p232_219|p232|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p232_231|p232|I'd never seen a play about me.
p232_225|p232|We've got the bronze.
p232_379|p232|They have not done so this season so far.
p232_345|p232|Indeed, it was magical.
p232_351|p232|Everything was an effort.
p232_386|p232|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p232_392|p232|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p232_147|p232|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p232_153|p232|I was in daily contact.
p232_184|p232|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p232_190|p232|We did everything by the book.
p232_194|p232|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p232_180|p232|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p232_143|p232|They did very well.
p232_396|p232|I can lead by example.
p232_382|p232|Five members were disciplined.
p232_369|p232|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p232_355|p232|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p232_341|p232|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p232_209|p232|There was an e-mail.
p232_221|p232|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p232_235|p232|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p232_023|p232|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p232_037|p232|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p232_036|p232|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p232_022|p232|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p232_234|p232|But she was.
p232_220|p232|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p232_208|p232|Now, it's all right.
p232_340|p232|Who will do it?
p232_354|p232|It is long gone.
p232_368|p232|It was one in the afternoon.
p232_383|p232|Talks are progressing.
p232_397|p232|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p232_142|p232|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p232_156|p232|It is an attitude of mind.
p232_181|p232|The clarity is vital.
p232_195|p232|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p232_183|p232|Everyone can be bought.
p232_197|p232|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p232_168|p232|That will do for me.
p232_140|p232|He is severe.
p232_154|p232|They were later discharged from hospital.
p232_381|p232|Well, the big day has arrived.
p232_395|p232|We're looking for justice.
p232_342|p232|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p232_356|p232|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p232_236|p232|We were awful.
p232_008|p232|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p232_034|p232|It is marvellous.
p232_020|p232|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p232_021|p232|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p232_035|p232|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p232_009|p232|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p232_223|p232|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p232_237|p232|However, no further action was taken by police.
p232_357|p232|He had played well in that central role.
p232_343|p232|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p232_394|p232|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p232_380|p232|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p232_155|p232|This latter point is hugely important.
p232_141|p232|She died at her home.
p232_169|p232|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p232_196|p232|I came home by ambulance.
p232_182|p232|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p232_164|p232|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p232_170|p232|We've made a couple of albums.
p232_158|p232|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p232_399|p232|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p232_400|p232|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p232_366|p232|It benefits the whole family.
p232_372|p232|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p232_414|p232|I was very young.
p232_206|p232|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p232_010|p232|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p232_004|p232|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p232_038|p232|It was fit for royalty.
p232_039|p232|I was scared.
p232_005|p232|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p232_011|p232|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p232_207|p232|I don't want to use it.
p232_213|p232|He is slightly confused.
p232_373|p232|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p232_415|p232|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p232_401|p232|It is legally binding.
p232_367|p232|He has seen the past.
p232_398|p232|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p232_159|p232|We have to move forward.
p232_171|p232|My life has been destroyed.
p232_165|p232|Again, we were lucky.
p232_198|p232|The conference is the first test.
p232_173|p232|It became a book by itself.
p232_167|p232|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p232_371|p232|The scene is about this?
p232_365|p232|However, it was well worth the wait.
p232_403|p232|My house was shaking at the time.
p232_359|p232|She is free.
p232_205|p232|It's a mixture of everything.
p232_211|p232|Feel the heat?
p232_239|p232|It is set in Paris.
p232_007|p232|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p232_013|p232|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p232_012|p232|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p232_006|p232|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p232_238|p232|And thought we would get away with it.
p232_210|p232|That's the day job.
p232_204|p232|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p232_358|p232|It's not that clear-cut.
p232_364|p232|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p232_402|p232|We knew nothing about it.
p232_370|p232|We will be homeless.
p232_166|p232|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p232_172|p232|They thought they had found a home.
p232_199|p232|The service from the other players was super.
p232_189|p232|They receive a high profile in the media.
p232_176|p232|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p232_162|p232|Tell it like it was?
p232_348|p232|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p232_374|p232|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p232_412|p232|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p232_406|p232|He was a crazy man.
p232_360|p232|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p232_228|p232|It was good fun.
p232_200|p232|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p232_214|p232|She should not be blamed.
p232_002|p232|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p232_016|p232|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p232_017|p232|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p232_003|p232|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p232_215|p232|His third goal was superb.
p232_201|p232|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p232_229|p232|What was the main difference?
p232_407|p232|We should have known.
p232_361|p232|I kept going for her.
p232_375|p232|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p232_413|p232|It was that bad, that low.
p232_349|p232|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p232_163|p232|It is not too late to get on board.
p232_177|p232|Blair's response was weak.
p232_188|p232|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p232_149|p232|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p232_161|p232|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p232_175|p232|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p232_388|p232|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p232_363|p232|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p232_405|p232|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p232_411|p232|You wanted the evidence.
p232_377|p232|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p232_217|p232|It's not ideal.
p232_203|p232|A deadline is still essential.
p232_029|p232|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p232_015|p232|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p232_001|p232|Please call Stella.  
p232_014|p232|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p232_028|p232|They should be so lucky.
p232_202|p232|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p232_216|p232|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p232_410|p232|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p232_376|p232|He could make it.
p232_362|p232|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p232_404|p232|This is a huge confidence boost.
p232_389|p232|It has moved on in the last week.
p232_174|p232|I always felt they played for me.
p232_160|p232|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p232_148|p232|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p232_107|p232|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p232_113|p232|It's not fair.
p232_305|p232|They are wrong.
p232_311|p232|Special measures were needed.
p232_339|p232|They haven't got a hope.
p232_271|p232|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p232_265|p232|Blood samples were taken.
p232_259|p232|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p232_098|p232|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p232_073|p232|There could be a way back.
p232_067|p232|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p232_066|p232|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p232_072|p232|That was the easy election.
p232_099|p232|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p232_258|p232|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p232_264|p232|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p232_270|p232|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p232_338|p232|The team for the first game could be this one.
p232_310|p232|He was solid.
p232_112|p232|You had better believe it.
p232_106|p232|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p232_110|p232|I don't have many friends.
p232_104|p232|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p232_138|p232|What will happen then?
p232_312|p232|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p232_306|p232|It is a road of death.
p232_299|p232|He has retired.
p232_266|p232|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p232_272|p232|He is a young man with a new deal.
p232_064|p232|People love to see this stuff.
p232_070|p232|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p232_058|p232|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p232_059|p232|That's the truth.
p232_071|p232|Painful, but only because it's true.
p232_065|p232|He was popular.
p232_273|p232|He was also married with two children.
p232_267|p232|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p232_298|p232|He should have won.
p232_307|p232|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p232_313|p232|I never thought it would take this long.
p232_139|p232|I am totally devoted to this job.
p232_105|p232|That is no use.
p232_111|p232|He was jailed for a year.
p232_129|p232|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p232_115|p232|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p232_101|p232|They were outside the circle.
p232_317|p232|Craig is a major concern for us.
p232_303|p232|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p232_288|p232|He looked very sharp.
p232_263|p232|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p232_277|p232|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p232_049|p232|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p232_061|p232|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p232_075|p232|The price cuts are really exciting.
p232_074|p232|Then followed a bout of flu.
p232_060|p232|That is very hard, alone.
p232_048|p232|But it might have done.
p232_276|p232|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p232_262|p232|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
p232_289|p232|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p232_302|p232|Nothing is safe.
p232_316|p232|It should be equal.
p232_100|p232|It was mayhem.
p232_114|p232|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p232_128|p232|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p232_102|p232|It was a good performance.
p232_116|p232|Maybe this battle has been.
p232_328|p232|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p232_300|p232|What has altered?
p232_314|p232|We are a peaceful people.
p232_248|p232|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p232_274|p232|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p232_260|p232|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p232_089|p232|Now the system is right behind us.
p232_076|p232|I had my suspicions.
p232_062|p232|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p232_063|p232|You do not change overnight.
p232_077|p232|It was chaotic.
p232_088|p232|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p232_261|p232|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p232_275|p232|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p232_249|p232|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p232_315|p232|Kids are terrible.
p232_301|p232|I thought it was my only chance.
p232_329|p232|We agreed to disagree.
p232_117|p232|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p232_103|p232|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p250_091|p250|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
p250_085|p250|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p250_278|p250|They are interior designers and architects.
p250_250|p250|She will attend in July.
p250_244|p250|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p250_293|p250|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p250_287|p250|Do I think about them often?
p250_318|p250|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p250_324|p250|Holland won by five wickets.
p250_442|p250|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p250_456|p250|But we have built a platform for next season.
p250_330|p250|Job losses were also announced.
p250_481|p250|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
p250_495|p250|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
p250_126|p250|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p250_132|p250|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p250_133|p250|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p250_127|p250|I understand the medical concerns.
p250_494|p250|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p250_480|p250|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p250_457|p250|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p250_331|p250|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p250_325|p250|There's still no-one like him.
p250_443|p250|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p250_319|p250|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p250_286|p250|What was the matter for concern?
p250_292|p250|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
p250_245|p250|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p250_251|p250|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p250_084|p250|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p250_090|p250|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
p250_047|p250|So is that it, then?
p250_053|p250|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p250_079|p250|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p250_045|p250|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p250_051|p250|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p250_086|p250|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p250_092|p250|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p250_247|p250|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p250_253|p250|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
p250_284|p250|And they were being paid?
p250_290|p250|I feel really confident in that department.
p250_469|p250|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p250_333|p250|The party lasted all night.
p250_455|p250|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p250_441|p250|There were a lot of emotions.
p250_327|p250|I was brought up in a mining background.
p250_496|p250|Subsidy income will not be affected.
p250_482|p250|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p250_119|p250|No, the equipment is extra.
p250_131|p250|He thought she was amazing.
p250_125|p250|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p250_124|p250|Before the game we went for a pint.
p250_130|p250|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p250_118|p250|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p250_483|p250|That argument has been won.
p250_440|p250|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p250_326|p250|McNaughton was not so sure.
p250_332|p250|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p250_454|p250|The removal would take place in France.
p250_468|p250|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
p250_291|p250|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p250_285|p250|was everything done to save people?
p250_252|p250|The most important thing is the game.
p250_246|p250|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p250_093|p250|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p250_087|p250|They lived for their children.
p250_050|p250|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p250_044|p250|I made a terrible start.
p250_078|p250|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p250_040|p250|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p250_054|p250|I had trouble with the producers.
p250_068|p250|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p250_083|p250|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p250_097|p250|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p250_242|p250|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p250_281|p250|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p250_295|p250|We shall rely on human beings.
p250_450|p250|And we might go back.
p250_336|p250|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p250_322|p250|The effect was almost magical.
p250_444|p250|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p250_478|p250|Well, he is an artist.
p250_493|p250|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p250_487|p250|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p250_134|p250|It isn't a happy memory.
p250_120|p250|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p250_108|p250|We knew they could do it.
p250_109|p250|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p250_121|p250|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
p250_135|p250|We have a team to reach the final.
p250_486|p250|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p250_492|p250|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p250_479|p250|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p250_323|p250|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p250_445|p250|Everything in golf is a balance.
p250_451|p250|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p250_337|p250|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
p250_294|p250|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p250_280|p250|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p250_257|p250|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p250_243|p250|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p250_096|p250|Why do it otherwise?
p250_082|p250|I've had it for the exams.
p250_069|p250|Only water is currently allowed.
p250_055|p250|The teacher would have approved.
p250_057|p250|I expect a rapid response.
p250_043|p250|This represents a tough game for us.
p250_094|p250|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p250_080|p250|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p250_255|p250|The right decision has been made.
p250_241|p250|That you can do it.
p250_269|p250|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p250_296|p250|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p250_282|p250|We are aiming for early March.
p250_447|p250|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
p250_321|p250|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p250_335|p250|It was nice to finish in style.
p250_453|p250|But you can go beyond that condition.
p250_309|p250|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p250_484|p250|It was a narrow escape.
p250_490|p250|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p250_123|p250|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p250_137|p250|She's got to say something.
p250_136|p250|Failure is not an option.
p250_491|p250|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p250_485|p250|And rugby fans can help.
p250_308|p250|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p250_334|p250|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p250_452|p250|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p250_446|p250|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p250_320|p250|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p250_283|p250|I felt about this big.
p250_297|p250|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
p250_268|p250|That was a disgraceful performance.
p250_240|p250|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p250_254|p250|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p250_081|p250|It makes for an interesting conference.
p250_095|p250|It is high time to act.
p250_042|p250|No meaningful response was issued.
p250_056|p250|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p250_019|p250|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p250_031|p250|We will not tolerate it.
p250_025|p250|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p250_233|p250|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p250_227|p250|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p250_409|p250|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p250_421|p250|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p250_353|p250|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p250_435|p250|No date has been fixed for his return.
p250_384|p250|They will fight for everything.
p250_390|p250|After the match, do you?
p250_179|p250|You will be very welcome.
p250_151|p250|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p250_186|p250|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p250_192|p250|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
p250_193|p250|They need to look after themselves.
p250_187|p250|This championship is different from the other majors.
p250_150|p250|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p250_144|p250|We did what we had to do.
p250_178|p250|I'd love to be like Peter.
p250_391|p250|The team hadn't been picked.
p250_385|p250|We will win the argument.
p250_352|p250|The pain is still acute.
p250_434|p250|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p250_420|p250|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p250_346|p250|He has made his base in Spain.
p250_408|p250|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p250_226|p250|Who was she?
p250_232|p250|It will affect their work.
p250_024|p250|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p250_030|p250|This is a central issue.
p250_018|p250|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p250_026|p250|Meetings will also remain private.
p250_032|p250|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p250_218|p250|It carried a double message.
p250_224|p250|What are you not good at?
p250_230|p250|My daughter is an adult.
p250_378|p250|She said they would appeal.
p250_436|p250|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p250_350|p250|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p250_344|p250|We will listen to any suggestion.
p250_422|p250|The BBC was a disgrace.
p250_393|p250|One-third of the places are already taken.
p250_387|p250|Does it matter?
p250_152|p250|We will try to find someone.
p250_146|p250|You've got to be vigilant.
p250_191|p250|Our fans have been marvellous.
p250_185|p250|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p250_184|p250|They could not match it.
p250_190|p250|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p250_147|p250|You are a gambling man.
p250_153|p250|She died at her home.
p250_386|p250|Is it worth it?
p250_392|p250|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p250_345|p250|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p250_423|p250|Russell is delighted with them.
p250_437|p250|The trial will open today.
p250_351|p250|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p250_379|p250|The countryside is in crisis.
p250_231|p250|His third goal was superb.
p250_225|p250|I think, therefore I am?
p250_219|p250|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p250_033|p250|He works at the airport.
p250_027|p250|I am pretty careful with money.
p250_023|p250|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p250_037|p250|Rugby has an extended run.
p250_221|p250|That might help a bit.
p250_235|p250|The process will start tomorrow.
p250_209|p250|It was a moment of madness.
p250_355|p250|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p250_433|p250|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
p250_427|p250|I am astonished at attack.
p250_341|p250|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p250_369|p250|He had no access to the database.
p250_396|p250|The marshall at the turn was great.
p250_382|p250|She is obviously very disappointed.
p250_157|p250|Why change it?
p250_143|p250|My life has changed a lot.
p250_194|p250|Miller was every bit as happy.
p250_180|p250|It had so much to do with output.
p250_181|p250|That would open the gates of hell.
p250_195|p250|They were seriously after him.
p250_142|p250|That is far too high.
p250_156|p250|Was it the wife?
p250_383|p250|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p250_397|p250|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p250_368|p250|We put our bid in last night.
p250_426|p250|The second goal was superb.
p250_340|p250|There will be good prospects ahead.
p250_354|p250|It's wonderful to have won.
p250_432|p250|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p250_208|p250|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
p250_234|p250|I am considered a teenager.
p250_220|p250|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p250_036|p250|It was just appalling luck.
p250_022|p250|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p250_034|p250|Smoking is also very important.
p250_020|p250|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p250_008|p250|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p250_236|p250|It's just a normal life.
p250_222|p250|Does the name matter?
p250_342|p250|The letters are going out today.
p250_424|p250|The next few months will tell.
p250_430|p250|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p250_356|p250|I'd like to take the plunge.
p250_418|p250|It is a large number.
p250_381|p250|It's as wide as a church in here.
p250_395|p250|Everyone could see the joke.
p250_140|p250|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p250_154|p250|What happened in that game?
p250_168|p250|The defender made an impressive debut.
p250_183|p250|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p250_197|p250|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p250_196|p250|It was a bit like having children.
p250_182|p250|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p250_169|p250|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p250_155|p250|Are you going to win?
p250_141|p250|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p250_394|p250|I always knew she was funny.
p250_380|p250|There is no deal as yet.
p250_419|p250|She started to put on weight.
p250_431|p250|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p250_357|p250|Finally came the moment of truth.
p250_343|p250|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p250_425|p250|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p250_223|p250|how do you get it back?
p250_237|p250|The transaction is not feasible.
p250_009|p250|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p250_021|p250|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p250_035|p250|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p250_038|p250|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p250_010|p250|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p250_004|p250|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p250_212|p250|It gave no further details.
p250_206|p250|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p250_428|p250|There is a solution, she believes.
p250_400|p250|There was a substantial explosion.
p250_366|p250|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p250_372|p250|They should take their mobile phones.
p250_414|p250|The choice is strictly personal.
p250_399|p250|The law would appear to be on our side.
p250_158|p250|What do we want to do that for?
p250_164|p250|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p250_170|p250|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p250_171|p250|They have not been named.
p250_165|p250|It has become a way of life.
p250_159|p250|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p250_398|p250|He has earned the right to their respect.
p250_415|p250|It's too close to call.
p250_401|p250|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p250_367|p250|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p250_429|p250|That was the agreement with the manager.
p250_207|p250|You could feel the heat.
p250_005|p250|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p250_011|p250|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p250_039|p250|Costs have got to be controlled.
p250_007|p250|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p250_013|p250|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p250_239|p250|It is good for our team.
p250_205|p250|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p250_211|p250|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p250_359|p250|Is our children learning?
p250_417|p250|It became a national network.
p250_371|p250|I was delighted to accept.
p250_365|p250|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p250_403|p250|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p250_173|p250|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
p250_167|p250|People were actually not on his side.
p250_198|p250|We represent a wide range of society.
p250_199|p250|He was rejected because he had retired.
p250_166|p250|The whole industry is a shambles.
p250_172|p250|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p250_364|p250|Three years ago he would have been.
p250_402|p250|Theatre is not a museum.
p250_416|p250|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p250_370|p250|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p250_358|p250|We have very limited capacity.
p250_210|p250|And we have the experience.
p250_204|p250|We are going through difficult times.
p250_238|p250|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p250_012|p250|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p250_006|p250|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p250_002|p250|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p250_016|p250|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p250_200|p250|We always felt we could win.
p250_214|p250|I won't make an official complaint.
p250_228|p250|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p250_374|p250|It's fantastic to win again.
p250_412|p250|Neither man has been charged.
p250_406|p250|Rugby is a hard game.
p250_360|p250|What form did that take?
p250_348|p250|A Home Office spokesman said.
p250_176|p250|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p250_162|p250|It is not just about pay.
p250_189|p250|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p250_188|p250|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p250_163|p250|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p250_177|p250|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p250_349|p250|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p250_407|p250|My immune system had been depleted.
p250_361|p250|Are they free?
p250_375|p250|We are really good friends.
p250_413|p250|I had a fortunate war.
p250_229|p250|It had all been arranged.
p250_215|p250|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p250_201|p250|It may have been a cry for help.
p250_017|p250|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p250_003|p250|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p250_015|p250|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p250_001|p250|Please call Stella.  
p250_217|p250|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p250_363|p250|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p250_405|p250|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p250_411|p250|We're not taking any risks.
p250_377|p250|Those people must be accountable.
p250_439|p250|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p250_388|p250|How do you take them away?
p250_161|p250|Life is still very tough for them.
p250_175|p250|He was asked to quit.
p250_149|p250|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p250_148|p250|I had decided to quit the show.
p250_174|p250|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p250_160|p250|He was pleased with his display.
p250_389|p250|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p250_438|p250|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
p250_410|p250|Growth will come later in the cycle.
p250_376|p250|The salary changes are long overdue.
p250_362|p250|Is there a waiting list?
p250_404|p250|It has only been rumours.
p250_202|p250|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p250_216|p250|It was worth a photograph.
p250_028|p250|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p250_014|p250|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p250_073|p250|It wasn't possible to relax.
p250_067|p250|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p250_098|p250|So, did she meet him?
p250_271|p250|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p250_265|p250|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p250_339|p250|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p250_305|p250|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
p250_463|p250|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p250_477|p250|The chief constable has retired.
p250_311|p250|Stephen will get his first cap.
p250_488|p250|The Israeli military denied the claim.
p250_107|p250|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p250_113|p250|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p250_106|p250|We have made no final decisions.
p250_489|p250|He is not a dancer.
p250_476|p250|I have always believed in myself.
p250_310|p250|You have to expect this type of thing.
p250_304|p250|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p250_462|p250|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p250_338|p250|And he goes with it.
p250_264|p250|He is a reporter for us.
p250_270|p250|It was a kind of contempt.
p250_258|p250|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p250_099|p250|So what is the campaign about?
p250_066|p250|We will pay their bills.
p250_072|p250|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p250_058|p250|She said she was really sorry.
p250_064|p250|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
p250_070|p250|I am about protecting the state pension.
p250_266|p250|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p250_272|p250|I should think so, too.
p250_299|p250|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p250_448|p250|The people around me were fantastic.
p250_312|p250|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p250_474|p250|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
p250_460|p250|It was like someone had died.
p250_306|p250|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p250_138|p250|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p250_110|p250|They must be on commission.
p250_104|p250|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p250_105|p250|He was released after treatment.
p250_111|p250|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p250_139|p250|This is a frightening development.
p250_461|p250|The budget was too low for that.
p250_313|p250|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p250_475|p250|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p250_449|p250|That will be best for him.
p250_298|p250|He has not created a Festival resource.
p250_273|p250|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p250_267|p250|We've had several problems over injuries.
p250_071|p250|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p250_065|p250|This is the first step.
p250_059|p250|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p250_061|p250|Let's hope that it does.
p250_075|p250|There's nothing they can get on me.
p250_049|p250|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p250_263|p250|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p250_277|p250|We accept the new rules.
p250_288|p250|Is it in the right place?
p250_471|p250|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
p250_317|p250|He will address the nation this evening.
p250_465|p250|Let that be their memorial.
p250_459|p250|The jury is still out.
p250_115|p250|It's good to have a voice.
p250_101|p250|Are you from the rugby?
p250_129|p250|I have learned from him.
p250_128|p250|That's not an assumption that I had made.
p250_100|p250|And does it?
p250_114|p250|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p250_458|p250|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p250_302|p250|It was an easy decision to come here.
p250_464|p250|The damage is all inside.
p250_316|p250|I wanted to change the formula.
p250_289|p250|It is also very valuable.
p250_276|p250|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p250_262|p250|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p250_048|p250|Do I have a favourite?
p250_074|p250|We need to increase the membership.
p250_060|p250|There's still plenty time left.
p250_076|p250|I was as strong as a horse.
p250_062|p250|We have to keep our clients.
p250_089|p250|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
p250_274|p250|Messages have to be reinforced.
p250_260|p250|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p250_248|p250|I have spoken to the skipper.
p250_466|p250|The boys are mentally focused.
p250_300|p250|I understand the security issue.
p250_314|p250|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p250_472|p250|He certainly did a good job!
p250_328|p250|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p250_102|p250|Had I heard?
p250_116|p250|He was prepared for this.
p250_117|p250|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p250_103|p250|It is an old family habit.
p250_329|p250|The takeover comes as no surprise.
p250_315|p250|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p250_473|p250|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
p250_467|p250|This is the stuff of live music.
p250_301|p250|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p250_249|p250|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p250_261|p250|He was good, but not that good.
p250_275|p250|I got a yellow card.
p250_088|p250|Potions said he would drive.
p250_063|p250|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p250_077|p250|He was a lovely man.
p268_167|p268|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p268_371|p268|He looked at me before replying.
p268_365|p268|There was an element of frustration.
p268_403|p268|We're looking for unity in the council.
p268_359|p268|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p268_205|p268|McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
p268_211|p268|Bottling is now the core business.
p268_239|p268|Did it work?
p268_007|p268|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p268_013|p268|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p268_012|p268|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p268_006|p268|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p268_238|p268|Does that put pressure on us?
p268_210|p268|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p268_204|p268|The refund is fully justified.
p268_358|p268|We played them off the pitch.
p268_364|p268|This would include the GM food industry.
p268_402|p268|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p268_370|p268|He ended up a headmaster.
p268_166|p268|They exist in name alone.
p268_172|p268|Do I think about them often?
p268_199|p268|This Patton will also return.
p268_164|p268|And so the cycle continues.
p268_170|p268|I can see it now.
p268_158|p268|Before the game we went for a pint.
p268_399|p268|It seems to have worked.
p268_400|p268|We have no information on Iraq.
p268_366|p268|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p268_372|p268|I have little time for analysts.
p268_212|p268|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p268_206|p268|We believe a third party was involved.
p268_010|p268|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p268_004|p268|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p268_038|p268|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p268_039|p268|How are you, sir?
p268_005|p268|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p268_011|p268|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p268_207|p268|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p268_213|p268|I enjoy the creative process.
p268_373|p268|I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
p268_401|p268|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p268_367|p268|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p268_398|p268|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p268_171|p268|What was the matter for concern?
p268_165|p268|But the relief was short-lived.
p268_149|p268|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p268_161|p268|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p268_175|p268|There's still plenty time left.
p268_388|p268|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p268_363|p268|The performance continues to improve.
p268_405|p268|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p268_411|p268|The capital costs are modest.
p268_377|p268|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p268_217|p268|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
p268_203|p268|There was a fine line to tread.
p268_029|p268|The first appeared to be successful.
p268_015|p268|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p268_001|p268|Please call Stella.  
p268_014|p268|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p268_028|p268|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
p268_202|p268|It is all to do with the coaching.
p268_216|p268|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p268_410|p268|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p268_376|p268|My wife and family are the support system.
p268_362|p268|The statement contained no surprises.
p268_404|p268|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p268_389|p268|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p268_174|p268|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p268_160|p268|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p268_148|p268|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p268_189|p268|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p268_176|p268|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p268_162|p268|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p268_348|p268|Have I really come to this?
p268_374|p268|That remains the unanswered question.
p268_406|p268|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p268_360|p268|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p268_228|p268|There's always the next century.
p268_200|p268|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p268_214|p268|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p268_002|p268|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p268_016|p268|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p268_017|p268|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p268_003|p268|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p268_215|p268|The whole thing was just unreal.
p268_201|p268|You are a gambling man.
p268_229|p268|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p268_407|p268|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p268_361|p268|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p268_375|p268|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p268_349|p268|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p268_163|p268|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p268_177|p268|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p268_188|p268|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p268_110|p268|Instead, another depression came in.
p268_104|p268|He will be kept informed.
p268_138|p268|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p268_312|p268|Everyone can have their opinion.
p268_306|p268|It caused a lot of upset.
p268_299|p268|It has been recorded twice.
p268_266|p268|We believe in the medium term.
p268_272|p268|I came up through the ranks.
p268_064|p268|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p268_070|p268|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
p268_058|p268|It was just too much for us.
p268_059|p268|Perhaps we should do the same.
p268_071|p268|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p268_065|p268|He will need that machine.
p268_273|p268|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
p268_267|p268|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p268_298|p268|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p268_307|p268|I saw them last week.
p268_313|p268|I was inspired by two things.
p268_139|p268|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p268_105|p268|Maybe this battle has been.
p268_111|p268|Even the one she loved.
p268_107|p268|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p268_113|p268|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p268_305|p268|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p268_311|p268|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p268_339|p268|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p268_271|p268|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p268_265|p268|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p268_259|p268|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p268_098|p268|Are you from the rugby?
p268_073|p268|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p268_067|p268|I would not say that.
p268_066|p268|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p268_072|p268|We deserved the three points.
p268_099|p268|Had I heard?
p268_258|p268|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p268_264|p268|The planning appears to have paid off.
p268_270|p268|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p268_338|p268|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p268_310|p268|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p268_304|p268|They will probably come back.
p268_112|p268|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p268_106|p268|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p268_102|p268|You should try to have a laugh.
p268_116|p268|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p268_328|p268|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p268_300|p268|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p268_314|p268|It was a lovely sunset.
p268_248|p268|This is absolutely not true.
p268_274|p268|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p268_260|p268|We have a budget in March.
p268_089|p268|It was exactly four months away.
p268_076|p268|But the organisers refused to worry.
p268_062|p268|He looks like an Afghan.
p268_063|p268|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p268_077|p268|We have to keep our clients.
p268_088|p268|It is time for new ways for the church.
p268_261|p268|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
p268_275|p268|They made such decisions in London.
p268_249|p268|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p268_315|p268|Movie stars are public property.
p268_301|p268|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p268_329|p268|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p268_117|p268|Those people must be accountable.
p268_103|p268|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p268_129|p268|It wasn't possible to relax.
p268_115|p268|Everything else is a bonus.
p268_101|p268|Are you going to win?
p268_317|p268|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
p268_303|p268|I'm interested in interesting work.
p268_288|p268|Are they free?
p268_263|p268|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
p268_277|p268|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p268_049|p268|The latter option was chosen.
p268_061|p268|Everything is possible in football.
p268_075|p268|Let's hope that it does.
p268_074|p268|I am relishing the challenge.
p268_060|p268|They desperately want some stability.
p268_048|p268|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p268_276|p268|Clearly, they had other problems.
p268_262|p268|You had to go and see him.
p268_289|p268|What are they for?
p268_302|p268|This youngster is so exciting!
p268_316|p268|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p268_100|p268|What happened in that game?
p268_114|p268|Well, he is an artist.
p268_128|p268|Their season has been consigned to history.
p268_131|p268|But then they scored their fourth.
p268_125|p268|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p268_119|p268|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p268_333|p268|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p268_327|p268|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p268_284|p268|Injuries have taken their toll.
p268_290|p268|Is there a waiting list?
p268_247|p268|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p268_253|p268|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p268_086|p268|He's not getting into any games.
p268_092|p268|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
p268_045|p268|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p268_051|p268|The man became a reporter.
p268_079|p268|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
p268_078|p268|We should be able to cope.
p268_050|p268|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p268_044|p268|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
p268_093|p268|Final proposals will be published in February.
p268_087|p268|We will pay their bills.
p268_252|p268|I've come here for the jersey.
p268_246|p268|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p268_291|p268|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p268_285|p268|Says the Duke of York.
p268_326|p268|I won't make an official complaint.
p268_332|p268|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p268_118|p268|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p268_124|p268|We shall rely on human beings.
p268_130|p268|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p268_126|p268|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p268_132|p268|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p268_324|p268|It was his own decision.
p268_330|p268|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p268_318|p268|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p268_293|p268|The Royal Highland was no exception.
p268_287|p268|What form did that take?
p268_250|p268|They should stop the bombing.
p268_244|p268|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p268_278|p268|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p268_091|p268|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p268_085|p268|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p268_052|p268|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p268_046|p268|Something has to give sometime.
p268_047|p268|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p268_053|p268|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
p268_084|p268|Kenny Miller might come through.
p268_090|p268|I am glad I wasn't in it.
p268_279|p268|Phase one was a shambles.
p268_245|p268|There was no basis for their arrest.
p268_251|p268|These days are long gone.
p268_286|p268|How independent is that?
p268_292|p268|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p268_319|p268|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p268_331|p268|We have an election in eight days.
p268_325|p268|You are a great player.
p268_133|p268|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p268_127|p268|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
p268_123|p268|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p268_137|p268|All the employees are redundant.
p268_309|p268|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p268_321|p268|It gave me something to focus on.
p268_335|p268|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p268_296|p268|They need to be involved.
p268_282|p268|A winter of discontent awaits.
p268_269|p268|They could not match it.
p268_255|p268|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p268_241|p268|It would seem a natural progression.
p268_094|p268|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p268_080|p268|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p268_057|p268|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p268_043|p268|Why do it otherwise?
p268_042|p268|What do we do?
p268_056|p268|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p268_081|p268|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p268_095|p268|So, did she meet him?
p268_240|p268|Do you think we are a top nation?
p268_254|p268|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p268_268|p268|They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
p268_283|p268|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
p268_297|p268|We've had great things in the past.
p268_334|p268|Walker plans to return indoors.
p268_320|p268|And we have the experience.
p268_308|p268|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p268_122|p268|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p268_108|p268|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
p268_134|p268|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p268_120|p268|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p268_336|p268|The only problem was the greens.
p268_322|p268|The result is utterly compelling.
p268_295|p268|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p268_242|p268|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p268_256|p268|It's never great to finish second.
p268_083|p268|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p268_097|p268|And does it?
p268_068|p268|This was a far cry from his election pledges.
p268_040|p268|So is that it, then?
p268_054|p268|Among them are many criminals.
p268_055|p268|I knew my contract was up this year.
p268_041|p268|Do I have a favourite?
p268_069|p268|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p268_096|p268|So what is the campaign about?
p268_082|p268|But I had never been in a theatre.
p268_257|p268|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p268_243|p268|We will turn the corner.
p268_294|p268|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p268_280|p268|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p268_323|p268|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p268_337|p268|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p268_121|p268|Or so the story goes.
p268_135|p268|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p268_109|p268|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p268_191|p268|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p268_185|p268|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p268_152|p268|We're not taking any risks.
p268_146|p268|Does the name matter?
p268_393|p268|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p268_387|p268|I have received no explanation.
p268_350|p268|I am considered a teenager.
p268_344|p268|Does it matter?
p268_378|p268|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p268_224|p268|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p268_230|p268|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p268_218|p268|That group reported just before Christmas.
p268_026|p268|He got very close tonight.
p268_032|p268|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p268_033|p268|Further management changes are planned.
p268_027|p268|Smoking is also very important.
p268_219|p268|We had to add value.
p268_231|p268|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p268_225|p268|So I got a blood test.
p268_379|p268|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p268_345|p268|How do you take them away?
p268_351|p268|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p268_386|p268|We were beaten by the better team.
p268_392|p268|Potions said he would drive.
p268_147|p268|how do you get it back?
p268_153|p268|It's very dangerous for markets.
p268_184|p268|His job was not advertised.
p268_190|p268|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p268_186|p268|That was just one night.
p268_192|p268|This is a frightening development.
p268_145|p268|What do we want to do that for?
p268_151|p268|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p268_179|p268|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p268_384|p268|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p268_390|p268|And it had two seats.
p268_347|p268|After the match, do you?
p268_353|p268|Instead, he missed the lot.
p268_409|p268|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p268_233|p268|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p268_227|p268|He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
p268_031|p268|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p268_025|p268|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p268_019|p268|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p268_018|p268|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p268_024|p268|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p268_030|p268|We must convince the citizens.
p268_226|p268|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p268_232|p268|Years ago it was really quite simple.
p268_408|p268|I should think so, too.
p268_352|p268|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p268_346|p268|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p268_391|p268|This is a load of nonsense.
p268_385|p268|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p268_178|p268|We are happy with the referee.
p268_150|p268|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p268_144|p268|He was forced to quit.
p268_193|p268|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p268_187|p268|My father died in childbirth.
p268_183|p268|The hearing was due to continue today.
p268_197|p268|You've got to be vigilant.
p268_168|p268|We have reacted well to each other.
p268_140|p268|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p268_154|p268|That's what happened against Ayr.
p268_381|p268|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p268_395|p268|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p268_342|p268|Plans were made to expand.
p268_356|p268|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p268_236|p268|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p268_222|p268|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p268_034|p268|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p268_020|p268|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p268_021|p268|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p268_035|p268|It's as we were yesterday.
p268_009|p268|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p268_223|p268|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p268_237|p268|And they removed a Borderer.
p268_357|p268|William Hague delighted his party.
p268_343|p268|My daughter is an adult.
p268_394|p268|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p268_380|p268|Those overseas offices were great.
p268_155|p268|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
p268_141|p268|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p268_169|p268|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p268_196|p268|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p268_182|p268|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p268_194|p268|Lee Westwood has other ideas.
p268_180|p268|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p268_157|p268|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p268_143|p268|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p268_396|p268|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p268_382|p268|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p268_369|p268|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p268_355|p268|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p268_341|p268|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p268_209|p268|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p268_221|p268|My players have no idea about football.
p268_235|p268|They've got some extremely good players.
p268_037|p268|He works at the airport.
p268_036|p268|We are opening an inquiry.
p268_022|p268|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p268_234|p268|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p268_220|p268|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p268_208|p268|It would make a lot of sense.
p268_340|p268|Twaddle is a case in point.
p268_354|p268|Laura is an investment banker.
p268_368|p268|Weather should not be a factor.
p268_383|p268|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p268_397|p268|You can feel at home in China.
p268_142|p268|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p268_156|p268|The following are the principal provisions.
p268_181|p268|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p268_195|p268|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p257_204|p257|He knows a lot.
p257_012|p257|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p257_006|p257|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p257_199|p257|IT S all in the hair.
p257_166|p257|You are not going in blind.
p257_172|p257|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p257_358|p257|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p257_364|p257|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p257_402|p257|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p257_416|p257|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p257_370|p257|However, it's good to turn the page.
p257_417|p257|War is not the action.
p257_371|p257|This year I understood.
p257_365|p257|YOU thought it was a headache.
p257_403|p257|It doesn't always work that way.
p257_359|p257|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p257_173|p257|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p257_167|p257|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p257_198|p257|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p257_007|p257|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p257_013|p257|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p257_205|p257|He is slightly confused.
p257_211|p257|We have got to get it right.
p257_239|p257|You can feel at home in China.
p257_207|p257|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p257_213|p257|I might come back.
p257_039|p257|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p257_005|p257|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p257_011|p257|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p257_159|p257|He can do no wrong.
p257_171|p257|There was no hint of scandal.
p257_165|p257|I lost my head.
p257_398|p257|I was very young.
p257_429|p257|It's a miracle.
p257_373|p257|It is unusual.
p257_415|p257|We shall be victorious.
p257_401|p257|She is superb.
p257_367|p257|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p257_400|p257|I am the Son of Sam.
p257_366|p257|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p257_372|p257|I'm pleased about one thing.
p257_414|p257|I have so much respect for him.
p257_428|p257|It had been in place since last July.
p257_399|p257|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p257_164|p257|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p257_170|p257|My life has been destroyed.
p257_158|p257|There's a pause.
p257_010|p257|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p257_004|p257|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p257_038|p257|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p257_212|p257|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p257_206|p257|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p257_202|p257|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p257_216|p257|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p257_014|p257|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p257_028|p257|Because we do not need it.
p257_174|p257|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p257_160|p257|It was so new, so exciting.
p257_148|p257|It is like a football team.
p257_389|p257|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p257_410|p257|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p257_376|p257|I can lead by example.
p257_362|p257|He denied the charge.
p257_404|p257|It is simple, but profound.
p257_363|p257|There were no casualties.
p257_405|p257|No preference emerged.
p257_411|p257|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p257_377|p257|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p257_388|p257|You ask the question.
p257_149|p257|That group reported just before Christmas.
p257_161|p257|I've learned from my mistakes.
p257_175|p257|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p257_029|p257|Life was like a timetable.
p257_015|p257|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p257_001|p257|Please call Stella.  
p257_217|p257|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p257_203|p257|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p257_215|p257|It's just a place to open it.
p257_201|p257|But I am a worried man.
p257_229|p257|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p257_017|p257|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p257_003|p257|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p257_188|p257|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p257_163|p257|I've put my own money into this project.
p257_177|p257|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p257_407|p257|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p257_361|p257|He has the edge.
p257_375|p257|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
p257_413|p257|We are delighted with this outcome.
p257_349|p257|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p257_348|p257|He could face a jail sentence.
p257_374|p257|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p257_412|p257|I recommend a tour.
p257_406|p257|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p257_360|p257|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
p257_176|p257|It's quite a routine.
p257_162|p257|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p257_189|p257|Last night was a key episode.
p257_002|p257|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p257_016|p257|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p257_228|p257|It is set in Paris.
p257_200|p257|We have an election in eight days.
p257_214|p257|His death was a tragic accident.
p257_298|p257|This is the culture change in medicine.
p257_273|p257|You've got to have both sides.
p257_267|p257|One knows the feeling.
p257_059|p257|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p257_071|p257|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p257_065|p257|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p257_139|p257|What will happen then?
p257_105|p257|I didn't play well last year.
p257_111|p257|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p257_307|p257|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p257_313|p257|I came into this world with nothing.
p257_312|p257|We are in the end game.
p257_306|p257|It should be equal.
p257_110|p257|It is normal.
p257_104|p257|That time is not now, however.
p257_138|p257|It is also well received.
p257_064|p257|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p257_070|p257|The price cuts are really exciting.
p257_058|p257|It is not great art.
p257_266|p257|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p257_272|p257|He looked very sharp.
p257_299|p257|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p257_258|p257|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p257_264|p257|We're in shock.
p257_270|p257|It was a privilege to work for him.
p257_099|p257|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p257_066|p257|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p257_072|p257|I had my suspicions.
p257_112|p257|I don't have many friends.
p257_106|p257|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p257_338|p257|The salary changes are long overdue.
p257_310|p257|They had a confession.
p257_304|p257|Kids are terrible.
p257_305|p257|Henman has been warned.
p257_311|p257|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p257_339|p257|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p257_107|p257|They will want to perform well.
p257_113|p257|It's a shame.
p257_073|p257|She died in hospital two hours later.
p257_067|p257|It's all I can do.
p257_098|p257|They are now divorced.
p257_271|p257|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p257_265|p257|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p257_259|p257|It's very nice.
p257_261|p257|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p257_275|p257|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p257_249|p257|I watched a game.
p257_088|p257|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p257_063|p257|Have a look at our accounts.
p257_077|p257|People must remain vigilant.
p257_117|p257|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p257_103|p257|We have every respect for Michelle.
p257_315|p257|I am so upset.
p257_301|p257|I never thought it would take this long.
p257_329|p257|We must do something.
p257_328|p257|I'm very lucky.
p257_300|p257|They were fantastic.
p257_314|p257|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p257_102|p257|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p257_116|p257|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p257_076|p257|I've not thought about it.
p257_062|p257|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p257_089|p257|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p257_248|p257|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p257_274|p257|Who did the recruiting?
p257_260|p257|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p257_289|p257|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p257_276|p257|Well, he can do it.
p257_262|p257|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p257_074|p257|It was chaotic.
p257_060|p257|There was a battle there.
p257_048|p257|As she explains.
p257_100|p257|It was mayhem.
p257_114|p257|It was the eighties.
p257_128|p257|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p257_302|p257|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p257_316|p257|The boat was fantastic.
p257_317|p257|I saw some good things.
p257_303|p257|They wanted the club to make money.
p257_129|p257|So the European elections are extremely important.
p257_115|p257|We do not expect any surplus.
p257_101|p257|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p257_049|p257|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p257_061|p257|Scotland had great assets.
p257_075|p257|Is there a new way forward?
p257_263|p257|And Michael was just great.
p257_277|p257|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p257_288|p257|I thought it was my only chance.
p257_291|p257|They are wrong.
p257_285|p257|What has altered?
p257_252|p257|they fail to engage.
p257_246|p257|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p257_093|p257|He was possessed
p257_087|p257|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p257_078|p257|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p257_050|p257|He had no enemies.
p257_044|p257|I hate the word.
p257_118|p257|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p257_124|p257|That's all right then.
p257_130|p257|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p257_326|p257|I've got no secret.
p257_332|p257|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p257_333|p257|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p257_327|p257|Look at the witnesses.
p257_131|p257|Who will attend?
p257_125|p257|I was furious.
p257_119|p257|I'm delighted about that.
p257_045|p257|That should do it.
p257_051|p257|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p257_079|p257|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p257_086|p257|It's never too late.
p257_092|p257|It is an old family habit.
p257_247|p257|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p257_253|p257|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p257_284|p257|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p257_290|p257|It just came into my head that day.
p257_286|p257|The home was now under new management.
p257_292|p257|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p257_279|p257|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p257_245|p257|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p257_251|p257|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p257_084|p257|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p257_090|p257|Today I couldn't run on it.
p257_047|p257|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p257_053|p257|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p257_133|p257|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p257_127|p257|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p257_319|p257|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p257_331|p257|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p257_325|p257|Indeed, it was magical.
p257_324|p257|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p257_330|p257|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p257_318|p257|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p257_126|p257|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p257_132|p257|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p257_052|p257|But the law is very clear on this.
p257_046|p257|It's a blessing.
p257_091|p257|We must look forward.
p257_085|p257|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p257_250|p257|They are interior designers and architects.
p257_244|p257|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p257_278|p257|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p257_293|p257|It's just not funny!
p257_287|p257|Graeme was prepared.
p257_283|p257|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p257_297|p257|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p257_240|p257|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p257_254|p257|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p257_268|p257|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p257_081|p257|It may well have been.
p257_095|p257|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p257_042|p257|We need to chat.
p257_056|p257|It's very odd.
p257_136|p257|They made such decisions in London.
p257_122|p257|He did his job.
p257_334|p257|It is not like working for a living.
p257_320|p257|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p257_308|p257|The home team had an amazing start.
p257_309|p257|It is out there.
p257_321|p257|Three years ago he would have been.
p257_335|p257|It is long gone.
p257_123|p257|You can spend money on housing.
p257_137|p257|Our intentions are real.
p257_057|p257|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p257_043|p257|The boy is no longer with us.
p257_094|p257|She told The Herald.
p257_080|p257|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p257_269|p257|She looked so young.
p257_255|p257|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p257_241|p257|I should think so, too.
p257_296|p257|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p257_282|p257|A new school will be built.
p257_294|p257|I am very happy to be here.
p257_280|p257|The results are sometimes contentious.
p257_257|p257|Blood samples were taken.
p257_243|p257|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p257_096|p257|The peace process will be buried!
p257_082|p257|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p257_055|p257|Next league matches Celtic.
p257_041|p257|A neighbour said.
p257_069|p257|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p257_121|p257|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p257_135|p257|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p257_109|p257|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p257_323|p257|It is so unfair.
p257_337|p257|Tell us about it.
p257_336|p257|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p257_322|p257|You feel the pride.
p257_108|p257|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p257_134|p257|I am now unemployed.
p257_120|p257|Does this mean.
p257_068|p257|There could be a way back.
p257_040|p257|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p257_054|p257|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p257_083|p257|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p257_097|p257|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p257_242|p257|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p257_256|p257|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p257_281|p257|He should have won.
p257_295|p257|The plot is minimal.
p257_219|p257|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p257_231|p257|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p257_225|p257|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p257_033|p257|I came to complete.
p257_027|p257|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p257_184|p257|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p257_190|p257|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p257_147|p257|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p257_153|p257|It became a book by itself.
p257_386|p257|He's already made history.
p257_392|p257|Not because they want to sing about something.
p257_379|p257|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p257_345|p257|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p257_423|p257|They should not be blamed for it.
p257_351|p257|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p257_350|p257|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p257_344|p257|I wanted to go out on a high.
p257_422|p257|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p257_378|p257|They are good.
p257_393|p257|It is not a standing army.
p257_387|p257|So I did.
p257_152|p257|They did very well.
p257_146|p257|There is a lack of chemistry.
p257_191|p257|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p257_185|p257|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p257_026|p257|Is this accurate?
p257_032|p257|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p257_224|p257|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p257_230|p257|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p257_218|p257|William Hague delighted his party.
p257_226|p257|Broke the birdie record.
p257_232|p257|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
p257_018|p257|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p257_024|p257|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p257_030|p257|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p257_193|p257|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p257_187|p257|Saturday is gone.
p257_178|p257|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p257_150|p257|He will emerge as a world leader.
p257_144|p257|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p257_391|p257|This is a huge confidence boost.
p257_385|p257|Emotions were complex.
p257_408|p257|She has reached the top of her profession.
p257_352|p257|Then followed a bout of flu.
p257_434|p257|The bill would be massive.
p257_420|p257|One must hope not!
p257_346|p257|I felt really good until Friday.
p257_421|p257|It is marvellous.
p257_347|p257|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p257_353|p257|There is no signature.
p257_409|p257|It goes with the job.
p257_384|p257|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p257_390|p257|There was no trouble.
p257_145|p257|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p257_151|p257|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p257_179|p257|Everyone can be bought.
p257_186|p257|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p257_192|p257|Off I went.
p257_031|p257|It was clear.
p257_025|p257|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p257_019|p257|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p257_233|p257|But it's a subtle process.
p257_227|p257|They had no children.
p257_223|p257|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p257_237|p257|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p257_021|p257|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p257_035|p257|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p257_009|p257|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p257_196|p257|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p257_182|p257|What has caused the demise of singing?
p257_155|p257|The weather forecast isn't good.
p257_141|p257|I feel very grateful with everything.
p257_169|p257|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p257_394|p257|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p257_380|p257|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p257_431|p257|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p257_357|p257|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p257_343|p257|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p257_425|p257|It is bizarre.
p257_419|p257|It's not about defining styles.
p257_418|p257|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p257_342|p257|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p257_424|p257|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p257_430|p257|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
p257_356|p257|He knew his job inside out.
p257_381|p257|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p257_395|p257|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p257_168|p257|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p257_140|p257|It's not true.
p257_154|p257|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p257_183|p257|One was a lawyer.
p257_197|p257|It's just awful.
p257_008|p257|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p257_034|p257|President Bush is at war.
p257_020|p257|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p257_236|p257|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p257_222|p257|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p257_234|p257|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p257_220|p257|We played them off the pitch.
p257_208|p257|I am delighted for Simon.
p257_036|p257|I was scared.
p257_022|p257|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p257_181|p257|They need to look after themselves.
p257_195|p257|Ferguson should take note.
p257_142|p257|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p257_156|p257|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p257_383|p257|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p257_397|p257|Our numbers are small.
p257_426|p257|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p257_340|p257|It was very formal.
p257_354|p257|It's a long process.
p257_432|p257|They will form a tribute.
p257_368|p257|They really did a great job.
p257_369|p257|There is a solution, she believes.
p257_355|p257|It is a large number.
p257_433|p257|The whole region is in shock.
p257_427|p257|I was just overwhelmed.
p257_341|p257|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p257_396|p257|You wanted the evidence.
p257_382|p257|It was on fire.
p257_157|p257|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p257_143|p257|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p257_194|p257|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p257_180|p257|It is minute.
p257_023|p257|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p257_037|p257|It was ugly.
p257_209|p257|It had all been arranged.
p257_221|p257|She really suffered for her art.
p257_235|p257|My future is in the marathon.
p295_005|p295|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p295_011|p295|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p295_039|p295|I think he was nervous to begin with.
p295_171|p295|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p295_165|p295|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
p295_159|p295|I feel alive and good today.
p295_398|p295|It was very lucky no-one was killed.
p295_373|p295|The voices told me to do it.
p295_415|p295|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p295_401|p295|That is not a position they enjoy.
p295_367|p295|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p295_400|p295|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
p295_366|p295|I decided not to renew the contract.
p295_372|p295|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p295_414|p295|How do we get more people in?
p295_399|p295|What has caused the demise of singing?
p295_158|p295|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p295_164|p295|The voters are our masters.
p295_170|p295|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p295_038|p295|That means an extra two years.
p295_010|p295|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p295_004|p295|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p295_212|p295|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p295_206|p295|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p295_210|p295|And what is she escaping from?
p295_204|p295|That's why he is a national treasure.
p295_238|p295|The party will make up its own mind.
p295_012|p295|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p295_006|p295|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p295_199|p295|My intentions are to go on like this.
p295_166|p295|He is willing to pay the required amount.
p295_172|p295|You're not going to forget something like that.
p295_364|p295|But no decision has been made.
p295_402|p295|Blair also had a penalty.
p295_416|p295|There is too much at stake for that.
p295_370|p295|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p295_358|p295|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p295_359|p295|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p295_371|p295|She makes me feel very proud.
p295_365|p295|Our traditions and culture remain the same.
p295_403|p295|We wanted to run away with her.
p295_173|p295|They are in the euro.
p295_167|p295|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p295_198|p295|At least two women were among those arrested.
p295_007|p295|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p295_013|p295|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p295_239|p295|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p295_205|p295|It seems a waste of talents.
p295_211|p295|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
p295_229|p295|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p295_215|p295|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p295_201|p295|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p295_017|p295|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p295_003|p295|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p295_188|p295|She is still very poorly.
p295_163|p295|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p295_177|p295|A bit of match fitness is required.
p295_349|p295|No one wants to go through these things.
p295_407|p295|Boy is the town a mess.
p295_361|p295|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p295_375|p295|There is no point in looking any further.
p295_413|p295|This is a really serious issue.
p295_374|p295|I am a committed European.
p295_412|p295|That can happen so easily.
p295_406|p295|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p295_360|p295|But that is entirely a matter for them.
p295_348|p295|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p295_176|p295|It's all about money, money, money.
p295_162|p295|David Trimble has sold out.
p295_189|p295|That's how he did the damage.
p295_002|p295|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p295_016|p295|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p295_200|p295|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p295_214|p295|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
p295_228|p295|Not so, it transpires.
p295_202|p295|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p295_216|p295|I don't know how they make the weight.
p295_028|p295|Because we do not need it.
p295_014|p295|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p295_148|p295|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p295_174|p295|The driver was unhurt.
p295_160|p295|We're in England for the time being.
p295_389|p295|The team is in division one in Spain.
p295_410|p295|To me, it was just a miracle.
p295_376|p295|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p295_362|p295|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
p295_404|p295|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p295_363|p295|You're not going to get hurt.
p295_405|p295|I am not retiring.
p295_411|p295|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p295_377|p295|I'm astonished by this decision.
p295_388|p295|Things were not easy from the outset.
p295_161|p295|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p295_175|p295|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p295_149|p295|I can't say that this is very usual.
p295_015|p295|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p295_029|p295|It has been supremely successful.
p295_217|p295|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p295_203|p295|It's like an extension of your body.
p295_264|p295|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p295_270|p295|Whether this return was too soon.
p295_258|p295|This is your country.
p295_099|p295|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p295_066|p295|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p295_072|p295|I had no choice but to leave.
p295_112|p295|It is reform in return for resources.
p295_106|p295|This has been a terrible experience.
p295_310|p295|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p295_304|p295|I love this tournament.
p295_338|p295|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p295_339|p295|However, that could alter following the latest case.
p295_305|p295|Nobody will be forced to work.
p295_311|p295|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p295_107|p295|He had a different agenda entirely.
p295_113|p295|It offers a different viewpoint.
p295_073|p295|Where does he go from here?
p295_067|p295|And he listens to his artists as well.
p295_098|p295|The time of judgment has arrived.
p295_259|p295|That's the most important thing for me.
p295_271|p295|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p295_265|p295|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p295_298|p295|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
p295_273|p295|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p295_267|p295|However, the groups denied the claims.
p295_071|p295|We would have looked out for each other.
p295_065|p295|Can you imagine a world without design?
p295_059|p295|I knew there was a challenge for me.
p295_105|p295|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p295_111|p295|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p295_139|p295|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p295_307|p295|It is good for Europe.
p295_313|p295|I think they are right to be impatient.
p295_312|p295|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p295_306|p295|We're all going to take a holiday.
p295_138|p295|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p295_110|p295|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p295_104|p295|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p295_058|p295|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p295_064|p295|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p295_070|p295|He's right up to a point.
p295_266|p295|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p295_272|p295|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p295_299|p295|Could they perhaps be related?
p295_289|p295|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p295_276|p295|Manchester United are the classic example.
p295_262|p295|The committees are due to report next year.
p295_048|p295|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p295_074|p295|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p295_060|p295|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p295_128|p295|We will provide immediate access.
p295_100|p295|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p295_114|p295|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p295_302|p295|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p295_316|p295|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p295_317|p295|It's a member of your family.
p295_303|p295|They know their son was murdered.
p295_115|p295|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p295_101|p295|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p295_129|p295|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p295_061|p295|I just have no maternal instincts.
p295_075|p295|This time, there were no such rewards.
p295_049|p295|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p295_263|p295|It was seriously unpleasant.
p295_277|p295|I've never regretted my decision.
p295_288|p295|WE live in a world of large numbers.
p295_249|p295|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p295_261|p295|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p295_275|p295|My view has now completely changed.
p295_088|p295|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p295_063|p295|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p295_077|p295|He said, My own position is quite simple.
p295_117|p295|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p295_103|p295|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p295_329|p295|These findings are vitally important.
p295_315|p295|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p295_301|p295|It was not being marketed properly.
p295_300|p295|It should be a condition of employment.
p295_314|p295|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p295_328|p295|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p295_102|p295|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p295_116|p295|I have no plans to retire.
p295_076|p295|But then they scored their fourth.
p295_062|p295|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p295_089|p295|It is giving out the wrong message.
p295_274|p295|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p295_260|p295|But it was the sensible thing to do.
p295_248|p295|It became a book by itself.
p295_286|p295|I'm not sure.
p295_292|p295|Anyone can still win this tournament.
p295_245|p295|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p295_251|p295|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p295_279|p295|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p295_084|p295|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p295_090|p295|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p295_053|p295|For sure we want to win it.
p295_133|p295|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p295_127|p295|Sure, we have problems.
p295_331|p295|I certainly think it should be there.
p295_325|p295|We're very close to making it in Europe.
p295_319|p295|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p295_318|p295|It's an hour of the same response.
p295_324|p295|It will not work in our favour.
p295_330|p295|That's always the case, isn't it?
p295_126|p295|You have a very persuasive president.
p295_132|p295|I can't see myself in one of those.
p295_052|p295|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p295_046|p295|I'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295_091|p295|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p295_085|p295|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p295_278|p295|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p295_250|p295|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p295_244|p295|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p295_293|p295|My husband was angry.
p295_287|p295|But the championship is not over yet.
p295_291|p295|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p295_285|p295|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p295_252|p295|What kind of festival is proposed?
p295_246|p295|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p295_093|p295|Nothing has changed from the season before.
p295_087|p295|I don't entirely buy that.
p295_050|p295|He declined to give further details.
p295_044|p295|It is just like any other club.
p295_078|p295|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p295_124|p295|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p295_130|p295|Five years later, the deception continued.
p295_118|p295|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p295_326|p295|It was hugely popular decision.
p295_332|p295|I'm sure that they will learn.
p295_333|p295|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p295_327|p295|The decision was left entirely to him.
p295_119|p295|There were far more pressing matters to consider.
p295_131|p295|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p295_125|p295|The look on his face was something special.
p295_079|p295|It has to find out what went wrong.
p295_045|p295|Everything is possible in football.
p295_051|p295|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p295_086|p295|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p295_092|p295|As a nation, we must become more active.
p295_247|p295|Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
p295_253|p295|In my experience, he does not do that.
p295_284|p295|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
p295_290|p295|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p295_294|p295|You're going to die.
p295_280|p295|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p295_257|p295|Controllers major concern is safety.
p295_243|p295|When he came to see me on Monday.
p295_096|p295|We recognise it as a key area.
p295_082|p295|Or is it the European approach?
p295_069|p295|SO now we know the secret.
p295_055|p295|Such debate is pointless.
p295_041|p295|I'm sure he would love it.
p295_109|p295|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p295_121|p295|This is a test of our character.
p295_135|p295|He added, We have the same desire.
p295_323|p295|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p295_337|p295|We are well insured.
p295_336|p295|This time, however, may have been different.
p295_322|p295|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p295_134|p295|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p295_120|p295|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p295_108|p295|Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
p295_040|p295|Our children are the future of our society.
p295_054|p295|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p295_068|p295|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p295_083|p295|I had found my vision.
p295_097|p295|The mood was euphoric.
p295_242|p295|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p295_256|p295|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p295_281|p295|Surely it can't get any worse.
p295_295|p295|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p295_283|p295|We still have a long, long way to go.
p295_297|p295|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p295_268|p295|This latter point is hugely important.
p295_240|p295|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p295_254|p295|We're all involved in creating the work.
p295_081|p295|We're just delighted to be back on top.
p295_095|p295|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p295_042|p295|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p295_056|p295|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p295_122|p295|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p295_308|p295|This is your chance.
p295_320|p295|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p295_321|p295|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p295_335|p295|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p295_309|p295|They told him to go to drama school.
p295_123|p295|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p295_137|p295|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p295_057|p295|We recorded it at our own expense.
p295_043|p295|It's just not our biggest problem.
p295_094|p295|I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
p295_080|p295|People are already enjoying it.
p295_255|p295|When we started the album.
p295_241|p295|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p295_269|p295|The airport was even different.
p295_296|p295|We're not really commenting on that.
p295_282|p295|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p295_226|p295|It left me with a sadness.
p295_232|p295|It is a very beautiful city.
p295_030|p295|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p295_018|p295|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p295_193|p295|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p295_187|p295|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p295_150|p295|We opened up and everything was gone.
p295_144|p295|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p295_178|p295|It was far from business as usual.
p295_391|p295|Our position is not a logic of war.
p295_385|p295|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p295_352|p295|Worse still, it can be infectious.
p295_420|p295|But, of course, it isn't.
p295_346|p295|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p295_408|p295|Barry will be able to handle this.
p295_409|p295|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p295_421|p295|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p295_347|p295|Four years is a long time.
p295_353|p295|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p295_384|p295|We all started running forward.
p295_390|p295|We don't even know his name.
p295_179|p295|There's nothing new in that argument.
p295_145|p295|He's working hard on that right now.
p295_151|p295|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p295_186|p295|I'm sure it will go on.
p295_192|p295|They tried to give her advice.
p295_019|p295|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p295_031|p295|Which is where the manager comes in.
p295_025|p295|It has never been worthwhile.
p295_233|p295|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p295_227|p295|We don't have any senior players.
p295_231|p295|He has a wealth of experience.
p295_225|p295|Parole is a decision for me.
p295_219|p295|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p295_033|p295|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p295_027|p295|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p295_184|p295|No means testing will be required.
p295_190|p295|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p295_147|p295|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p295_153|p295|I try to be open to experience.
p295_386|p295|That, however, is only part of the story.
p295_392|p295|I have played really well all year.
p295_345|p295|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p295_423|p295|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p295_351|p295|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p295_379|p295|Surely the answer is yes.
p295_378|p295|General, You didn't get a modified.
p295_350|p295|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p295_344|p295|But you can go beyond that condition.
p295_422|p295|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p295_393|p295|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p295_387|p295|It worked well in Monaco.
p295_152|p295|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p295_146|p295|The jury is still out.
p295_191|p295|I need a publishing deal!
p295_185|p295|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p295_026|p295|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p295_032|p295|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p295_218|p295|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p295_224|p295|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p295_230|p295|This will help our confidence.
p295_208|p295|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p295_234|p295|His father and mother are in film production.
p295_220|p295|The joint bid is still on course.
p295_036|p295|She asked me for the appointment with me.
p295_022|p295|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p295_181|p295|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p295_195|p295|We have all been there at some point.
p295_142|p295|What did you learn in school today?
p295_156|p295|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p295_383|p295|Our proposals are fully costed.
p295_397|p295|That is European law.
p295_368|p295|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p295_340|p295|It's like a garage.
p295_354|p295|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p295_355|p295|He is very much in our thoughts.
p295_341|p295|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p295_369|p295|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p295_396|p295|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p295_382|p295|That sort of thing is long gone.
p295_157|p295|We must get the three points.
p295_143|p295|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p295_194|p295|Defeat is simply not an option.
p295_180|p295|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p295_037|p295|He must not be removed from office.
p295_221|p295|This is the best moment of my career.
p295_235|p295|It's about attitudes to change.
p295_209|p295|We need to know more about her.
p295_237|p295|We have seen the failure of politics.
p295_009|p295|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p295_021|p295|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p295_035|p295|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p295_196|p295|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p295_182|p295|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p295_169|p295|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p295_155|p295|I'm sure they will be very happy.
p295_141|p295|I got very, very tired.
p295_394|p295|It was visibly on fire.
p295_380|p295|It's part of your life.
p295_419|p295|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p295_357|p295|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p295_343|p295|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p295_342|p295|I believe in public services.
p295_424|p295|There is still the question of his health.
p295_356|p295|So what could be better than becoming captain?
p295_418|p295|We suspect he was pleased.
p295_381|p295|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p295_395|p295|It was a fiery game.
p295_140|p295|Seven people were later detained by police.
p295_154|p295|I remember it clearly.
p295_168|p295|He should emerge as the winner.
p295_183|p295|The deadline is real and absolute.
p295_197|p295|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
p295_034|p295|We thought we would never see them again.
p295_020|p295|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p295_008|p295|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p295_236|p295|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p295_222|p295|My life has been turned upside down.
p261_004|p261|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p261_010|p261|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p261_038|p261|This represents a tough game for us.
p261_170|p261|Was it the wife?
p261_164|p261|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p261_158|p261|We have to move forward.
p261_399|p261|I felt the head was very like me.
p261_372|p261|Had this been common practice?
p261_414|p261|It is good for Europe.
p261_400|p261|It was fit for royalty.
p261_366|p261|He is not very big, either.
p261_428|p261|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p261_429|p261|He was on a horse.
p261_401|p261|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p261_367|p261|Finally came the moment of truth.
p261_373|p261|What do they want us to do?
p261_415|p261|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p261_398|p261|I wanted to go out on a high.
p261_159|p261|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p261_165|p261|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p261_171|p261|Why change it?
p261_039|p261|Their campaign is in disarray.
p261_011|p261|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p261_005|p261|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p261_213|p261|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p261_207|p261|What are you not good at?
p261_211|p261|I chose to go by the rules.
p261_205|p261|Does the name matter?
p261_239|p261|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p261_013|p261|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p261_007|p261|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p261_198|p261|He should emerge as the winner.
p261_167|p261|They could not match it.
p261_173|p261|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p261_365|p261|He was then replaced by Ross.
p261_403|p261|How do you take them away?
p261_417|p261|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p261_371|p261|He did a good job.
p261_359|p261|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p261_358|p261|There was some merit in that.
p261_416|p261|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p261_370|p261|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p261_364|p261|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p261_402|p261|We operate as a Scottish company.
p261_172|p261|What do we want to do that for?
p261_166|p261|The region is open for business.
p261_199|p261|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p261_006|p261|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p261_012|p261|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p261_238|p261|They tried to give her advice.
p261_204|p261|It was his own decision.
p261_210|p261|A deadline is still essential.
p261_228|p261|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p261_214|p261|They are looking at a flotation.
p261_200|p261|I made a terrible start.
p261_016|p261|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p261_002|p261|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p261_189|p261|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p261_162|p261|I would probably have to agree with him.
p261_176|p261|It is a body blow.
p261_348|p261|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p261_406|p261|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p261_360|p261|It's too horrible to think.
p261_374|p261|Is it worth it?
p261_412|p261|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p261_375|p261|Does it matter?
p261_413|p261|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p261_407|p261|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p261_361|p261|They are now out in the cold.
p261_349|p261|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p261_177|p261|The jury is still out.
p261_163|p261|You had to go and see him.
p261_188|p261|That is a waste of energy.
p261_003|p261|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p261_017|p261|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p261_201|p261|It was a moment of madness.
p261_215|p261|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p261_229|p261|Life is too short to be bitter.
p261_203|p261|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p261_217|p261|It was far from business as usual.
p261_029|p261|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p261_001|p261|Please call Stella.  
p261_015|p261|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p261_149|p261|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p261_175|p261|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p261_161|p261|The pension levels will remain the same.
p261_388|p261|He must have seen the movie.
p261_439|p261|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p261_411|p261|I had a fortunate war.
p261_377|p261|I am a lucky man.
p261_363|p261|My view has now completely changed.
p261_405|p261|After the match, do you?
p261_362|p261|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p261_404|p261|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p261_410|p261|Motion described it as a unique event.
p261_376|p261|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p261_438|p261|The trial will open today.
p261_389|p261|We must put a marker down.
p261_160|p261|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p261_174|p261|I always felt they played for me.
p261_148|p261|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p261_014|p261|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p261_028|p261|Life was like a timetable.
p261_216|p261|We have an election in eight days.
p261_202|p261|We believe a third party was involved.
p261_265|p261|This idea has been around for four years.
p261_271|p261|Do I think about them often?
p261_259|p261|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p261_098|p261|I had a ball today.
p261_067|p261|That's not the intention at all.
p261_073|p261|The price cuts are really exciting.
p261_113|p261|He thought she was amazing.
p261_107|p261|So, did she meet him?
p261_311|p261|He will address the nation this evening.
p261_305|p261|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p261_463|p261|Let that be their memorial.
p261_339|p261|What form did that take?
p261_338|p261|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p261_304|p261|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p261_462|p261|They were totally behind it.
p261_310|p261|Size is not the issue.
p261_106|p261|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p261_112|p261|It became a national network.
p261_072|p261|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p261_066|p261|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p261_099|p261|No, the equipment is extra.
p261_258|p261|We will listen to any suggestion.
p261_270|p261|What was the matter for concern?
p261_264|p261|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p261_299|p261|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p261_272|p261|Is it in the right place?
p261_266|p261|The concerns are the same.
p261_070|p261|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p261_064|p261|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p261_058|p261|How are you, sir?
p261_104|p261|It was a funny game.
p261_110|p261|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p261_138|p261|Check that he is dead.
p261_460|p261|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p261_306|p261|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p261_312|p261|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p261_474|p261|My place is in the kitchen.
p261_448|p261|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p261_449|p261|He deserves a second chance.
p261_313|p261|Tony Blair said as little.
p261_461|p261|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
p261_307|p261|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p261_139|p261|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
p261_111|p261|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p261_105|p261|Why do it otherwise?
p261_059|p261|So is that it, then?
p261_065|p261|It's not covered by the insurance.
p261_071|p261|Then followed a bout of flu.
p261_267|p261|I can't get a job.
p261_273|p261|Did he trip?
p261_298|p261|A senior party insider said.
p261_288|p261|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
p261_277|p261|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p261_263|p261|It seems a shame to leave it.
p261_049|p261|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p261_075|p261|These people are not big names.
p261_061|p261|What do we do?
p261_129|p261|You are a gambling man.
p261_101|p261|Before the game we went for a pint.
p261_115|p261|It isn't a happy memory.
p261_459|p261|It all began as an accident.
p261_303|p261|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p261_465|p261|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p261_471|p261|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
p261_317|p261|Holland won by five wickets.
p261_470|p261|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p261_316|p261|That is the general feeling.
p261_302|p261|The two companies were not for sale.
p261_464|p261|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p261_458|p261|Our legal advice is clear.
p261_114|p261|Maybe this battle has been.
p261_100|p261|It is a good lifestyle.
p261_128|p261|I have accepted the challenge.
p261_060|p261|Do I have a favourite?
p261_074|p261|He is now resident in England.
p261_048|p261|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p261_262|p261|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p261_276|p261|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p261_289|p261|He has not created a Festival resource.
p261_248|p261|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p261_260|p261|I should think so, too.
p261_274|p261|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p261_089|p261|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p261_062|p261|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p261_076|p261|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p261_116|p261|Actors like to be in the centre.
p261_102|p261|We are also looking for new licences.
p261_328|p261|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p261_314|p261|His was a huge success story.
p261_472|p261|It's been a long, long journey.
p261_466|p261|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p261_300|p261|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p261_467|p261|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p261_301|p261|This will help our confidence.
p261_315|p261|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p261_473|p261|War is not the action.
p261_329|p261|The City welcomed the numbers.
p261_103|p261|Our house was very small.
p261_117|p261|It's not a quick fix.
p261_077|p261|He is in the queue.
p261_063|p261|Only water is currently allowed.
p261_088|p261|It is high time to act.
p261_275|p261|I was ready for this.
p261_261|p261|No production contract is yet in sight.
p261_249|p261|I was just a kid.
p261_287|p261|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p261_293|p261|He was also married with two children.
p261_244|p261|I haven't made the donation yet.
p261_250|p261|It is now the big brother.
p261_278|p261|They are interior designers and architects.
p261_085|p261|They deserve a lot of credit.
p261_091|p261|We could not get any possession.
p261_046|p261|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p261_052|p261|It is on the news.
p261_132|p261|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p261_126|p261|That would open the gates of hell.
p261_456|p261|Paris is not only young.
p261_330|p261|You will never get a conviction.
p261_324|p261|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p261_442|p261|Everything in golf is a balance.
p261_318|p261|He was obviously very genuine.
p261_319|p261|The casting is as perfect.
p261_325|p261|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p261_443|p261|It is a case of pity for us.
p261_457|p261|No one wants to go through these things.
p261_331|p261|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p261_127|p261|He can perform well under pressure.
p261_133|p261|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p261_053|p261|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p261_047|p261|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p261_090|p261|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
p261_084|p261|Potions said he would drive.
p261_279|p261|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p261_251|p261|They showed a lot of heart.
p261_245|p261|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p261_292|p261|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p261_286|p261|They can leave at any time.
p261_290|p261|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p261_284|p261|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p261_253|p261|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p261_247|p261|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p261_092|p261|It was clear on Thursday.
p261_086|p261|However, it did not end that way.
p261_051|p261|I must take a seat.
p261_045|p261|He will need that machine.
p261_079|p261|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p261_125|p261|If not, a deal could take many months.
p261_131|p261|This is a successful outcome.
p261_119|p261|Structural changes were also required.
p261_441|p261|It is an absolute nonsense.
p261_327|p261|Cast Away now on general release.
p261_333|p261|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p261_455|p261|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p261_469|p261|They are defined by law.
p261_468|p261|No options are excluded at all.
p261_332|p261|That meant the search was unlawful.
p261_454|p261|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p261_440|p261|It will make a huge difference.
p261_326|p261|It is a potential danger.
p261_118|p261|But it took a lot of bottle.
p261_130|p261|He is a great addition to our team.
p261_124|p261|My life has changed a lot.
p261_078|p261|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p261_044|p261|I would love to have him home.
p261_050|p261|There was no safety net.
p261_087|p261|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p261_093|p261|But it is up again.
p261_246|p261|The irony was not lost.
p261_252|p261|Nato was not a love affair.
p261_285|p261|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p261_291|p261|He has run a hell of a race.
p261_295|p261|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p261_281|p261|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
p261_256|p261|We want to play at the worlds.
p261_242|p261|This is a family club.
p261_097|p261|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p261_083|p261|They lived for their children.
p261_068|p261|It starts with the script.
p261_054|p261|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p261_040|p261|Among them are many criminals.
p261_108|p261|So what is the campaign about?
p261_120|p261|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p261_134|p261|We will try to find someone.
p261_322|p261|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p261_444|p261|Gordon is also highly rated.
p261_450|p261|You have to see the work.
p261_336|p261|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p261_451|p261|The funding is now there.
p261_337|p261|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p261_323|p261|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p261_445|p261|The first game is so important.
p261_135|p261|The others have all been in storage for some time.
p261_121|p261|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p261_109|p261|And does it?
p261_041|p261|I was released after six days.
p261_055|p261|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p261_069|p261|There could be a way back.
p261_082|p261|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p261_096|p261|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p261_243|p261|It is the loss of my name.
p261_257|p261|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p261_280|p261|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
p261_294|p261|It was an easy decision to come here.
p261_282|p261|At first I thought I was gone.
p261_296|p261|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p261_269|p261|was everything done to save people?
p261_241|p261|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p261_255|p261|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p261_080|p261|We have to offer value for money.
p261_094|p261|All the pressure will be on him.
p261_043|p261|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p261_057|p261|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p261_137|p261|We could easily have lost that game.
p261_123|p261|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p261_309|p261|We will deliver at director level.
p261_335|p261|I would do away with the dress code.
p261_453|p261|I was embarrassed by it.
p261_447|p261|And we might go back.
p261_321|p261|A Home Office spokesman said.
p261_446|p261|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p261_320|p261|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p261_334|p261|There will be good prospects ahead.
p261_452|p261|But we have built a platform for next season.
p261_308|p261|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p261_122|p261|I was on a roll.
p261_136|p261|She died at her home.
p261_056|p261|We will pay their bills.
p261_042|p261|That's been the difference between the sides.
p261_095|p261|You are like an animal.
p261_081|p261|Our mother is very worried.
p261_254|p261|It was a poor performance.
p261_240|p261|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p261_268|p261|And they were being paid?
p261_297|p261|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p261_283|p261|I am just trying to do my job.
p261_227|p261|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p261_233|p261|The statement contained no surprises.
p261_025|p261|They are very clever in their use of words.
p261_031|p261|I have never been a member of the council.
p261_019|p261|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p261_192|p261|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p261_186|p261|They need to look after themselves.
p261_151|p261|But I am still awaiting an answer.
p261_145|p261|It has become a way of life.
p261_179|p261|City sentiment is in his favour.
p261_390|p261|The result is called a patent.
p261_384|p261|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
p261_353|p261|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p261_435|p261|He is on the wrong side.
p261_421|p261|The second goal was superb.
p261_347|p261|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p261_409|p261|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p261_408|p261|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p261_420|p261|Smoking is also very important.
p261_346|p261|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p261_352|p261|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p261_434|p261|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p261_385|p261|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p261_391|p261|It's as wide as a church in here.
p261_178|p261|It is not either national standards or local control.
p261_144|p261|I would relish the prospect.
p261_150|p261|It was by the numbers.
p261_187|p261|He prefers to play for them.
p261_193|p261|It had been in place since last July.
p261_018|p261|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p261_030|p261|We will look into it.
p261_024|p261|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p261_232|p261|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p261_226|p261|It was a day for records.
p261_230|p261|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p261_224|p261|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p261_218|p261|All will be revealed in due course.
p261_032|p261|It was a close call.
p261_026|p261|Meetings will also remain private.
p261_185|p261|I had too much to drink.
p261_191|p261|That was the theory, anyway.
p261_146|p261|Like the others, he was arrested.
p261_152|p261|We will turn the corner.
p261_387|p261|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p261_393|p261|The pair are very much in love.
p261_344|p261|So what happens next?
p261_422|p261|We're delighted about the vote.
p261_436|p261|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p261_350|p261|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
p261_378|p261|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p261_379|p261|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p261_437|p261|It was the climax of the thing.
p261_351|p261|The whole family was in shock.
p261_345|p261|This ruling is a farce.
p261_423|p261|The case will now go to appeal.
p261_392|p261|This remains the party's policy.
p261_386|p261|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p261_153|p261|He was asked to quit.
p261_147|p261|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p261_190|p261|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p261_184|p261|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p261_027|p261|Because we do not need it.
p261_033|p261|That means an extra two years.
p261_219|p261|They have known the hard times.
p261_225|p261|He must get to know himself.
p261_231|p261|It could be to do with the location.
p261_209|p261|Who was she?
p261_235|p261|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p261_221|p261|Construction is due to begin in February.
p261_037|p261|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p261_023|p261|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p261_180|p261|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p261_194|p261|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p261_143|p261|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p261_157|p261|The bank was now involved.
p261_382|p261|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p261_396|p261|However, it was well worth the wait.
p261_369|p261|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p261_427|p261|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p261_341|p261|What are they for?
p261_355|p261|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p261_433|p261|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p261_354|p261|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p261_432|p261|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p261_426|p261|It was important to win the singles.
p261_340|p261|Are they free?
p261_368|p261|Neither man has been charged.
p261_397|p261|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p261_383|p261|They should take their mobile phones.
p261_156|p261|These days are long gone.
p261_142|p261|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p261_195|p261|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p261_181|p261|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p261_022|p261|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p261_036|p261|He is believed to live in Britain.
p261_220|p261|It has been like that all year for me.
p261_234|p261|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p261_208|p261|I think, therefore I am?
p261_222|p261|Seven people were critically injured.
p261_236|p261|They have not been in touch with the club.
p261_008|p261|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p261_020|p261|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p261_034|p261|This film will be totally awesome.
p261_197|p261|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p261_183|p261|Says the Duke of York.
p261_168|p261|What happened in that game?
p261_154|p261|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p261_140|p261|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p261_395|p261|You have to rely on each other.
p261_381|p261|You did not see it.
p261_418|p261|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p261_430|p261|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p261_356|p261|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p261_342|p261|Is there a waiting list?
p261_424|p261|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p261_343|p261|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p261_425|p261|Yet the data is compelling.
p261_431|p261|That's the way it works.
p261_357|p261|Her life is now back on track.
p261_419|p261|But a surprise is in store.
p261_380|p261|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p261_394|p261|I am a good player.
p261_141|p261|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p261_155|p261|The strong pound also took its toll.
p261_169|p261|Are you going to win?
p261_182|p261|I will be in Scotland.
p261_196|p261|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p261_035|p261|That was the case with David.
p261_021|p261|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p261_009|p261|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p261_237|p261|I need a publishing deal!
p261_223|p261|My daughter is an adult.
p259_327|p259|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p259_333|p259|Is there a waiting list?
p259_455|p259|Nobody has told the story.
p259_119|p259|We have the mental strength.
p259_125|p259|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p259_131|p259|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p259_079|p259|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p259_051|p259|I had trouble with the producers.
p259_045|p259|Among them are many criminals.
p259_092|p259|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p259_086|p259|How are you, sir?
p259_253|p259|You are like an animal.
p259_247|p259|We will reform the welfare state.
p259_290|p259|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p259_284|p259|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p259_285|p259|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p259_291|p259|He took over our lives.
p259_246|p259|Things were so intense in the studio.
p259_252|p259|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p259_087|p259|So is that it, then?
p259_093|p259|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p259_044|p259|The boy is no longer with us.
p259_050|p259|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p259_078|p259|It gave no further details.
p259_130|p259|It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.
p259_124|p259|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p259_118|p259|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p259_332|p259|What are they for?
p259_454|p259|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p259_440|p259|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p259_326|p259|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p259_468|p259|She came to the Highland Show.
p259_318|p259|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p259_456|p259|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p259_330|p259|No Briton has ever won.
p259_324|p259|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p259_442|p259|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p259_481|p259|The chief constable has retired.
p259_132|p259|I am totally devoted to this job.
p259_126|p259|We did what we had to do.
p259_046|p259|Merger would be entirely logical.
p259_052|p259|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p259_085|p259|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p259_091|p259|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p259_278|p259|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p259_244|p259|People should make their own decisions.
p259_250|p259|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p259_287|p259|We accept the new rules.
p259_293|p259|I'd never run for them.
p259_292|p259|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p259_286|p259|You have got the evidence.
p259_251|p259|The scientific debate is dead.
p259_245|p259|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p259_279|p259|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p259_090|p259|Why do it otherwise?
p259_084|p259|It is normal for me.
p259_053|p259|We have not given up hope.
p259_047|p259|He looks like an Afghan.
p259_127|p259|But it is different in different regions.
p259_133|p259|Before it was an ordeal.
p259_480|p259|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p259_325|p259|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p259_443|p259|My aim is a top six finish.
p259_457|p259|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p259_331|p259|Are they free?
p259_319|p259|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p259_335|p259|So what happens next?
p259_453|p259|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p259_447|p259|I never had a childhood.
p259_321|p259|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p259_309|p259|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p259_137|p259|It was started almost by accident.
p259_123|p259|We had another last Tuesday.
p259_043|p259|Several investments have already been made.
p259_057|p259|Let's hope that it does.
p259_080|p259|Our mother is very worried.
p259_094|p259|Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.
p259_241|p259|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p259_255|p259|We will try to find someone.
p259_269|p259|What form did that take?
p259_282|p259|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p259_296|p259|These figures are truly terrible.
p259_297|p259|I felt about this big.
p259_283|p259|I should think so, too.
p259_268|p259|How independent is that?
p259_254|p259|The body follows the mind.
p259_240|p259|I am considered a teenager.
p259_095|p259|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p259_081|p259|Potions said he would drive.
p259_056|p259|They had been in Scotland on exercise.
p259_042|p259|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p259_122|p259|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p259_136|p259|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p259_308|p259|Blair also had a penalty.
p259_446|p259|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p259_320|p259|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p259_334|p259|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p259_452|p259|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p259_322|p259|We will deliver at director level.
p259_444|p259|It means an enormous amount.
p259_450|p259|There is another important factor.
p259_336|p259|Had this been common practice?
p259_478|p259|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p259_120|p259|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p259_134|p259|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p259_108|p259|It is a good lifestyle.
p259_054|p259|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p259_040|p259|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p259_068|p259|It is a job creation scheme.
p259_097|p259|Ferguson must take the blame.
p259_083|p259|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
p259_256|p259|It had so much to do with output.
p259_242|p259|He must get to know himself.
p259_295|p259|They must play for each other.
p259_281|p259|We will listen to any suggestion.
p259_280|p259|No date has been fixed for his return.
p259_294|p259|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p259_243|p259|The transaction is not feasible.
p259_257|p259|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p259_082|p259|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p259_096|p259|We would have concerns about that.
p259_069|p259|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p259_041|p259|It carried a double message.
p259_055|p259|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p259_109|p259|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p259_135|p259|Reaction to the device was mixed.
p259_121|p259|That admission is not surprising.
p259_479|p259|Some problems were too complex.
p259_451|p259|I never found my rhythm.
p259_337|p259|What do they want us to do?
p259_323|p259|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p259_445|p259|Such an attack is bizarre.
p259_378|p259|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p259_344|p259|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p259_422|p259|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p259_436|p259|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p259_350|p259|The pound has also suffered.
p259_387|p259|He had no previous convictions.
p259_393|p259|How do you take them away?
p259_146|p259|What do we want to do that for?
p259_152|p259|He was seen as the enemy.
p259_185|p259|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p259_191|p259|We've just had it confirmed.
p259_032|p259|The function of the clerk is to provide advice.
p259_026|p259|Smoking is also very important.
p259_218|p259|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p259_230|p259|January is a bad time of year.
p259_224|p259|Little is known about them.
p259_225|p259|I won't make an official complaint.
p259_231|p259|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p259_219|p259|The early physical reports were clear.
p259_027|p259|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p259_033|p259|We speak about the performance.
p259_190|p259|That's not fair to the supporters.
p259_184|p259|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p259_153|p259|That group reported just before Christmas.
p259_147|p259|Does the name matter?
p259_392|p259|Does it matter?
p259_386|p259|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p259_437|p259|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p259_351|p259|Scotland has shown the way.
p259_345|p259|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p259_423|p259|I've had a wonderful career.
p259_379|p259|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p259_409|p259|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p259_353|p259|We think the timing is good.
p259_435|p259|I watch the other visitors.
p259_421|p259|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p259_347|p259|Job losses were also announced.
p259_390|p259|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p259_384|p259|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p259_179|p259|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p259_151|p259|His second goal was equally impressive.
p259_145|p259|Why change it?
p259_192|p259|I will have to order its destruction.
p259_186|p259|Each case is treated on merit.
p259_019|p259|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p259_025|p259|But it could prove disastrous.
p259_031|p259|Everyone can have their opinion.
p259_227|p259|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p259_233|p259|From there, they can go anywhere.
p259_232|p259|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p259_226|p259|It was worth a photograph.
p259_030|p259|I could not do it.
p259_024|p259|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p259_018|p259|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p259_187|p259|It is only the beginning.
p259_193|p259|You know the sort of thing.
p259_144|p259|Was it the wife?
p259_150|p259|The referee faces a massive job.
p259_178|p259|I always felt they played for me.
p259_385|p259|I've always been a sensitive.
p259_391|p259|They have broken that promise.
p259_420|p259|It's too close to call.
p259_346|p259|McNaughton was not so sure.
p259_352|p259|There will be good prospects ahead.
p259_434|p259|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p259_408|p259|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p259_430|p259|The next few months will tell.
p259_356|p259|Other people had looked at it.
p259_342|p259|This will save interest charges.
p259_424|p259|The BBC was a disgrace.
p259_418|p259|My view has now completely changed.
p259_395|p259|After the match, do you?
p259_381|p259|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p259_154|p259|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p259_140|p259|I'm so grateful for that.
p259_168|p259|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p259_197|p259|I'm interested in interesting work.
p259_183|p259|It is vital to clarify their role.
p259_020|p259|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p259_034|p259|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p259_008|p259|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p259_222|p259|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
p259_236|p259|My daughter is an adult.
p259_237|p259|His third goal was superb.
p259_223|p259|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p259_009|p259|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p259_035|p259|Because he was born in England.
p259_021|p259|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p259_182|p259|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p259_196|p259|It shows the strength of the roots.
p259_169|p259|He was right into football from an early age.
p259_141|p259|But she was very human.
p259_155|p259|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p259_380|p259|He can handle it without any problem.
p259_394|p259|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p259_419|p259|I had a fortunate war.
p259_343|p259|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p259_425|p259|It is hard to understand.
p259_431|p259|It is not over by any means.
p259_357|p259|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p259_427|p259|There was an element of frustration.
p259_341|p259|The songs are just so good.
p259_355|p259|We want to play at the worlds.
p259_433|p259|Three years ago he would have been.
p259_369|p259|They promised to fight the plans.
p259_382|p259|He is an excellent manager.
p259_396|p259|That is a crazy situation.
p259_143|p259|Are you going to win?
p259_157|p259|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p259_180|p259|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p259_194|p259|I cannot say too much about them.
p259_037|p259|Child benefit will not be affected.
p259_023|p259|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p259_235|p259|It had all been arranged.
p259_221|p259|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p259_209|p259|And they were being paid?
p259_208|p259|He was then replaced by Ross.
p259_220|p259|The result is utterly compelling.
p259_234|p259|I am delighted for Simon.
p259_022|p259|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p259_036|p259|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p259_195|p259|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p259_181|p259|Phase one was a shambles.
p259_156|p259|So I got a blood test.
p259_142|p259|What happened in that game?
p259_397|p259|We are really good friends.
p259_383|p259|I think we'll just keep it.
p259_368|p259|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p259_354|p259|He will go a long way.
p259_432|p259|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p259_426|p259|But the foundations have been laid.
p259_340|p259|The results are sometimes contentious.
p259_359|p259|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p259_365|p259|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p259_403|p259|It would be quite nice.
p259_417|p259|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p259_371|p259|He was unable to come.
p259_167|p259|The woman was his wife.
p259_173|p259|We have a budget in March.
p259_198|p259|Shelter also supports the reform.
p259_013|p259|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p259_007|p259|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p259_239|p259|They are difficult awards to decide.
p259_211|p259|What was the matter for concern?
p259_205|p259|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p259_204|p259|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p259_210|p259|was everything done to save people?
p259_238|p259|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p259_006|p259|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p259_012|p259|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p259_199|p259|We represent a wide range of society.
p259_172|p259|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p259_166|p259|It was by the numbers.
p259_416|p259|We have very limited capacity.
p259_370|p259|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p259_364|p259|It's too horrible to think.
p259_402|p259|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p259_358|p259|I didn't have the reply.
p259_428|p259|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p259_372|p259|He was at school in Devon.
p259_414|p259|It is the nature of his party.
p259_400|p259|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
p259_366|p259|Industrial action has to hurt.
p259_399|p259|The salary changes are long overdue.
p259_158|p259|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p259_170|p259|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p259_164|p259|Nothing was meant by it.
p259_038|p259|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p259_004|p259|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p259_010|p259|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p259_206|p259|In due course we will make an announcement.
p259_212|p259|Do I think about them often?
p259_213|p259|Is it in the right place?
p259_207|p259|He should emerge as the winner.
p259_011|p259|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p259_005|p259|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p259_039|p259|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p259_165|p259|Behind him was his brother.
p259_171|p259|It's never great to finish second.
p259_159|p259|The two companies were not for sale.
p259_398|p259|The principle is quite clear.
p259_401|p259|She said they would appeal.
p259_367|p259|Nobody said it was required.
p259_373|p259|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p259_415|p259|Theatre is not a museum.
p259_429|p259|The casualties were not named.
p259_411|p259|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
p259_377|p259|An alternative must be offered.
p259_363|p259|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p259_405|p259|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p259_439|p259|There is a solution, she believes.
p259_388|p259|It was a massive error of judgment.
p259_175|p259|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
p259_161|p259|We have to speed up the process.
p259_149|p259|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p259_001|p259|Please call Stella.  
p259_015|p259|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p259_029|p259|He has the courage of the unaware.
p259_203|p259|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p259_217|p259|This will be our new beginning.
p259_216|p259|Here the picture is broadly stable.
p259_202|p259|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p259_028|p259|I am pretty careful with money.
p259_014|p259|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p259_148|p259|how do you get it back?
p259_160|p259|People were actually not on his side.
p259_174|p259|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p259_389|p259|They should take their mobile phones.
p259_438|p259|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p259_362|p259|A Home Office spokesman said.
p259_404|p259|This remains the party's policy.
p259_410|p259|The team hadn't been picked.
p259_376|p259|Neither man has been charged.
p259_406|p259|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p259_360|p259|You may have a short memory.
p259_374|p259|Finally came the moment of truth.
p259_412|p259|It sounds like a wish list.
p259_348|p259|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p259_162|p259|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p259_176|p259|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p259_189|p259|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p259_016|p259|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p259_002|p259|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p259_214|p259|Did he trip?
p259_200|p259|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p259_228|p259|We have an election in eight days.
p259_229|p259|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p259_201|p259|It caused a lot of upset.
p259_215|p259|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p259_003|p259|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p259_017|p259|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p259_188|p259|He played it like a veteran.
p259_177|p259|The people are the hero.
p259_163|p259|The weather forecast isn't good.
p259_349|p259|The party lasted all night.
p259_375|p259|Whether this return was too soon.
p259_413|p259|The director will be present.
p259_407|p259|We will win the argument.
p259_361|p259|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p259_448|p259|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p259_460|p259|It is pretty bad news.
p259_306|p259|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p259_312|p259|It seemed a logical expansion.
p259_474|p259|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p259_138|p259|Scotland will finish the group in second place.
p259_104|p259|They will remember this victory for a while.
p259_110|p259|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p259_058|p259|We have to keep our clients.
p259_070|p259|Even the one she loved.
p259_064|p259|It wasn't possible to relax.
p259_272|p259|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p259_266|p259|Do you think we are a top nation?
p259_299|p259|There's not much money in cycling.
p259_298|p259|It is also very valuable.
p259_267|p259|Is our children learning?
p259_273|p259|I have received no explanation.
p259_065|p259|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p259_071|p259|Today it was really enjoyable.
p259_059|p259|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p259_111|p259|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p259_105|p259|But they must believe in themselves.
p259_139|p259|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p259_313|p259|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p259_475|p259|There was no trouble at all.
p259_461|p259|It certainly appeared that way.
p259_307|p259|We have a high quality product.
p259_449|p259|None of the pieces was commissioned.
p259_339|p259|His appeal is instantly understood.
p259_477|p259|The price paid for it was not disclosed.
p259_311|p259|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p259_305|p259|We shall rely on human beings.
p259_463|p259|Quality was high in all sections.
p259_113|p259|He was jailed for a year.
p259_107|p259|The following are the principal provisions.
p259_067|p259|She died in hospital two hours later.
p259_073|p259|It was a unanimous decision.
p259_098|p259|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p259_259|p259|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p259_265|p259|Did it work?
p259_271|p259|He said the right things.
p259_270|p259|He was good, but not that good.
p259_264|p259|Does that put pressure on us?
p259_258|p259|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p259_099|p259|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p259_072|p259|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p259_066|p259|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p259_106|p259|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p259_112|p259|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p259_304|p259|They can leave at any time.
p259_462|p259|We put our bid in last night.
p259_476|p259|He deserved a red card.
p259_310|p259|I understand the security issue.
p259_338|p259|Is it worth it?
p259_314|p259|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
p259_472|p259|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p259_466|p259|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p259_300|p259|The stage was set for a showdown.
p259_328|p259|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p259_116|p259|The result is a vacuum.
p259_102|p259|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p259_062|p259|He hadn't had them for a long time.
p259_076|p259|I first met him last summer.
p259_089|p259|What do we do?
p259_260|p259|It will now be revived.
p259_274|p259|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p259_248|p259|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p259_249|p259|It's easy to be negative about these things.
p259_275|p259|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p259_261|p259|Italy is a beautiful place.
p259_088|p259|Do I have a favourite?
p259_077|p259|I wanted to change the formula.
p259_063|p259|Only water is currently allowed.
p259_103|p259|It's good to have a voice.
p259_117|p259|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p259_329|p259|I was just so determined.
p259_467|p259|They offer a kind of narrative.
p259_301|p259|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p259_315|p259|It's hard to see it.
p259_473|p259|I'm very passionate about my country.
p259_303|p259|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p259_465|p259|But we have built a platform for next season.
p259_471|p259|Let that be their memorial.
p259_317|p259|This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.
p259_459|p259|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p259_101|p259|I did not have a bet on myself.
p259_115|p259|New Year will be very busy.
p259_129|p259|Tiger is not the norm.
p259_075|p259|I've had it for the exams.
p259_061|p259|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p259_049|p259|I had come back from London.
p259_277|p259|You can feel at home in China.
p259_263|p259|I was just a kid.
p259_288|p259|It is probably in the culture.
p259_289|p259|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p259_262|p259|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.
p259_276|p259|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p259_048|p259|They had to explain it.
p259_060|p259|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p259_074|p259|It makes for an interesting conference.
p259_128|p259|They made such decisions in London.
p259_114|p259|The whole thing is the music.
p259_100|p259|It was clear on Thursday.
p259_458|p259|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p259_470|p259|They were good years for him.
p259_316|p259|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p259_302|p259|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p259_464|p259|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
p266_078|p266|I will miss him.
p266_087|p266|They lived for their children.
p266_093|p266|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p266_246|p266|It was a hit.
p266_252|p266|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p266_285|p266|Dialogue is the key.
p266_291|p266|Bombing slaughter rejected
p266_332|p266|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p266_326|p266|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p266_130|p266|We work well together.
p266_124|p266|There were no grounds for his action.
p266_118|p266|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p266_119|p266|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p266_125|p266|I'm so angry.
p266_131|p266|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p266_327|p266|There was no time scale.
p266_333|p266|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p266_290|p266|Who did the recruiting?
p266_284|p266|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p266_253|p266|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p266_247|p266|There's the mix.
p266_092|p266|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p266_086|p266|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p266_079|p266|He is in the queue.
p266_051|p266|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p266_045|p266|Among them are many criminals.
p266_053|p266|I expect a rapid response.
p266_047|p266|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p266_090|p266|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p266_084|p266|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p266_251|p266|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p266_245|p266|I should think so, too.
p266_279|p266|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p266_292|p266|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p266_286|p266|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p266_325|p266|The airport was even different.
p266_331|p266|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p266_319|p266|The problems began a long time ago.
p266_127|p266|I was on a roll.
p266_133|p266|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p266_132|p266|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p266_126|p266|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p266_318|p266|You may have a short memory.
p266_330|p266|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p266_324|p266|It's too horrible to think.
p266_287|p266|Tony Blair said as little.
p266_293|p266|It could well be military.
p266_278|p266|They seem to get away with it.
p266_244|p266|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p266_250|p266|We are in a war.
p266_085|p266|Someone who cares
p266_091|p266|It's good news.
p266_046|p266|Is a drug dealer?
p266_052|p266|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p266_056|p266|They're appalled by that.
p266_042|p266|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p266_095|p266|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p266_081|p266|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p266_268|p266|The system can work.
p266_254|p266|It was like the old days.
p266_240|p266|The scene is about this?
p266_297|p266|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p266_283|p266|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p266_308|p266|This is a war over our home.
p266_320|p266|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p266_334|p266|Who will do it?
p266_122|p266|Who would have?
p266_136|p266|Is that it?
p266_137|p266|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p266_123|p266|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p266_335|p266|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p266_321|p266|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p266_309|p266|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p266_282|p266|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p266_296|p266|Spent three months alone at sea.
p266_241|p266|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p266_255|p266|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p266_269|p266|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p266_080|p266|I first met him last summer.
p266_094|p266|I love the Dome.
p266_043|p266|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p266_057|p266|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p266_069|p266|Then followed a bout of flu.
p266_041|p266|It's the only thing.
p266_055|p266|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p266_082|p266|He is driven.
p266_096|p266|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p266_243|p266|My son was too young to die.
p266_257|p266|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p266_280|p266|It's so awful.
p266_294|p266|No Briton has ever won.
p266_337|p266|Two people were interviewed.
p266_323|p266|We are in the end game.
p266_109|p266|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p266_135|p266|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p266_121|p266|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p266_120|p266|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p266_134|p266|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p266_108|p266|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p266_322|p266|A review is under way.
p266_336|p266|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p266_295|p266|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p266_281|p266|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p266_256|p266|Chelsea was a great club.
p266_242|p266|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p266_097|p266|I saw the whole thing.
p266_083|p266|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p266_054|p266|What was the main difference?
p266_040|p266|Dancing was her life.
p266_068|p266|I was as strong as a horse.
p266_027|p266|Is this accurate?
p266_033|p266|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p266_225|p266|We were awful.
p266_231|p266|It's quite nice.
p266_219|p266|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p266_351|p266|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p266_345|p266|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p266_423|p266|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p266_379|p266|I am a wealthy person.
p266_392|p266|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p266_386|p266|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p266_153|p266|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p266_147|p266|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p266_190|p266|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p266_184|p266|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p266_191|p266|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p266_146|p266|That group reported just before Christmas.
p266_152|p266|The weather forecast isn't good.
p266_387|p266|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p266_393|p266|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p266_378|p266|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266_344|p266|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p266_422|p266|It looked like a war zone.
p266_350|p266|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p266_218|p266|Because they didn't want to know.
p266_230|p266|There is no excuse.
p266_224|p266|The report is due out next month.
p266_032|p266|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p266_026|p266|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p266_030|p266|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p266_024|p266|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p266_018|p266|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p266_232|p266|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p266_226|p266|They tried to give her advice.
p266_420|p266|Paris is not only young.
p266_346|p266|It is long gone.
p266_352|p266|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p266_408|p266|Relief was beyond belief.
p266_385|p266|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p266_391|p266|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p266_144|p266|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p266_150|p266|So I got a blood test.
p266_178|p266|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p266_187|p266|Our team is just so young.
p266_193|p266|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p266_192|p266|I came home by ambulance.
p266_186|p266|What has caused the demise of singing?
p266_179|p266|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p266_151|p266|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p266_145|p266|I was awful.
p266_390|p266|It is unusual.
p266_384|p266|It's like a car crash.
p266_409|p266|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p266_353|p266|She is free.
p266_421|p266|Such as it is.
p266_347|p266|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p266_227|p266|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
p266_233|p266|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p266_019|p266|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p266_025|p266|She looked so young.
p266_031|p266|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p266_009|p266|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p266_035|p266|It was clear.
p266_021|p266|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p266_237|p266|It is hard won.
p266_223|p266|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p266_419|p266|It is legally binding.
p266_343|p266|I'm very lucky.
p266_357|p266|You have to rely on each other.
p266_380|p266|Colour was at the core of his life.
p266_394|p266|They are good.
p266_169|p266|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p266_141|p266|Who would be right?
p266_155|p266|I might come back.
p266_182|p266|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p266_196|p266|Tommy is not a problem.
p266_197|p266|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p266_183|p266|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p266_154|p266|They have not been named.
p266_140|p266|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p266_168|p266|Seven people were later detained by police.
p266_395|p266|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p266_381|p266|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p266_356|p266|Yet he left a few days later.
p266_342|p266|went on sale.
p266_424|p266|I chose to make a film.
p266_418|p266|That may be.
p266_222|p266|I will win.
p266_236|p266|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p266_020|p266|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p266_034|p266|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p266_008|p266|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p266_022|p266|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p266_036|p266|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p266_208|p266|We want to keep the pound.
p266_220|p266|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p266_234|p266|It's a killer piece.
p266_368|p266|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p266_354|p266|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p266_340|p266|Maloney was asked.
p266_397|p266|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p266_156|p266|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p266_142|p266|She died at her home.
p266_195|p266|The service from the other players was super.
p266_181|p266|I've been there.
p266_180|p266|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p266_194|p266|Is that success?
p266_143|p266|He realises his mistake.
p266_157|p266|My Dad is a hero.
p266_382|p266|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p266_396|p266|It was a breathtaking moment.
p266_341|p266|But I was knocked out by the city.
p266_355|p266|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p266_369|p266|It's now down in black and white.
p266_235|p266|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p266_221|p266|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p266_209|p266|I was so nervous.
p266_037|p266|Indeed, he does.
p266_023|p266|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p266_006|p266|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p266_012|p266|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p266_204|p266|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p266_210|p266|He seemed to lose his focus.
p266_238|p266|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p266_416|p266|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p266_370|p266|Twaddle is a case in point.
p266_364|p266|Not so, it seems.
p266_402|p266|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p266_358|p266|It was one in the afternoon.
p266_172|p266|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p266_166|p266|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p266_199|p266|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p266_198|p266|Who will pay for this?
p266_167|p266|We try to keep it right.
p266_173|p266|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p266_359|p266|We will be homeless.
p266_365|p266|He was also a great man.
p266_403|p266|So I did.
p266_417|p266|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p266_371|p266|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p266_239|p266|You can feel at home in China.
p266_211|p266|Work has started.
p266_205|p266|It had all been arranged.
p266_013|p266|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p266_007|p266|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p266_011|p266|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p266_005|p266|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p266_039|p266|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p266_213|p266|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p266_207|p266|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p266_401|p266|Emotions were complex.
p266_367|p266|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p266_373|p266|So there, we won.
p266_415|p266|He was really great.
p266_398|p266|What happened in the summer?
p266_165|p266|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p266_171|p266|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p266_159|p266|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p266_158|p266|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p266_170|p266|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p266_164|p266|We need a new kind of theatre.
p266_399|p266|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p266_372|p266|It is a simple equation.
p266_414|p266|But we finished the show.
p266_400|p266|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p266_366|p266|He could make it.
p266_206|p266|It's not before time.
p266_212|p266|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p266_038|p266|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p266_004|p266|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p266_010|p266|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p266_028|p266|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p266_014|p266|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p266_216|p266|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p266_202|p266|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p266_362|p266|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p266_404|p266|It's an absolute nonsense.
p266_410|p266|He got his degree.
p266_376|p266|There is no signature.
p266_389|p266|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p266_148|p266|It is not just about pay.
p266_160|p266|There's a pause.
p266_174|p266|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p266_175|p266|One season, they might do well.
p266_161|p266|Was this element always there?
p266_149|p266|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p266_388|p266|Does that put pressure on us?
p266_411|p266|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p266_377|p266|The task is enormous.
p266_363|p266|This is a club on the rise.
p266_405|p266|I knew the script.
p266_203|p266|He knows a lot.
p266_217|p266|Saturday is gone.
p266_001|p266|Please call Stella.  
p266_015|p266|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p266_029|p266|There's a story, too.
p266_003|p266|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p266_017|p266|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p266_229|p266|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p266_201|p266|It's all about money, money, money.
p266_215|p266|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p266_349|p266|There may be reasons for it.
p266_375|p266|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p266_413|p266|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p266_407|p266|The weekly average was three hours.
p266_361|p266|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p266_177|p266|As we worked.
p266_163|p266|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p266_188|p266|O Neill has delivered.
p266_189|p266|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p266_162|p266|I've put my own money into this project.
p266_176|p266|Is Saddam a threat?
p266_406|p266|They were kept there for a summer.
p266_360|p266|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p266_374|p266|But I managed.
p266_412|p266|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p266_348|p266|Tell us about it.
p266_214|p266|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p266_200|p266|It's just awful.
p266_228|p266|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p266_016|p266|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p266_002|p266|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p266_065|p266|Painful, but only because it's true.
p266_071|p266|Neither it is.
p266_059|p266|We should have known.
p266_267|p266|He was also married with two children.
p266_273|p266|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p266_298|p266|There was a vacuum.
p266_313|p266|The minister is the engineer.
p266_307|p266|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p266_111|p266|It was a funny game.
p266_105|p266|He takes the job.
p266_139|p266|I don't know the full story.
p266_138|p266|I was dead.
p266_104|p266|Oil embargo endorsed.
p266_110|p266|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p266_306|p266|I can give no comment.
p266_312|p266|You should be.
p266_299|p266|We lost a boy.
p266_272|p266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p266_266|p266|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p266_058|p266|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p266_070|p266|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p266_064|p266|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p266_072|p266|It is a job creation scheme.
p266_066|p266|He was at home with his pals.
p266_099|p266|Journalists should make him.
p266_270|p266|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p266_264|p266|You take a risk.
p266_258|p266|We have to expand.
p266_304|p266|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p266_310|p266|The plot is minimal.
p266_338|p266|We've tried every other way.
p266_106|p266|She reflects a bit.
p266_112|p266|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p266_113|p266|Is that right?
p266_107|p266|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p266_339|p266|This is a big advantage.
p266_311|p266|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p266_305|p266|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p266_259|p266|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p266_265|p266|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p266_271|p266|We're in shock.
p266_098|p266|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p266_067|p266|It's all I can do.
p266_073|p266|It works for us.
p266_077|p266|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p266_063|p266|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p266_088|p266|It will be tight.
p266_249|p266|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p266_275|p266|It was very fast.
p266_261|p266|Note the date.
p266_329|p266|Is there a new way forward?
p266_301|p266|I was brought up in a mining background.
p266_315|p266|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p266_103|p266|That would be unlawful.
p266_117|p266|It was the eighties.
p266_116|p266|It's a shame.
p266_102|p266|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p266_314|p266|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p266_300|p266|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p266_328|p266|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p266_260|p266|Souter will be back.
p266_274|p266|That goes back a long way.
p266_248|p266|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p266_089|p266|It is a lifeline.
p266_062|p266|Try to save us.
p266_076|p266|Today she has been released.
p266_048|p266|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p266_060|p266|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p266_074|p266|The party is up for it.
p266_262|p266|It will be done in stages.
p266_276|p266|She failed in her action.
p266_289|p266|It was good.
p266_316|p266|Your father was a good man.
p266_302|p266|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p266_128|p266|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p266_114|p266|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p266_100|p266|May not have been at fault?
p266_101|p266|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p266_115|p266|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p266_129|p266|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p266_303|p266|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p266_317|p266|We are a peaceful people.
p266_288|p266|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p266_277|p266|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p266_263|p266|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p266_075|p266|Even the one she loved.
p266_061|p266|We recorded it at our own expense.
p266_049|p266|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p292_079|p292|It was very full anyway.
p292_086|p292|I am constantly changing my mind.
p292_092|p292|His presence was very important.
p292_247|p292|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p292_253|p292|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p292_284|p292|He has changed my life forever.
p292_290|p292|He already had had complaints.
p292_333|p292|It is out there.
p292_327|p292|They always seem to produce.
p292_131|p292|It is a terrible loss.
p292_125|p292|Britain has never had it so good.
p292_119|p292|I was influenced by all of these things.
p292_118|p292|We have no knowledge of this.
p292_124|p292|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p292_130|p292|I had a train to catch.
p292_326|p292|My whole life has changed.
p292_332|p292|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p292_291|p292|For that much we must be grateful.
p292_285|p292|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p292_252|p292|This could prove a problem.
p292_246|p292|It starts to get you down.
p292_093|p292|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p292_087|p292|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p292_078|p292|THERE's only one word for it.
p292_050|p292|What is the new religion?
p292_044|p292|The idea has potential for the future.
p292_052|p292|It was all for good reason as well.
p292_046|p292|That was not due to me.
p292_091|p292|It was that kind of afternoon.
p292_085|p292|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p292_250|p292|I have played well the past two days.
p292_244|p292|There is great demand for human cloning.
p292_278|p292|It has been only average.
p292_293|p292|They are the heroes.
p292_287|p292|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p292_324|p292|The whole family was in shock.
p292_330|p292|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p292_318|p292|Is he going to look after them?
p292_126|p292|We are under no illusions about this.
p292_132|p292|What's happening to her?
p292_133|p292|It was even worse than at home.
p292_127|p292|But the killer remains at large.
p292_319|p292|He had no answer.
p292_331|p292|The company's in good shape.
p292_325|p292|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p292_286|p292|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p292_292|p292|Spent three months alone at sea.
p292_279|p292|He should be worried about me.
p292_245|p292|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p292_251|p292|I said, What was that about?
p292_084|p292|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p292_090|p292|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p292_047|p292|Structural changes were also required.
p292_053|p292|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p292_057|p292|One woman refused to sit down.
p292_043|p292|Mr Blair should be warned.
p292_094|p292|He insisted that his staff were too.
p292_080|p292|That was him under pressure.
p292_269|p292|It is a very beautiful city.
p292_255|p292|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p292_241|p292|It is up to us to approve it.
p292_296|p292|Three hours later, the man was free.
p292_282|p292|That was the gimmick.
p292_309|p292|It's only tackling congestion.
p292_321|p292|Special measures were needed.
p292_335|p292|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p292_123|p292|They will run a mile.
p292_137|p292|I still think he will win.
p292_136|p292|We cannot lose it.
p292_122|p292|It certainly should not be used too often.
p292_334|p292|This country has many challenges.
p292_320|p292|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p292_308|p292|But let's not get carried away.
p292_283|p292|This is a national crisis.
p292_297|p292|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p292_240|p292|Nothing can bring back their son.
p292_254|p292|His game was complete.
p292_268|p292|Inquiries are still in an early stage.
p292_081|p292|I can't believe she is dead.
p292_095|p292|They should come clean.
p292_042|p292|It doesn't come any better than this.
p292_056|p292|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p292_068|p292|His record with England was not good.
p292_040|p292|I wish the solutions were as easy.
p292_054|p292|I'm trying not to think about that.
p292_083|p292|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p292_097|p292|That, though, is an old story.
p292_242|p292|His musicals were very much of their time.
p292_256|p292|This is too much like Scotland.
p292_281|p292|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p292_295|p292|They are in good spirits.
p292_336|p292|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p292_322|p292|Your father was a good man.
p292_108|p292|Seven people were later detained by police.
p292_134|p292|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p292_120|p292|Is my wife a racist?
p292_121|p292|This would not be my first choice.
p292_135|p292|The plane was in flames
p292_109|p292|It's nice to be involved.
p292_323|p292|You do that because you want to win.
p292_337|p292|To begin with it looks good.
p292_294|p292|That will be the key to success.
p292_280|p292|That never happens in real life.
p292_257|p292|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p292_243|p292|They might well be right.
p292_096|p292|Let's see that increase over the years.
p292_082|p292|I was in prison for a year.
p292_055|p292|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p292_041|p292|She does not see anything ever changing.
p292_069|p292|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p292_026|p292|O, Is he conscious?
p292_032|p292|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
p292_224|p292|No means testing will be required.
p292_230|p292|If only he knew himself.
p292_218|p292|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p292_350|p292|What's the problem with change?
p292_344|p292|The boat was fantastic.
p292_422|p292|We didn't get any from his face.
p292_378|p292|That would have killed the match.
p292_393|p292|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p292_387|p292|Billy knew he was attracted to women.
p292_152|p292|This is the root of their problems.
p292_146|p292|I suggest a new plan.
p292_191|p292|I have nothing to hide.
p292_185|p292|He had come of age.
p292_184|p292|We didn't think anything would happen.
p292_190|p292|A crucial moment has arrived.
p292_147|p292|IT takes the biscuit.
p292_153|p292|Other forces were, however, at work.
p292_386|p292|He is just a wonderful actor.
p292_392|p292|It's a true story.
p292_379|p292|That's not like us at all.
p292_345|p292|Donald was his friend.
p292_423|p292|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p292_351|p292|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p292_219|p292|We're looking for unity in the council.
p292_231|p292|This action could have been avoided.
p292_225|p292|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p292_033|p292|Or it's not really for us, if you like.
p292_027|p292|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p292_031|p292|Three days later, he was killed.
p292_025|p292|I was not involved in these discussions.
p292_233|p292|Anyone else can apply.
p292_227|p292|He was on a horse.
p292_421|p292|He was back to square one.
p292_347|p292|The girls are ready to compete.
p292_353|p292|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p292_409|p292|It is good for Europe.
p292_384|p292|This season has been a nightmare.
p292_390|p292|This was not helpful.
p292_145|p292|I have a great respect for her.
p292_151|p292|The result is utterly compelling.
p292_179|p292|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p292_186|p292|We were a shambles at the back.
p292_192|p292|Next time round, it will be different.
p292_193|p292|How can they get one?
p292_187|p292|It's not before time.
p292_178|p292|Only one person can claim the credit.
p292_150|p292|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p292_144|p292|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p292_391|p292|The police are not the target.
p292_385|p292|Everyone could see the joke.
p292_408|p292|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p292_352|p292|There are moments of silence.
p292_420|p292|You can cope with it.
p292_346|p292|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p292_226|p292|I don't think that's very fair.
p292_232|p292|I watched a game.
p292_024|p292|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p292_030|p292|I thought the game was very poor.
p292_034|p292|It was a deceit.
p292_020|p292|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p292_236|p292|The first time you read a play.
p292_222|p292|It's up to the defence team.
p292_418|p292|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p292_342|p292|I had to win this race.
p292_424|p292|It's time for a change.
p292_356|p292|It is time for a new approach.
p292_381|p292|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p292_395|p292|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p292_168|p292|It's been a good year.
p292_140|p292|I've got to get on with my career.
p292_154|p292|He also has property interests in the country.
p292_183|p292|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p292_197|p292|This is my homeland.
p292_196|p292|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p292_182|p292|We will reform the welfare state.
p292_155|p292|That takes time and games and practice.
p292_141|p292|It is a road of death.
p292_169|p292|I was never alone with her, right?
p292_394|p292|But that title is a mistake.
p292_380|p292|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p292_357|p292|Now they have decided to have a rethink.
p292_343|p292|And right now, it isn't there.
p292_419|p292|But a surprise is in store.
p292_223|p292|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p292_237|p292|I was a little surprised.
p292_021|p292|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p292_035|p292|You are in power.
p292_023|p292|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p292_037|p292|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p292_209|p292|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p292_221|p292|You cannot allow it to go on.
p292_235|p292|This was never a support group.
p292_369|p292|I'm delighted for Andy.
p292_355|p292|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p292_341|p292|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p292_396|p292|I'd rather have been playing.
p292_382|p292|You have to rely on each other.
p292_157|p292|It is a new company for Scotland.
p292_143|p292|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p292_194|p292|Only local people are helping.
p292_180|p292|O Neill has delivered.
p292_181|p292|But there was no going back.
p292_195|p292|We had to work hard for it.
p292_142|p292|Now we look forward to it.
p292_156|p292|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p292_383|p292|Politics is a tough game.
p292_397|p292|I am immensely sad.
p292_340|p292|The review has been conducted fairly.
p292_354|p292|The board of governors must act.
p292_368|p292|That's why he is a national treasure.
p292_234|p292|It was like the old days.
p292_220|p292|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p292_208|p292|We've got better players here.
p292_036|p292|PR will be just one of them.
p292_022|p292|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p292_013|p292|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p292_205|p292|I have no conflict with them.
p292_211|p292|People have no chance of getting out.
p292_239|p292|That was six years ago.
p292_417|p292|I will always remember the horrible images.
p292_371|p292|It's their duty to protect them.
p292_365|p292|And does it even matter?
p292_403|p292|I knew she was going to win.
p292_359|p292|There's no choice is there?
p292_173|p292|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p292_167|p292|It was the first time they met.
p292_198|p292|You saw the pain he was in.
p292_199|p292|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p292_166|p292|We want to replicate that success.
p292_172|p292|It's just a normal life.
p292_358|p292|Tiger is the exception.
p292_364|p292|Everything was an effort.
p292_402|p292|We all thought we were going to die.
p292_416|p292|A venue was found.
p292_370|p292|And how he kept his word.
p292_238|p292|This is my home town.
p292_210|p292|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p292_204|p292|She made no further comment.
p292_038|p292|It is just like the stock market.
p292_212|p292|I am appalled by this news.
p292_206|p292|The next one comes up.
p292_400|p292|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p292_366|p292|My parents are exhausted.
p292_372|p292|The Cup has come home.
p292_414|p292|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p292_399|p292|It is surprising to come back this way.
p292_164|p292|These are serious matters.
p292_170|p292|That will be vital.
p292_158|p292|We should have gone solo.
p292_159|p292|We don't even know his name.
p292_171|p292|It's a technical demand.
p292_165|p292|Are you all right at the front?
p292_398|p292|Several others were absent.
p292_373|p292|This is a big, big win.
p292_415|p292|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p292_401|p292|Could they perhaps be related?
p292_367|p292|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p292_207|p292|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p292_213|p292|We were extremely arrogant.
p292_039|p292|And the newspapers were full of it.
p292_029|p292|IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
p292_015|p292|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p292_001|p292|Please call Stella.
p292_217|p292|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p292_203|p292|It has affected me.
p292_363|p292|Glasgow is far from overload.
p292_405|p292|Clark is back on top form.
p292_411|p292|Colour was at the core of his life.
p292_377|p292|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p292_388|p292|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
p292_149|p292|You're not going to forget something like that.
p292_161|p292|It is about the script for me.
p292_175|p292|He is the example for all of us.
p292_174|p292|This is a very high price.
p292_160|p292|They have known the hard times.
p292_148|p292|But we are not immune to the problem.
p292_389|p292|Such cases are on the increase.
p292_410|p292|I am looking forward to this film.
p292_376|p292|We were given a break.
p292_362|p292|You can't give in to the vandals.
p292_404|p292|What is the Barnett formula?
p292_202|p292|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p292_216|p292|I am proud of moments like that.
p292_014|p292|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p292_028|p292|They are being deported from their homes.
p292_016|p292|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p292_228|p292|Human beings are always the same.
p292_200|p292|Drugs are always an issue.
p292_214|p292|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p292_348|p292|It gives us something to work on.
p292_374|p292|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
p292_412|p292|They would not tell us.
p292_406|p292|A suspicion was not enough.
p292_360|p292|Does it, Noel?
p292_176|p292|There is no way to do this.
p292_162|p292|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p292_189|p292|It is a very sad day.
p292_188|p292|One of these problems is the railways.
p292_163|p292|The president will not be removed from office.
p292_177|p292|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p292_407|p292|It will probably be my last, too.
p292_361|p292|Do not forget about Monaco.
p292_375|p292|That's an equally important factor.
p292_413|p292|The balance is all wrong in this country.
p292_349|p292|It was all too little, too late.
p292_215|p292|I was just getting over the time difference.
p292_201|p292|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p292_229|p292|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p292_017|p292|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p292_064|p292|You can see how he made his money.
p292_070|p292|Three penalties were given.
p292_058|p292|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p292_266|p292|Have we not been here before?
p292_272|p292|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p292_299|p292|I'm going to miss it.
p292_312|p292|Friends of the family have given their support.
p292_306|p292|His descent was pathetic.
p292_110|p292|There could still be some to come forward.
p292_104|p292|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p292_138|p292|Elections would follow in about two years.
p292_139|p292|However, this idea is never developed.
p292_105|p292|What did we learn?
p292_111|p292|What are they like?
p292_307|p292|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p292_313|p292|This means a great deal to the families.
p292_298|p292|I wonder if Rangers do that?
p292_273|p292|The issues are very intense.
p292_267|p292|Just what we didn't need.
p292_059|p292|I was completely knackered.
p292_071|p292|I didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292_065|p292|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p292_073|p292|We are just being flooded.
p292_067|p292|We tend to come good at the end.
p292_098|p292|The real issue is personal.
p292_271|p292|The company reacted very, very well.
p292_265|p292|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p292_259|p292|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p292_305|p292|It may have been a cry for help.
p292_311|p292|We've seen that time and time again.
p292_339|p292|This was a unique election.
p292_107|p292|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p292_113|p292|The squad is too small.
p292_112|p292|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p292_106|p292|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p292_338|p292|They are with their father.
p292_310|p292|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p292_304|p292|Our task is to complete the picture.
p292_258|p292|That goes back a long way.
p292_264|p292|However, by then the damage had been done.
p292_270|p292|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p292_099|p292|Life becomes a song.
p292_066|p292|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p292_072|p292|He was between people and God.
p292_076|p292|There were no proposals on the table.
p292_062|p292|Last night, the row continued.
p292_089|p292|But he just carried on anyway.
p292_248|p292|My life has been turned upside down.
p292_274|p292|It won't be their last.
p292_260|p292|They were not at the property yesterday.
p292_328|p292|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p292_300|p292|The atmosphere was excellent.
p292_314|p292|They said that they stood by their statement.
p292_102|p292|So far this season this approach is working.
p292_116|p292|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p292_117|p292|They offered to make an investment into it.
p292_103|p292|I have got a knife.
p292_315|p292|It should be equal.
p292_301|p292|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p292_329|p292|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p292_261|p292|We will not tolerate it.
p292_275|p292|You've got to have both sides.
p292_249|p292|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p292_088|p292|Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292_063|p292|Our approach will be different.
p292_077|p292|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p292_049|p292|The racist abuse was terrible.
p292_061|p292|A killer is also on the loose.
p292_075|p292|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p292_263|p292|They loved it and it showed.
p292_277|p292|Dialogue is the key.
p292_288|p292|However, we had no failures in our side.
p292_317|p292|He was always nice to me.
p292_303|p292|One was a lawyer.
p292_129|p292|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p292_115|p292|I'm just going to do my best.
p292_101|p292|I've learned from my mistakes.
p292_100|p292|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p292_114|p292|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p292_128|p292|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p292_302|p292|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p292_316|p292|We are on a four-year mission.
p292_289|p292|This is his first movie.
p292_276|p292|I'll tell you honestly.
p292_262|p292|It should not make the same mistake again.
p292_074|p292|We could easily have lost that game.
p292_060|p292|There are two interests in this woodland.
p292_048|p292|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p234_188|p234|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p234_361|p234|We never played at all.
p234_349|p234|We are not interested in dividends.
p234_201|p234|They have to get that sorted.
p234_229|p234|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
p234_003|p234|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p234_017|p234|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p234_016|p234|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p234_002|p234|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p234_228|p234|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p234_214|p234|This is an interesting link.
p234_200|p234|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p234_348|p234|The answer was in space.
p234_360|p234|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p234_189|p234|It is simply not true.
p234_162|p234|In that case, the children were not missing.
p234_176|p234|I was in a hole.
p234_160|p234|There is no common ground.
p234_174|p234|That was the difference between the sides.
p234_148|p234|It is expected to last a week.
p234_216|p234|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p234_202|p234|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
p234_014|p234|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p234_028|p234|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p234_029|p234|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p234_001|p234|Please call Stella.  
p234_015|p234|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p234_203|p234|We can take the city.
p234_217|p234|Being investor ready is a good start.
p234_149|p234|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p234_175|p234|They have not been named.
p234_161|p234|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p234_159|p234|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p234_165|p234|Anyone can do the sums.
p234_171|p234|Much of the equipment was new.
p234_213|p234|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p234_207|p234|What do we want to do that for?
p234_039|p234|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p234_005|p234|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p234_004|p234|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p234_010|p234|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p234_038|p234|Victory was never in doubt.
p234_212|p234|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p234_170|p234|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p234_164|p234|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p234_158|p234|The players were under pressure.
p234_172|p234|I have had a good life.
p234_166|p234|At the moment we do not understand it.
p234_199|p234|I could not sit in the stands.
p234_358|p234|Something is going to have to give.
p234_238|p234|I was not overly concerned about this.
p234_204|p234|Are you going to win?
p234_210|p234|It was the story of the second half.
p234_006|p234|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p234_012|p234|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p234_013|p234|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p234_007|p234|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p234_211|p234|The trading conditions are not good.
p234_205|p234|Was it the wife?
p234_239|p234|However, it is not as simple as this.
p234_359|p234|There's still a bit to go.
p234_198|p234|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p234_167|p234|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p234_173|p234|Three hours later, the man was free.
p234_114|p234|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p234_100|p234|It should be a condition of employment.
p234_128|p234|The end result is the same.
p234_316|p234|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
p234_302|p234|But it was also hard.
p234_262|p234|His second was a beauty.
p234_276|p234|The performance continues to improve.
p234_289|p234|Are they free?
p234_060|p234|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p234_074|p234|We were under a bit of pressure.
p234_048|p234|It is all starting to come together.
p234_049|p234|Part of the complex is historic.
p234_075|p234|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p234_061|p234|You have to be patient.
p234_288|p234|What form did that take?
p234_277|p234|That would be a danger.
p234_263|p234|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p234_303|p234|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p234_317|p234|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p234_129|p234|Three days later, he was killed.
p234_101|p234|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p234_115|p234|She is not a victim.
p234_103|p234|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p234_117|p234|And we had a good response.
p234_301|p234|But that's another story for another day.
p234_315|p234|They have set the standard.
p234_329|p234|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
p234_275|p234|The statement contained no surprises.
p234_261|p234|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p234_249|p234|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
p234_077|p234|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p234_063|p234|That could be a mistake.
p234_088|p234|Do I have a favourite?
p234_089|p234|What do we do?
p234_062|p234|That is all in the past.
p234_076|p234|We can all make a mistake.
p234_248|p234|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p234_260|p234|They are difficult awards to decide.
p234_274|p234|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p234_328|p234|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p234_314|p234|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p234_300|p234|And it was this one.
p234_116|p234|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p234_102|p234|It is much as it has been described.
p234_106|p234|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p234_112|p234|That would be a serious problem.
p234_338|p234|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p234_304|p234|We're looking for unity in the council.
p234_310|p234|Scotland won by six wickets.
p234_258|p234|I am delighted for them.
p234_270|p234|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p234_264|p234|Scotland played a major part in the project.
p234_072|p234|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p234_066|p234|He has not been dropped.
p234_099|p234|That is the fact of the matter.
p234_098|p234|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p234_067|p234|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p234_073|p234|It starts with the script.
p234_265|p234|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p234_271|p234|Well, it was certainly different.
p234_259|p234|It was a great experience.
p234_311|p234|It has to be enforced.
p234_305|p234|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p234_339|p234|I think the overall picture is still strong.
p234_113|p234|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
p234_107|p234|Everyone had to play the game.
p234_139|p234|Are you from the rugby?
p234_111|p234|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
p234_105|p234|He has become a monster.
p234_313|p234|Every one is a winner.
p234_307|p234|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p234_267|p234|We can certainly build on this.
p234_273|p234|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p234_298|p234|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p234_059|p234|There was no safety net.
p234_065|p234|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p234_071|p234|She did that for the rest of her life.
p234_070|p234|This time, it might be for real.
p234_064|p234|It was an amazing result.
p234_058|p234|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p234_299|p234|We were well worth the win.
p234_272|p234|We want this place to work.
p234_266|p234|Not in this production he doesn't.
p234_306|p234|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p234_312|p234|And we can do it.
p234_104|p234|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p234_110|p234|We are currently working on the details.
p234_138|p234|And does it?
p234_135|p234|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p234_121|p234|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p234_109|p234|It is not affected by the sale.
p234_337|p234|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p234_323|p234|And he's the real thing.
p234_243|p234|Was everything done to save people?
p234_257|p234|The matter is under appeal.
p234_280|p234|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p234_294|p234|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p234_041|p234|I have never been a member of the council.
p234_055|p234|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p234_069|p234|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
p234_082|p234|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p234_096|p234|I had a bit in hand.
p234_097|p234|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p234_083|p234|They were badly prepared for it.
p234_068|p234|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p234_054|p234|We are working on it.
p234_040|p234|We are the party of the future.
p234_295|p234|He was good, but not that good.
p234_281|p234|I had to be into it.
p234_256|p234|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p234_242|p234|And they were being paid?
p234_322|p234|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p234_336|p234|This could be a mistake.
p234_108|p234|In London today, it was business as usual.
p234_120|p234|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p234_134|p234|It is not so simple.
p234_122|p234|That admission is not surprising.
p234_136|p234|So, did she meet him?
p234_320|p234|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
p234_334|p234|We have to be very, very careful.
p234_308|p234|The concerns are the same.
p234_254|p234|From there, they can go anywhere.
p234_240|p234|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p234_268|p234|Then was the summer of their discontent.
p234_297|p234|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p234_283|p234|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p234_056|p234|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p234_042|p234|He was in his element.
p234_095|p234|By then, he was walking on water.
p234_081|p234|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p234_080|p234|On the night, it was not enough.
p234_094|p234|The Festival is prepared to help.
p234_043|p234|That means an extra two years.
p234_057|p234|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p234_282|p234|My view has always been the same.
p234_296|p234|The results are expected within days.
p234_269|p234|There is a world of difference.
p234_241|p234|A deadline is still essential.
p234_255|p234|The world is a good place.
p234_309|p234|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p234_335|p234|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p234_321|p234|You have to count on other people.
p234_137|p234|So what is the campaign about?
p234_123|p234|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p234_127|p234|However, it was a different story in the final.
p234_133|p234|He had no money left to run the club.
p234_319|p234|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p234_325|p234|Is there a waiting list?
p234_331|p234|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p234_279|p234|However, no further action was taken by police.
p234_251|p234|We have an election in eight days.
p234_245|p234|Do I think about them often?
p234_292|p234|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p234_286|p234|Is our children learning?
p234_053|p234|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p234_047|p234|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p234_090|p234|Why do it otherwise?
p234_084|p234|It is not a story.
p234_085|p234|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p234_091|p234|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p234_046|p234|The man became a reporter.
p234_052|p234|I was released after six days.
p234_287|p234|How independent is that?
p234_293|p234|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p234_244|p234|What was the matter for concern?
p234_250|p234|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p234_278|p234|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p234_330|p234|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p234_324|p234|What are they for?
p234_318|p234|The existing structure is in trouble.
p234_132|p234|The problem was a social problem.
p234_126|p234|He wanted to record the group.
p234_118|p234|When we looked at the company.
p234_130|p234|We are committed to the ban.
p234_124|p234|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p234_332|p234|But it can be done.
p234_326|p234|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p234_246|p234|Is it in the right place?
p234_252|p234|It was far from business as usual.
p234_285|p234|Do you think we're a top nation?
p234_291|p234|In many ways, that is as important.
p234_044|p234|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p234_050|p234|The strategy is not without risk.
p234_087|p234|So is that it, then?
p234_093|p234|He is in the US.
p234_092|p234|They have a further report to make in March.
p234_086|p234|How are you, sir?
p234_051|p234|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p234_045|p234|All businesses continue to trade.
p234_079|p234|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p234_290|p234|The party has never fully recovered.
p234_284|p234|It is set in Paris.
p234_253|p234|It was just another play.
p234_247|p234|Did he trip?
p234_327|p234|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p234_333|p234|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p234_125|p234|There was a lot of resentment.
p234_131|p234|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p234_119|p234|No, the equipment is extra.
p234_156|p234|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p234_142|p234|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p234_195|p234|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p234_181|p234|He was asked to quit.
p234_354|p234|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p234_340|p234|That is always a problem.
p234_220|p234|This conference was never confirmed.
p234_234|p234|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p234_208|p234|Does the name matter?
p234_022|p234|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p234_036|p234|It was sold at a loss.
p234_037|p234|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p234_023|p234|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p234_209|p234|I will be in Scotland.
p234_235|p234|The conference is the first test.
p234_221|p234|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p234_341|p234|We will deliver at director level.
p234_355|p234|However, a bid was never made.
p234_180|p234|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p234_194|p234|It would make a lot of sense.
p234_143|p234|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p234_157|p234|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
p234_141|p234|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p234_155|p234|We want to get there.
p234_169|p234|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p234_182|p234|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p234_196|p234|Clearly, they had other problems.
p234_343|p234|The market is the market.
p234_357|p234|The City welcomed the numbers.
p234_237|p234|But we are not immune to the problem.
p234_223|p234|He must have a crack at it.
p234_035|p234|History is in the making.
p234_021|p234|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p234_009|p234|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p234_008|p234|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p234_020|p234|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p234_034|p234|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p234_222|p234|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p234_236|p234|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p234_356|p234|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p234_342|p234|We did something about it.
p234_197|p234|He has defended the system.
p234_183|p234|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p234_168|p234|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p234_154|p234|There is a spring in the step.
p234_140|p234|Actors like to be in the centre.
p234_178|p234|I was always in control.
p234_144|p234|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p234_150|p234|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p234_187|p234|As, indeed, they would be.
p234_193|p234|The performance is not there.
p234_346|p234|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p234_352|p234|And it's a goodbye from him.
p234_232|p234|It is the strength of the school.
p234_226|p234|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p234_018|p234|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p234_030|p234|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p234_024|p234|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p234_025|p234|We are a service industry.
p234_031|p234|It is on the internet.
p234_019|p234|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p234_227|p234|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p234_233|p234|But it may not be all bad news.
p234_353|p234|They have to be addressed.
p234_347|p234|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p234_192|p234|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p234_186|p234|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
p234_151|p234|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p234_145|p234|I can't even get into the A team.
p234_179|p234|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p234_153|p234|That is the nature of the game.
p234_147|p234|She does not want to speak.
p234_190|p234|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
p234_184|p234|They were not seeking the right to strike.
p234_351|p234|His concern is only for the future.
p234_345|p234|However, the devil is in the detail.
p234_219|p234|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p234_225|p234|Her experience is certainly limited.
p234_231|p234|He is a good friend.
p234_027|p234|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p234_033|p234|This is a central issue.
p234_032|p234|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p234_026|p234|But we will have to wait.
p234_230|p234|He intends to restart in the spring.
p234_224|p234|The force is with them.
p234_218|p234|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p234_344|p234|We do not have the papers.
p234_350|p234|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p234_185|p234|He called for a public inquiry.
p234_191|p234|It is not in the public interest.
p234_146|p234|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p234_152|p234|But it is different in different regions.
p233_309|p233|We want to play at the worlds.
p233_137|p233|I am now unemployed.
p233_123|p233|Who would be a referee?
p233_080|p233|On the night, it was not enough.
p233_094|p233|The Festival is prepared to help.
p233_043|p233|That means an extra two years.
p233_057|p233|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p233_282|p233|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p233_296|p233|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p233_241|p233|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p233_255|p233|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p233_269|p233|They are never here.
p233_268|p233|Blood samples were taken.
p233_254|p233|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p233_240|p233|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p233_297|p233|Who can predict?
p233_283|p233|I feel pretty good.
p233_056|p233|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p233_042|p233|He was in his element.
p233_095|p233|By then, he was walking on water.
p233_081|p233|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p233_122|p233|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p233_136|p233|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p233_308|p233|I was in daily contact.
p233_320|p233|My view has now completely changed.
p233_334|p233|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p233_322|p233|We agreed to disagree.
p233_336|p233|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p233_120|p233|I'm delighted about that.
p233_134|p233|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p233_108|p233|In London today, it was business as usual.
p233_097|p233|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p233_083|p233|They were badly prepared for it.
p233_054|p233|We are working on it.
p233_040|p233|We are the party of the future.
p233_068|p233|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p233_295|p233|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p233_281|p233|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p233_256|p233|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p233_242|p233|We were extremely poor.
p233_243|p233|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p233_257|p233|I watched a game.
p233_280|p233|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p233_294|p233|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p233_041|p233|I have never been a member of the council.
p233_055|p233|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p233_082|p233|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p233_096|p233|I had a bit in hand.
p233_109|p233|It is not affected by the sale.
p233_135|p233|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p233_121|p233|I joined a group.
p233_337|p233|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p233_323|p233|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p233_327|p233|It added to the spectacle.
p233_333|p233|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p233_119|p233|My office is bare.
p233_125|p233|That's all right then.
p233_131|p233|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p233_092|p233|They have a further report to make in March.
p233_086|p233|How are you, sir?
p233_079|p233|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233_051|p233|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p233_045|p233|All businesses continue to trade.
p233_290|p233|All options are open.
p233_284|p233|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p233_253|p233|This year I understood.
p233_247|p233|The salary changes are long overdue.
p233_246|p233|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p233_252|p233|A friendship that will endure.
p233_285|p233|It was a privilege to work for him.
p233_291|p233|The attacker died in the crash.
p233_044|p233|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p233_050|p233|The strategy is not without risk.
p233_087|p233|So is that it, then?
p233_093|p233|He is in the US.
p233_130|p233|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p233_118|p233|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p233_332|p233|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p233_326|p233|Robert is a special talent.
p233_330|p233|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p233_324|p233|I saw some good things.
p233_132|p233|He's been the key to everything.
p233_126|p233|There were no grounds for his action.
p233_085|p233|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p233_091|p233|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p233_046|p233|The man became a reporter.
p233_052|p233|I was released after six days.
p233_278|p233|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p233_244|p233|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p233_250|p233|There wasn't a goal.
p233_251|p233|It was a cry for help.
p233_245|p233|I know I'm in a very special position.
p233_279|p233|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p233_292|p233|It was a virus.
p233_286|p233|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p233_053|p233|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p233_047|p233|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p233_090|p233|Why do it otherwise?
p233_084|p233|It is not a story.
p233_127|p233|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p233_133|p233|It's an amazing landscape!
p233_325|p233|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p233_331|p233|Who will do it?
p233_319|p233|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p233_381|p233|It's just outrageous.
p233_356|p233|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p233_342|p233|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p233_197|p233|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p233_183|p233|I always felt they played for me.
p233_154|p233|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p233_140|p233|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p233_168|p233|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p233_020|p233|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p233_008|p233|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p233_222|p233|Work has started.
p233_236|p233|I can't wait to meet him.
p233_237|p233|Broke the birdie record.
p233_223|p233|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p233_009|p233|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p233_021|p233|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p233_169|p233|It is so unfair.
p233_141|p233|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
p233_155|p233|He will emerge as a world leader.
p233_182|p233|He will feel the pain again.
p233_196|p233|I had a train to catch.
p233_343|p233|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p233_357|p233|Equity declined to comment.
p233_382|p233|The road was closed for several hours.
p233_341|p233|The composer will conduct.
p233_355|p233|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p233_369|p233|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p233_180|p233|We've made a couple of albums.
p233_194|p233|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p233_143|p233|Is that it?
p233_157|p233|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p233_037|p233|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p233_023|p233|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p233_235|p233|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p233_221|p233|The FBI could become involved.
p233_209|p233|I have a cold.
p233_208|p233|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p233_220|p233|In each case they were a goal down.
p233_234|p233|My neighbours are horrified.
p233_022|p233|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p233_156|p233|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p233_142|p233|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p233_195|p233|It's a joke.
p233_181|p233|They thought they had found a home.
p233_368|p233|Colour was at the core of his life.
p233_354|p233|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p233_340|p233|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p233_383|p233|It is unusual.
p233_387|p233|It was a breathtaking moment.
p233_378|p233|The mood was defiant.
p233_344|p233|His contract was then not renewed.
p233_350|p233|However, it was well worth the wait.
p233_185|p233|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p233_191|p233|There is no point in looking any further.
p233_146|p233|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p233_152|p233|It is like a football team.
p233_032|p233|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p233_026|p233|But we will have to wait.
p233_218|p233|His third goal was superb.
p233_230|p233|We played them off the pitch.
p233_224|p233|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p233_225|p233|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p233_231|p233|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p233_027|p233|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p233_033|p233|This is a central issue.
p233_153|p233|It would be a last resort.
p233_147|p233|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p233_190|p233|I was totally wrong.
p233_184|p233|Is Saddam a threat?
p233_351|p233|He agreed with my proposal.
p233_345|p233|Eight months later, he was dead.
p233_379|p233|Yet the data is compelling.
p233_392|p233|He has not created a Festival resource.
p233_386|p233|That set the tone.
p233_390|p233|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p233_384|p233|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p233_353|p233|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p233_347|p233|He had played well in that central role.
p233_192|p233|I've been there.
p233_186|p233|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p233_179|p233|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p233_151|p233|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p233_019|p233|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p233_025|p233|We are a service industry.
p233_233|p233|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p233_232|p233|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.

p233_150|p233|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p233_178|p233|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p233_187|p233|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p233_193|p233|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p233_346|p233|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p233_352|p233|Hartley should know.
p233_385|p233|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p233_391|p233|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p233_388|p233|I was in jail for five years.
p233_377|p233|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p233_363|p233|Safety was also an issue.
p233_175|p233|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p233_161|p233|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p233_149|p233|She died at her home.
p233_001|p233|Please call Stella.  
p233_015|p233|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p233_029|p233|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p233_203|p233|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p233_217|p233|I had relied on him.
p233_216|p233|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p233_028|p233|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p233_014|p233|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p233_148|p233|Who would be right?
p233_160|p233|I was so nervous.
p233_174|p233|It's that sort of night.
p233_362|p233|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p233_376|p233|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p233_389|p233|What happened in the summer?
p233_360|p233|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p233_374|p233|He's a nice guy.
p233_348|p233|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p233_189|p233|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p233_162|p233|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p233_176|p233|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p233_016|p233|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p233_002|p233|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p233_214|p233|That will be vital.
p233_200|p233|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p233_228|p233|Mental health is a massive issue.
p233_229|p233|You have to do your research.
p233_201|p233|He may need it.
p233_215|p233|We need to handle it.
p233_003|p233|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p233_017|p233|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p233_177|p233|The release attracted little attention.
p233_163|p233|It is not normal practice.
p233_188|p233|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p233_349|p233|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p233_375|p233|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p233_361|p233|They have not done so this season so far.
p233_359|p233|He could make it.
p233_365|p233|But I managed.
p233_371|p233|We shall not be moved.
p233_198|p233|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p233_167|p233|Neither side can win this war.
p233_173|p233|I have got a wife to feed.
p233_013|p233|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p233_007|p233|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p233_239|p233|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p233_211|p233|A deadline is still essential.
p233_204|p233|It wasn't to be.
p233_210|p233|He had suffered a heart attack.
p233_238|p233|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p233_006|p233|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p233_012|p233|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p233_172|p233|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p233_166|p233|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p233_199|p233|However, this idea is never developed.
p233_370|p233|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p233_364|p233|They received a reply from their own managers.
p233_358|p233|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p233_366|p233|They play together perfectly.
p233_158|p233|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p233_170|p233|I will tell you.
p233_164|p233|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p233_038|p233|Victory was never in doubt.
p233_004|p233|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p233_212|p233|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p233_213|p233|It was worth a photograph.
p233_011|p233|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p233_005|p233|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p233_039|p233|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p233_165|p233|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p233_171|p233|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p233_159|p233|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p233_367|p233|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p233_373|p233|It was a hit.
p233_314|p233|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p233_300|p233|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p233_328|p233|Who was the mystery MP?
p233_116|p233|You had better believe it.
p233_102|p233|It is much as it has been described.
p233_089|p233|What do we do?
p233_062|p233|That is all in the past.
p233_076|p233|We can all make a mistake.
p233_260|p233|I was happily surprised.
p233_274|p233|He is a young man with a new deal.
p233_248|p233|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p233_249|p233|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p233_275|p233|It was an easy decision to come here.
p233_261|p233|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p233_077|p233|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p233_063|p233|That could be a mistake.
p233_088|p233|Do I have a favourite?
p233_103|p233|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p233_117|p233|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p233_329|p233|He told the court.
p233_301|p233|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p233_315|p233|The problems began a long time ago.
p233_303|p233|One was a lawyer.
p233_317|p233|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p233_101|p233|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p233_115|p233|We do not expect any surplus.
p233_129|p233|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p233_075|p233|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p233_061|p233|You have to be patient.
p233_049|p233|Part of the complex is historic.
p233_288|p233|They were too hard.
p233_277|p233|And Michael was just great.
p233_263|p233|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p233_262|p233|It is also very valuable.
p233_276|p233|It is the same in Sweden.
p233_289|p233|He looked very sharp.
p233_048|p233|It is all starting to come together.
p233_060|p233|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p233_074|p233|We were under a bit of pressure.
p233_128|p233|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p233_114|p233|It was the eighties.
p233_100|p233|It should be a condition of employment.
p233_316|p233|My body is clearly capable.
p233_302|p233|I thought it was my only chance.
p233_306|p233|This is a war over our home.
p233_312|p233|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p233_138|p233|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p233_104|p233|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p233_110|p233|We are currently working on the details.
p233_058|p233|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p233_070|p233|This time, it might be for real.
p233_064|p233|It was an amazing result.
p233_299|p233|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p233_272|p233|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p233_266|p233|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p233_267|p233|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p233_273|p233|Immediate action must be taken.
p233_298|p233|This is a huge confidence boost.
p233_065|p233|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p233_071|p233|She did that for the rest of her life.
p233_059|p233|There was no safety net.
p233_111|p233|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p233_105|p233|He has become a monster.
p233_139|p233|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p233_313|p233|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p233_307|p233|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p233_339|p233|I've learned from my mistakes.
p233_311|p233|Is there on his hands?
p233_305|p233|They should be swept away.
p233_113|p233|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p233_107|p233|Everyone had to play the game.
p233_098|p233|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p233_067|p233|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p233_073|p233|It starts with the script.
p233_259|p233|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p233_265|p233|It is not just about pay.
p233_271|p233|It looks as though he will be right.
p233_270|p233|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p233_264|p233|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p233_258|p233|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p233_072|p233|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p233_066|p233|He has not been dropped.
p233_099|p233|That is the fact of the matter.
p233_106|p233|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p233_112|p233|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p233_304|p233|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p233_310|p233|This is the culture change in medicine.
p233_338|p233|Nobody else was with me.
p258_120|p258|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p258_336|p258|They haven't got a hope.
p258_322|p258|He said she was mad.
p258_242|p258|It is hard won.
p258_256|p258|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p258_281|p258|He has a wealth of experience.
p258_295|p258|A new school will be built.
p258_068|p258|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p258_040|p258|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p258_054|p258|It's that kind of place.
p258_083|p258|Today I couldn't run on it.
p258_097|p258|It is a good lifestyle.
p258_096|p258|Oil embargo endorsed.
p258_082|p258|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p258_055|p258|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p258_041|p258|The judge said.
p258_069|p258|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p258_294|p258|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p258_280|p258|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p258_257|p258|They are interior designers and architects.
p258_243|p258|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p258_323|p258|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p258_337|p258|He did a good job.
p258_121|p258|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p258_135|p258|I am totally devoted to this job.
p258_123|p258|She does not want to speak.
p258_137|p258|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p258_309|p258|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p258_321|p258|Referees are easy targets.
p258_335|p258|There was no option.
p258_269|p258|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p258_255|p258|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p258_241|p258|They are all bright and different.
p258_296|p258|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p258_282|p258|It's so awful.
p258_057|p258|He was popular.
p258_043|p258|It's a blessing.
p258_094|p258|But it was a pleasure.
p258_080|p258|We have other options.
p258_081|p258|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p258_095|p258|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p258_042|p258|We need to chat.
p258_056|p258|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p258_283|p258|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p258_297|p258|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p258_240|p258|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p258_254|p258|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p258_268|p258|That's the only thing I will say.
p258_334|p258|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p258_320|p258|My body is clearly capable.
p258_308|p258|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p258_136|p258|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p258_122|p258|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p258_126|p258|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p258_132|p258|They made such decisions in London.
p258_324|p258|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p258_330|p258|Off with their heads.
p258_318|p258|It should be equal.
p258_250|p258|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p258_244|p258|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p258_278|p258|It's a way of life.
p258_293|p258|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p258_287|p258|The death toll included five children.
p258_052|p258|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p258_046|p258|He looks like an Afghan.
p258_091|p258|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p258_085|p258|It is a simple equation.
p258_084|p258|They are different types.
p258_090|p258|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p258_047|p258|It is the whole package.
p258_053|p258|That is very hard, alone.
p258_286|p258|This is a national crisis.
p258_292|p258|These figures are truly awful.
p258_279|p258|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p258_245|p258|You can feel at home in China.
p258_251|p258|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p258_319|p258|The problems began a long time ago.
p258_331|p258|I am so upset.
p258_325|p258|However, the groups denied the claims.
p258_133|p258|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p258_127|p258|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p258_131|p258|It plans to return to this field.
p258_125|p258|So the European elections are extremely important.
p258_119|p258|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p258_333|p258|Robert is a special talent.
p258_327|p258|I came into this world with nothing.
p258_247|p258|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p258_253|p258|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p258_284|p258|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p258_290|p258|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p258_045|p258|She looked so young.
p258_051|p258|We have not given up hope.
p258_079|p258|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p258_086|p258|Until you hit the big games.
p258_092|p258|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p258_093|p258|Journalists should make him.
p258_087|p258|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p258_078|p258|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p258_050|p258|That's the day job.
p258_044|p258|As she explains.
p258_291|p258|The results are sometimes contentious.
p258_285|p258|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p258_252|p258|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p258_246|p258|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p258_326|p258|There was some merit in that.
p258_332|p258|I'd like to take the plunge.
p258_118|p258|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p258_124|p258|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p258_130|p258|The role was perfect for Russell.
p258_157|p258|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p258_143|p258|You know the type.
p258_194|p258|It's the same old story.
p258_180|p258|They receive a high profile in the media.
p258_369|p258|I feel pretty good.
p258_355|p258|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p258_341|p258|Indeed, it was magical.
p258_396|p258|I suspect the latter.
p258_382|p258|It was a cry for help.
p258_209|p258|She should not be blamed.
p258_221|p258|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p258_235|p258|They should come forward.
p258_023|p258|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p258_037|p258|President Bush is at war.
p258_036|p258|It is not for any other purpose.
p258_022|p258|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p258_234|p258|We are in the hat.
p258_220|p258|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p258_208|p258|He is slightly confused.
p258_383|p258|Something is wrong.
p258_397|p258|These guys are looking for business.
p258_340|p258|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p258_354|p258|The salary changes are long overdue.
p258_368|p258|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p258_181|p258|We did everything by the book.
p258_195|p258|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p258_142|p258|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p258_156|p258|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p258_168|p258|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p258_140|p258|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p258_154|p258|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p258_183|p258|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p258_197|p258|Ferguson should take note.
p258_342|p258|I've got no secret.
p258_356|p258|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p258_381|p258|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p258_395|p258|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p258_236|p258|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p258_222|p258|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p258_008|p258|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p258_034|p258|I'd like to continue that record.
p258_020|p258|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p258_021|p258|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p258_035|p258|It was clear.
p258_009|p258|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p258_223|p258|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p258_237|p258|It's quite nice.
p258_394|p258|This year I understood.
p258_380|p258|Colour was at the core of his life.
p258_357|p258|It was very formal.
p258_343|p258|There's no place to hide.
p258_196|p258|Is that success?
p258_182|p258|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p258_155|p258|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p258_141|p258|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p258_169|p258|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p258_145|p258|The FBI could become involved.
p258_151|p258|Was this element always there?
p258_179|p258|Four policemen were wounded.
p258_186|p258|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p258_192|p258|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p258_347|p258|The composer will conduct.
p258_353|p258|I saw some good things.
p258_409|p258|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p258_384|p258|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p258_390|p258|YOU thought it was a headache.
p258_233|p258|They had no children.
p258_227|p258|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p258_031|p258|Because we do not need it.
p258_025|p258|Johnson was pretty low.
p258_019|p258|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p258_018|p258|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p258_024|p258|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p258_030|p258|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p258_226|p258|What was the main difference?
p258_232|p258|They tried to give her advice.
p258_391|p258|There is a solution, she believes.
p258_385|p258|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p258_408|p258|He scored a touchdown.
p258_352|p258|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p258_346|p258|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p258_193|p258|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p258_187|p258|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p258_178|p258|They will run a mile.
p258_150|p258|Neither side can win this war.
p258_144|p258|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p258_152|p258|These days are long gone.
p258_146|p258|The weather forecast isn't good.
p258_191|p258|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p258_185|p258|It is a terrible loss.
p258_350|p258|It is long gone.
p258_344|p258|Tiger is the exception.
p258_378|p258|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p258_393|p258|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p258_387|p258|That's the name of the game, though.
p258_224|p258|It's so special.
p258_230|p258|My wife and family are the support system.
p258_218|p258|I might come back.
p258_026|p258|It's nice to hear.
p258_032|p258|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p258_033|p258|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p258_027|p258|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p258_219|p258|His death was a tragic accident.
p258_231|p258|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p258_225|p258|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p258_386|p258|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p258_392|p258|However, it's good to turn the page.
p258_379|p258|Not because they want to sing about something.
p258_345|p258|Nobody else was with me.
p258_351|p258|Eight months later, he was dead.
p258_184|p258|We want to help them through it.
p258_190|p258|I grew up listening to these people.
p258_147|p258|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p258_153|p258|I've put my own money into this project.
p258_176|p258|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p258_162|p258|I lost my head.
p258_189|p258|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p258_348|p258|His contract was then not renewed.
p258_412|p258|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p258_374|p258|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p258_360|p258|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p258_406|p258|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p258_228|p258|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p258_200|p258|A deadline is still essential.
p258_214|p258|It's not ideal.
p258_002|p258|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p258_016|p258|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p258_017|p258|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p258_003|p258|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p258_215|p258|We want to keep the pound.
p258_201|p258|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p258_229|p258|They are the innocent victims.
p258_361|p258|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p258_407|p258|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p258_413|p258|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p258_375|p258|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p258_349|p258|I got a yellow card.
p258_188|p258|If the director is with you.
p258_163|p258|It is not too late to get on board.
p258_177|p258|I've been there.
p258_149|p258|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p258_161|p258|It's that sort of night.
p258_175|p258|I drove the ball well.
p258_405|p258|They are not left wing.
p258_363|p258|That would help.
p258_377|p258|Well, the big day has arrived.
p258_411|p258|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p258_388|p258|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p258_217|p258|He seemed to lose his focus.
p258_203|p258|It's a mixture of everything.
p258_029|p258|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p258_015|p258|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p258_001|p258|Please call Stella.  
p258_014|p258|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p258_028|p258|They should be so lucky.
p258_202|p258|It was worth a photograph.
p258_216|p258|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p258_389|p258|I was so nervous.
p258_376|p258|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p258_410|p258|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p258_404|p258|Then , he laughs.
p258_362|p258|We will be homeless.
p258_174|p258|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p258_160|p258|We try to keep it right.
p258_148|p258|My Dad is a hero.
p258_164|p258|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p258_170|p258|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p258_158|p258|We have to move forward.
p258_366|p258|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p258_400|p258|The car was just there.
p258_414|p258|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p258_372|p258|I thought he was my friend.
p258_399|p258|It was a breathtaking moment.
p258_212|p258|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p258_206|p258|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p258_010|p258|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p258_004|p258|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p258_038|p258|I was scared.
p258_039|p258|It will come all right.
p258_005|p258|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p258_011|p258|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p258_207|p258|Feel the heat?
p258_213|p258|His third goal was superb.
p258_398|p258|He is on the wrong side.
p258_373|p258|He could face a jail sentence.
p258_367|p258|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p258_401|p258|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p258_159|p258|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p258_171|p258|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p258_165|p258|That will do for me.
p258_173|p258|It should be easy.
p258_167|p258|I always felt they played for me.
p258_198|p258|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p258_371|p258|He could make it.
p258_403|p258|My house was shaking at the time.
p258_365|p258|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p258_359|p258|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p258_205|p258|We have an election in eight days.
p258_211|p258|It had all been arranged.
p258_239|p258|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p258_007|p258|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p258_013|p258|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p258_012|p258|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p258_006|p258|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p258_238|p258|Hospitals are for the ill.
p258_210|p258|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p258_204|p258|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p258_358|p258|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p258_402|p258|It is full-scale.
p258_364|p258|It was fit for royalty.
p258_370|p258|I am a star.
p258_199|p258|But she might be.
p258_166|p258|They thought they had found a home.
p258_172|p258|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p258_129|p258|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p258_115|p258|Who would have?
p258_101|p258|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p258_317|p258|Kids are terrible.
p258_303|p258|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p258_263|p258|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p258_277|p258|They were all in a stable condition last night.
p258_288|p258|He was obviously very genuine.
p258_049|p258|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p258_061|p258|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p258_075|p258|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p258_074|p258|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p258_060|p258|Try to save us.
p258_048|p258|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p258_289|p258|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p258_276|p258|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p258_262|p258|They must play for each other.
p258_302|p258|One was a lawyer.
p258_316|p258|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p258_100|p258|It's not perfect.
p258_114|p258|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p258_128|p258|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p258_102|p258|She has been shot.
p258_116|p258|It is a delight on every level.
p258_328|p258|It is a strong case.
p258_300|p258|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p258_314|p258|Scotland were beaten again.
p258_248|p258|I was shocked.
p258_274|p258|It is the same in Sweden.
p258_260|p258|I was in jail for five years.
p258_076|p258|I first met him last summer.
p258_062|p258|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p258_089|p258|She's got to say something.
p258_088|p258|There was no rescue.
p258_063|p258|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p258_077|p258|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p258_261|p258|I am very angry.
p258_275|p258|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p258_249|p258|I should think so, too.
p258_315|p258|They were fantastic.
p258_301|p258|Nothing is safe.
p258_329|p258|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p258_117|p258|You can spend money on housing.
p258_103|p258|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p258_107|p258|It is so sad.
p258_113|p258|I joined a group.
p258_305|p258|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p258_311|p258|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p258_339|p258|It was so new, so exciting.
p258_271|p258|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p258_265|p258|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p258_259|p258|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p258_073|p258|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p258_067|p258|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p258_098|p258|Before the game we went for a pint.
p258_099|p258|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p258_066|p258|The price cuts are really exciting.
p258_072|p258|This is the way things should be handled.
p258_258|p258|Chelsea was a great club.
p258_264|p258|It is also very valuable.
p258_270|p258|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p258_338|p258|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p258_310|p258|It's certainly different.
p258_304|p258|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p258_112|p258|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p258_106|p258|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p258_110|p258|This film will be totally awesome.
p258_104|p258|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p258_138|p258|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p258_312|p258|He will go a long way.
p258_306|p258|This is a war over our home.
p258_266|p258|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
p258_272|p258|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p258_299|p258|Graeme was prepared.
p258_064|p258|That was the easy election.
p258_070|p258|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p258_058|p258|It should be devolved.
p258_059|p258|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p258_071|p258|He got the same story.
p258_065|p258|It's all I can do.
p258_298|p258|The home was now under new management.
p258_273|p258|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p258_267|p258|I saw one body.
p258_307|p258|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p258_313|p258|We want to play at the worlds.
p258_139|p258|Is that Titanic?
p258_105|p258|We do not expect any surplus.
p258_111|p258|Maybe this battle has been.
p293_295|p293|Construction is due to begin in February.
p293_281|p293|I was living with my mum.
p293_054|p293|General, You didn't get a modified.
p293_040|p293|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p293_068|p293|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p293_097|p293|It has been hijacked.
p293_083|p293|However, my position remains the same.
p293_120|p293|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p293_134|p293|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p293_108|p293|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p293_322|p293|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p293_336|p293|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p293_337|p293|A whole range of factors are involved.
p293_323|p293|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p293_109|p293|The objective was achieved.
p293_135|p293|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p293_121|p293|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p293_082|p293|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p293_096|p293|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p293_069|p293|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p293_041|p293|I would just like someone to confess.
p293_055|p293|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p293_280|p293|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p293_294|p293|They never gave up hope.
p293_243|p293|How can they engage with the work?
p293_257|p293|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p293_241|p293|So what's wrong with Scotland?
p293_255|p293|In short, the club was broke.
p293_269|p293|It's part of your life.
p293_282|p293|We very much regret that it has occurred.
p293_296|p293|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p293_043|p293|We can be proud of our achievements.
p293_057|p293|This is far too high.
p293_080|p293|Sometimes they come off.
p293_094|p293|We've been overwhelmed by the response.
p293_137|p293|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p293_123|p293|Eriksson would have approved.
p293_335|p293|They had asked not to be named.
p293_321|p293|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p293_309|p293|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p293_308|p293|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p293_320|p293|Eleven events are required.
p293_334|p293|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p293_122|p293|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p293_136|p293|That is why we are here.
p293_095|p293|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p293_081|p293|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p293_056|p293|That is our unfinished business.
p293_042|p293|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p293_297|p293|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p293_283|p293|The whole process was so different.
p293_268|p293|Our children are our future.
p293_254|p293|They may differ on other issues.
p293_240|p293|I have been here for only three months.
p293_278|p293|This avalanche is just beginning.
p293_244|p293|It gave me something to focus on.
p293_250|p293|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p293_287|p293|They certainly do not socialise.
p293_293|p293|If so, we want to hear from them.
p293_046|p293|Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
p293_052|p293|It is a large number.
p293_085|p293|There are plenty examples.
p293_091|p293|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p293_132|p293|The firm was down and almost out.
p293_126|p293|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p293_318|p293|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p293_330|p293|He's very young but he is growing up.
p293_324|p293|I bought a car at auction.
p293_325|p293|You've gotten all the facts.
p293_331|p293|He is in charge on the pitch.
p293_319|p293|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p293_127|p293|The Taliban response was swift.
p293_133|p293|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p293_090|p293|Will he be given time?
p293_084|p293|However, it's good to turn the page.
p293_053|p293|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p293_047|p293|That was the theory, anyway.
p293_292|p293|We told them in June.
p293_286|p293|I don't know why she is not here.
p293_251|p293|Also, he was flawed.
p293_245|p293|We live by the rule of law.
p293_279|p293|That, however, is only part of their story.
p293_253|p293|I just could not cope.
p293_247|p293|She is fulfilled by it.
p293_290|p293|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p293_284|p293|The BBC was a disgrace.
p293_079|p293|All the people thought that we would die.
p293_051|p293|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293_045|p293|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p293_092|p293|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p293_086|p293|Self control is just one instalment.
p293_119|p293|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p293_125|p293|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
p293_131|p293|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
p293_327|p293|Life is too short.
p293_333|p293|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p293_332|p293|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p293_326|p293|It possibly depends on the position.
p293_130|p293|They have their own interests and techniques.
p293_124|p293|You ask the question.
p293_118|p293|These are long-term investments.
p293_087|p293|It's an hour of the same response.
p293_093|p293|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p293_044|p293|Clark is back on top form.
p293_050|p293|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p293_078|p293|I can live with just the one.
p293_285|p293|They feel it belongs to them.
p293_291|p293|He had played well in that central role.
p293_246|p293|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p293_252|p293|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p293_235|p293|There is a great carry over value.
p293_221|p293|It will take some time to establish.
p293_209|p293|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
p293_037|p293|I have got to adopt the same approach.
p293_023|p293|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p293_143|p293|The proposals were never taken seriously.
p293_157|p293|Horses have some sense.
p293_180|p293|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p293_194|p293|A final decision is expected by Friday.
p293_341|p293|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p293_355|p293|But it can happen for Tiger.
p293_369|p293|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p293_382|p293|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p293_396|p293|I should never have come over to Fife.
p293_397|p293|What kind of person is he?
p293_383|p293|The penalty was the turning point.
p293_368|p293|The men are safe and unharmed.
p293_354|p293|Failure is a curious concept.
p293_340|p293|I have great sympathy with these people.
p293_195|p293|We will do so again.
p293_181|p293|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p293_156|p293|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p293_142|p293|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p293_022|p293|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p293_036|p293|There is a growing anger among the group.
p293_208|p293|His conclusion is upbeat.
p293_220|p293|Who would be in that desert?
p293_234|p293|It's a way of making a mark.
p293_222|p293|Sadly the jury were not convinced.
p293_236|p293|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p293_020|p293|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p293_034|p293|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p293_008|p293|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p293_154|p293|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p293_140|p293|I've been very nervous.
p293_168|p293|So, easy does it.
p293_197|p293|I'm a bit annoyed.
p293_183|p293|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p293_356|p293|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p293_342|p293|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p293_395|p293|This is a completely new experience for me.
p293_381|p293|When he took over it really took off.
p293_380|p293|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p293_394|p293|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p293_343|p293|It raises a serious question mark.
p293_357|p293|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p293_182|p293|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p293_196|p293|We will only move forward.
p293_169|p293|I just want to enjoy myself.
p293_141|p293|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
p293_155|p293|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p293_009|p293|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p293_035|p293|There is a lot of heroin about.
p293_021|p293|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p293_237|p293|That was my own personal decision.
p293_223|p293|We never got off the bus.
p293_227|p293|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p293_233|p293|They had four children together.
p293_019|p293|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p293_025|p293|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p293_179|p293|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p293_151|p293|Our policy is clear.
p293_145|p293|The same goes for McKenna.
p293_192|p293|But he is something special, is he not?
p293_186|p293|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
p293_347|p293|The feeling is awesome.
p293_390|p293|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p293_384|p293|I have chosen to do this research.
p293_385|p293|It was even worse than at home.
p293_391|p293|I do not believe they are.
p293_346|p293|The attitude and commitment was decent.
p293_352|p293|Barry will be able to handle this.
p293_187|p293|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p293_193|p293|This is simply unjust.
p293_144|p293|The Treasury denied the claims.
p293_150|p293|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p293_178|p293|This gives us a lot of practice.
p293_030|p293|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p293_024|p293|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p293_018|p293|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p293_232|p293|Three others were wounded.
p293_226|p293|They have to come up with a solution.
p293_218|p293|The salary changes are long overdue.
p293_230|p293|We had no idea that this letter existed.
p293_224|p293|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p293_032|p293|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p293_026|p293|Theatre is not a museum.
p293_146|p293|Perhaps it should stay there.
p293_152|p293|I think we have a very strong case.
p293_185|p293|This is the stuff of live music.
p293_191|p293|So he was anxious to try something new.
p293_378|p293|It is three years at present.
p293_344|p293|He is dying from cancer.
p293_350|p293|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p293_387|p293|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p293_393|p293|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p293_392|p293|The aircraft was totally destroyed.
p293_386|p293|Michael's putting on a brave face.
p293_351|p293|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p293_345|p293|The package has been properly costed.
p293_379|p293|My husband was fighting for his life.
p293_190|p293|The fire was falling from the sky.
p293_184|p293|It was his job to check.
p293_153|p293|Who would be out there, singing?
p293_147|p293|You can be sure we will have problems.
p293_027|p293|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p293_033|p293|Several others were absent.
p293_225|p293|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p293_231|p293|I think in three dimensions.
p293_219|p293|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p293_214|p293|The replacements made a big difference.
p293_200|p293|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p293_228|p293|These will be finally corrected by next week.
p293_016|p293|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p293_002|p293|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p293_162|p293|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p293_176|p293|It has made me feel good.
p293_189|p293|It's a huge amount.
p293_360|p293|All these things have an impact.
p293_374|p293|I don't think the referees are against us.
p293_348|p293|He quit in October.
p293_349|p293|The family also declined to discuss the case.
p293_375|p293|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p293_361|p293|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p293_188|p293|But Allen is deadly serious.
p293_177|p293|It's been such a long haul.
p293_163|p293|Politics is a tough game.
p293_003|p293|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p293_229|p293|They will form a tribute.
p293_201|p293|What's the rush?
p293_215|p293|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p293_203|p293|Nothing is ruled out.
p293_217|p293|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p293_001|p293|Please call Stella.
p293_015|p293|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p293_029|p293|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p293_175|p293|When will this change?
p293_161|p293|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p293_149|p293|We had to take action to protect them.
p293_377|p293|This must be kept in total perspective.
p293_363|p293|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p293_388|p293|I am sure that this will happen again.
p293_389|p293|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p293_362|p293|I now know that from memory.
p293_376|p293|It is not a road of life.
p293_148|p293|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p293_160|p293|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p293_174|p293|The people here are quite reserved.
p293_028|p293|All my training is for Athens.
p293_014|p293|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p293_216|p293|A web site's planned for November.
p293_202|p293|It would also take time.
p293_206|p293|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p293_212|p293|I'm just gonna hit the shot.
p293_038|p293|Seven people were later detained by police.
p293_004|p293|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p293_010|p293|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p293_158|p293|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p293_170|p293|We are concerned that things should be safe.
p293_164|p293|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p293_372|p293|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p293_366|p293|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p293_400|p293|And this tournament will travel.
p293_399|p293|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p293_398|p293|Their bid was a very good one.
p293_367|p293|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
p293_373|p293|But it was to no avail.
p293_165|p293|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p293_171|p293|At this point we can only speculate.
p293_159|p293|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p293_011|p293|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p293_005|p293|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p293_039|p293|It's a sensible management decision.
p293_213|p293|He will not be carrying out any surgery.
p293_207|p293|He was also married with two children.
p293_239|p293|She returned home a few days later.
p293_211|p293|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p293_205|p293|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
p293_013|p293|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p293_007|p293|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p293_167|p293|It's unfair on her.
p293_173|p293|I am very shocked.
p293_198|p293|It ignores the future.
p293_359|p293|The initial reaction was disbelief.
p293_365|p293|He doesn't even know who he is.
p293_371|p293|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p293_370|p293|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p293_364|p293|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p293_358|p293|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p293_199|p293|I am just looking to God.
p293_172|p293|Family members are at her bedside.
p293_166|p293|It is physical but it is also good.
p293_006|p293|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p293_012|p293|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p293_204|p293|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p293_210|p293|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p293_238|p293|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p293_277|p293|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p293_263|p293|It feels like a privilege.
p293_288|p293|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p293_075|p293|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p293_061|p293|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293_049|p293|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p293_101|p293|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p293_115|p293|The door is open.
p293_129|p293|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p293_303|p293|There will be no disruption to teaching.
p293_317|p293|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p293_316|p293|Last year, however, was a different story.
p293_302|p293|It will vote with the US.
p293_128|p293|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p293_114|p293|You, the British people, are the boss.
p293_100|p293|You do have a way out.
p293_048|p293|Ferguson must take the blame.
p293_060|p293|But the foundations have been laid.
p293_074|p293|We've had our problems at the club.
p293_289|p293|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p293_262|p293|The Commons is too outdated.
p293_276|p293|I know you went back this morning.
p293_260|p293|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p293_274|p293|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p293_248|p293|But one shouldn't go by that.
p293_062|p293|So they will settle again.
p293_076|p293|More than half of the school collapsed.
p293_089|p293|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
p293_116|p293|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p293_102|p293|This is not a European Army.
p293_314|p293|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p293_300|p293|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p293_328|p293|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p293_329|p293|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p293_301|p293|But they will not be compelled to join.
p293_315|p293|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p293_103|p293|These guys are looking for business.
p293_117|p293|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
p293_088|p293|I could not believe what they were saying.
p293_077|p293|We also hope to meet the men.
p293_063|p293|He had other things on his mind.
p293_249|p293|Nobody has been put on trial.
p293_275|p293|Life becomes a song.
p293_261|p293|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p293_259|p293|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p293_265|p293|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p293_271|p293|I was furious about it.
p293_067|p293|A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
p293_073|p293|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p293_098|p293|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p293_113|p293|The cost of war is more than that.
p293_107|p293|They will now have to justify their position.
p293_339|p293|They would love to do more films.
p293_311|p293|Four had been brought down.
p293_305|p293|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p293_304|p293|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p293_310|p293|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p293_338|p293|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p293_106|p293|It was different in the endurance events.
p293_112|p293|There is no musical background in his family.
p293_099|p293|They must put them back.
p293_072|p293|You see, my back has gone.
p293_066|p293|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p293_270|p293|The defender made an impressive debut.
p293_264|p293|We have got a full house tonight.
p293_258|p293|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p293_272|p293|They were not doing it too well, either.
p293_266|p293|He will be advised by me.
p293_058|p293|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p293_070|p293|I was shaking on the blocks.
p293_064|p293|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p293_138|p293|Somehow they got out.
p293_104|p293|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p293_110|p293|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p293_306|p293|Again the verdict was not proven.
p293_312|p293|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
p293_313|p293|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p293_307|p293|We've just got to work a bit better.
p293_111|p293|Look at his last couple of records.
p293_105|p293|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p293_139|p293|The house was so well alight.
p293_065|p293|Let us hope so.
p293_071|p293|So the challenge is against ourselves.
p293_059|p293|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p293_298|p293|The red card was okay.
p293_267|p293|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
p293_273|p293|It is typical of me.
p267_294|p267|I felt like I was a child.
p267_280|p267|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p267_055|p267|So I liked the challenge.
p267_041|p267|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p267_069|p267|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p267_096|p267|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p267_082|p267|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p267_121|p267|Tiger is not the norm.
p267_135|p267|So I got a blood test.
p267_109|p267|We have a training class.
p267_323|p267|After some discussion they did.
p267_337|p267|There was no time scale.
p267_336|p267|They are now out in the cold.
p267_322|p267|We want to play at the worlds.
p267_108|p267|That admission is not surprising.
p267_134|p267|I am just trying to do my job.
p267_120|p267|You've got to be vigilant.
p267_083|p267|There was no way back for United after that.
p267_097|p267|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p267_068|p267|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p267_040|p267|It is difficult for Ali.
p267_054|p267|Four other charges were dropped.
p267_281|p267|He was also married with two children.
p267_295|p267|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p267_242|p267|It is the loss of my name.
p267_256|p267|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p267_240|p267|You will have seen the adverts.
p267_254|p267|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p267_268|p267|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p267_283|p267|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p267_297|p267|The attacker died in the crash.
p267_042|p267|He is too weak to move.
p267_056|p267|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p267_081|p267|They lived for their children.
p267_095|p267|That means an extra two years.
p267_136|p267|It has become a way of life.
p267_122|p267|My conscience is not clear.
p267_334|p267|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p267_320|p267|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p267_308|p267|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p267_309|p267|Cast Away now on general release.
p267_321|p267|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p267_335|p267|But the New Year was special.
p267_123|p267|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p267_137|p267|I was caught out a little bit.
p267_094|p267|It's not a lack of effort.
p267_080|p267|It's so hard to shift.
p267_057|p267|That way I won't have to do anything.
p267_043|p267|Everything else is a bonus.
p267_296|p267|He wants to talk a lot.
p267_282|p267|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p267_269|p267|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p267_255|p267|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p267_279|p267|He has run a hell of a race.
p267_245|p267|I am still waiting for a reply.
p267_251|p267|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p267_286|p267|And they were being paid?
p267_292|p267|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p267_047|p267|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p267_053|p267|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p267_084|p267|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p267_090|p267|Before the game we went for a pint.
p267_133|p267|It was a piece of art.
p267_127|p267|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p267_319|p267|I would do away with the dress code.
p267_331|p267|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p267_325|p267|It is all credit to them today.
p267_330|p267|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p267_318|p267|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p267_126|p267|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p267_132|p267|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p267_091|p267|Our house was very small.
p267_085|p267|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p267_052|p267|I must take a seat.
p267_046|p267|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p267_293|p267|We have a plan in place.
p267_287|p267|was everything done to save people?
p267_250|p267|It seems a waste of talents.
p267_244|p267|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p267_278|p267|It is set in Paris.
p267_252|p267|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p267_246|p267|It is a court case.
p267_291|p267|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p267_285|p267|That goes back a long way.
p267_078|p267|He can win every week.
p267_050|p267|It is a different animal.
p267_044|p267|This is the interesting part.
p267_093|p267|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p267_087|p267|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p267_118|p267|We did what we had to do.
p267_124|p267|It would make a lot of sense.
p267_130|p267|That group reported just before Christmas.
p267_326|p267|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p267_332|p267|The problems began a long time ago.
p267_333|p267|It makes a compelling display.
p267_327|p267|You are looking at him.
p267_131|p267|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p267_125|p267|They could use a boost.
p267_119|p267|I am the Son of Sam.
p267_086|p267|They need to find a form of words.
p267_092|p267|They were a lovely couple.
p267_045|p267|I guess I was lucky, though.
p267_051|p267|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p267_079|p267|By then, he was walking on water.
p267_284|p267|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p267_290|p267|Stephen will get his first cap.
p267_247|p267|He has been a success this year.
p267_253|p267|His is a global perspective.
p267_234|p267|And he goes with it.
p267_220|p267|Because they didn't want to know.
p267_208|p267|From there, they can go anywhere.
p267_036|p267|A week is a long time in politics.
p267_022|p267|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p267_142|p267|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p267_156|p267|Seven people were later detained by police.
p267_181|p267|It is a common problem.
p267_195|p267|I suggest a new plan.
p267_340|p267|Do you think we are a top nation?
p267_354|p267|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p267_368|p267|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p267_383|p267|They have not done so this season so far.
p267_397|p267|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p267_396|p267|I watch the other visitors.
p267_382|p267|A review is under way.
p267_369|p267|There is no deal as yet.
p267_355|p267|He did a good job.
p267_341|p267|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p267_194|p267|I came home by ambulance.
p267_180|p267|They need to look after themselves.
p267_157|p267|I would probably have to agree with him.
p267_143|p267|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p267_023|p267|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p267_037|p267|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p267_209|p267|I had relied on him.
p267_221|p267|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p267_235|p267|They tried to give her advice.
p267_223|p267|What do we want to do that for?
p267_237|p267|She died in middle age.
p267_021|p267|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p267_035|p267|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p267_009|p267|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p267_155|p267|We came across the first set of bodies.
p267_141|p267|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p267_169|p267|It is premature to speculate on the impact.
p267_196|p267|The conference is the first test.
p267_182|p267|A team is a team.
p267_357|p267|It is a stroke of genius.
p267_343|p267|A report is expected next month.
p267_419|p267|It needs to be volatile.
p267_394|p267|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p267_380|p267|We operate as a Scottish company.
p267_381|p267|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p267_395|p267|We shall not be moved.
p267_418|p267|Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
p267_342|p267|It is a strong case.
p267_356|p267|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p267_183|p267|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p267_197|p267|Tommy is not a problem.
p267_168|p267|I always felt they played for me.
p267_140|p267|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p267_154|p267|As, indeed, they would be.
p267_008|p267|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p267_034|p267|I became a widow overnight.
p267_020|p267|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p267_236|p267|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p267_222|p267|You have to do your research.
p267_226|p267|What are you not good at?
p267_232|p267|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p267_018|p267|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p267_024|p267|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p267_030|p267|We will look into it.
p267_178|p267|The referee had a good game.
p267_150|p267|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p267_144|p267|It was by the numbers.
p267_193|p267|If I was a woman.
p267_187|p267|People will ask about us.
p267_408|p267|We will stand for the nation.
p267_352|p267|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p267_346|p267|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p267_420|p267|I've got my own ideas.
p267_391|p267|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p267_385|p267|Safety was also an issue.
p267_384|p267|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p267_390|p267|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p267_347|p267|He was then replaced by Ross.
p267_421|p267|Nobody should believe this story.
p267_353|p267|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p267_409|p267|I'm pleased about one thing.
p267_186|p267|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p267_192|p267|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p267_145|p267|We will turn the corner.
p267_151|p267|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p267_179|p267|The European Union is a case in point.
p267_031|p267|This is a central issue.
p267_025|p267|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p267_019|p267|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p267_233|p267|My wife and family are the support system.
p267_227|p267|William Hague delighted his party.
p267_219|p267|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p267_231|p267|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p267_225|p267|how do you get it back?
p267_033|p267|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p267_027|p267|There is no reason at all.
p267_147|p267|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p267_153|p267|We are still getting over it.
p267_184|p267|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p267_190|p267|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p267_379|p267|In fact, he was great today.
p267_345|p267|They were the acts of men.
p267_351|p267|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p267_386|p267|We have made no final decisions.
p267_392|p267|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p267_393|p267|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p267_387|p267|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p267_350|p267|I have a moral dilemma.
p267_344|p267|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p267_378|p267|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p267_191|p267|Final proposals will be published in February.
p267_185|p267|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p267_152|p267|That is not too bad.
p267_146|p267|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p267_026|p267|He may not need to force that message.
p267_032|p267|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p267_224|p267|Does the name matter?
p267_230|p267|The boy is no longer with us.
p267_218|p267|It was a crazy day.
p267_215|p267|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p267_201|p267|A bit of match fitness is required.
p267_229|p267|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p267_017|p267|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p267_003|p267|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p267_163|p267|Are you from the rugby?
p267_177|p267|I have spoken to head office.
p267_188|p267|I had come back from London.
p267_361|p267|They have created a business.
p267_407|p267|None of the agencies was able to help.
p267_413|p267|Such an attack is bizarre.
p267_375|p267|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p267_349|p267|He is not very big, either.
p267_348|p267|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p267_412|p267|My aim is a top six finish.
p267_374|p267|The marshall at the turn was great.
p267_360|p267|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p267_406|p267|I thought he was an animal.
p267_189|p267|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p267_176|p267|He played it like a veteran.
p267_162|p267|And does it?
p267_002|p267|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p267_016|p267|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p267_228|p267|You could feel the heat.
p267_200|p267|I won't make an official complaint.
p267_214|p267|They're going to open in early summer.
p267_202|p267|It is an impressive record.
p267_216|p267|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p267_014|p267|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p267_028|p267|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p267_174|p267|It is not a threat.
p267_160|p267|Nobody did in those days.
p267_148|p267|There was a definite prejudice.
p267_376|p267|The seller was not revealed.
p267_410|p267|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p267_404|p267|You thought it was a headache.
p267_362|p267|I got a yellow card.
p267_389|p267|It was a funny game.
p267_388|p267|The results will take second place.
p267_405|p267|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p267_363|p267|I am considered a teenager.
p267_377|p267|People are on the alert.
p267_411|p267|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p267_149|p267|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p267_161|p267|So what is the campaign about?
p267_175|p267|I would not count on it.
p267_029|p267|Because we do not need it.
p267_015|p267|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p267_001|p267|Please call Stella.  
p267_217|p267|It is good for our team.
p267_203|p267|There is no quick fix.
p267_207|p267|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p267_213|p267|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p267_039|p267|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p267_005|p267|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p267_011|p267|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p267_159|p267|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p267_171|p267|It is a body blow.
p267_165|p267|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p267_415|p267|He is on the wrong side.
p267_373|p267|They are used to the big stage.
p267_367|p267|She is now on the back benches.
p267_401|p267|What are they for?
p267_398|p267|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p267_399|p267|That's all I can say.
p267_366|p267|It's only a matter of scale.
p267_400|p267|Are they free?
p267_414|p267|These guys are looking for business.
p267_372|p267|The pair are very much in love.
p267_164|p267|Had I heard?
p267_170|p267|They made such decisions in London.
p267_158|p267|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p267_010|p267|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p267_004|p267|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p267_038|p267|This represents a tough game for us.
p267_212|p267|My life is in the ballet.
p267_206|p267|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p267_238|p267|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p267_210|p267|The course has helped a lot.
p267_204|p267|Abbey National is an option.
p267_012|p267|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p267_006|p267|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p267_166|p267|It's nice to be nice.
p267_172|p267|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p267_199|p267|He had suffered a heart attack.
p267_358|p267|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p267_402|p267|Is there a waiting list?
p267_364|p267|There may be reasons for it.
p267_370|p267|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p267_416|p267|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p267_371|p267|to have products for their needs.
p267_417|p267|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p267_403|p267|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p267_365|p267|This is a major championship.
p267_359|p267|We live on an island.
p267_198|p267|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p267_173|p267|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p267_167|p267|The people are the hero.
p267_007|p267|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p267_013|p267|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p267_205|p267|It has been like that all year for me.
p267_211|p267|I'm just a regular person.
p267_239|p267|Those overseas offices were great.
p267_276|p267|A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
p267_262|p267|The capital costs are modest.
p267_289|p267|Do I think about them often?
p267_074|p267|That is bound to happen.
p267_060|p267|We need to increase the membership.
p267_048|p267|There was no safety net.
p267_100|p267|They will notice a difference.
p267_114|p267|Why do it otherwise?
p267_128|p267|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
p267_302|p267|I am a retailer by nature.
p267_316|p267|He has left the company.
p267_317|p267|I am not concerned with protection of the public.
p267_303|p267|Well, he can do it.
p267_129|p267|He was seen as the enemy.
p267_115|p267|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p267_049|p267|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p267_061|p267|He was at home with his pals.
p267_075|p267|He is in the queue.
p267_288|p267|What was the matter for concern?
p267_263|p267|It was the climax of the thing.
p267_277|p267|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p267_261|p267|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p267_275|p267|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p267_249|p267|He declined to give any details.
p267_063|p267|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p267_077|p267|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p267_088|p267|It's for that reason he should resign.
p267_117|p267|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p267_103|p267|He has done that with a great deal to spare.
p267_301|p267|That is the general feeling.
p267_329|p267|It's not an easy life.
p267_328|p267|This is a source of real concern for the area.
p267_300|p267|It's difficult to predict the future.
p267_314|p267|I will not be afraid.
p267_102|p267|Such actions are rarely popular.
p267_116|p267|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p267_089|p267|The rescue package is public money.
p267_076|p267|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p267_062|p267|They are in the euro.
p267_248|p267|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p267_274|p267|He will emerge as a world leader.
p267_260|p267|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p267_258|p267|They were back in full training yesterday.
p267_264|p267|I can't get a job.
p267_270|p267|It is also very valuable.
p267_066|p267|Do I have a favourite?
p267_072|p267|A government is a government is a government.
p267_099|p267|We need to handle it.
p267_112|p267|I was on a roll.
p267_106|p267|I was always a little behind.
p267_338|p267|Does that put pressure on us?
p267_310|p267|It is a road of death.
p267_304|p267|The weather forecast isn't good.
p267_305|p267|The judge was really nice.
p267_311|p267|We will make a statement tomorrow.
p267_339|p267|Did it work?
p267_107|p267|There were no grounds for his action.
p267_113|p267|What do we do?
p267_098|p267|Sport is good for you.
p267_073|p267|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p267_067|p267|There could be a way back.
p267_271|p267|It disappeared into the cup.
p267_265|p267|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p267_259|p267|No production contract is yet in sight.
p267_273|p267|Not many companies can say that these days.
p267_267|p267|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p267_298|p267|It is inherent in society.
p267_059|p267|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p267_071|p267|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p267_065|p267|So is that it, then?
p267_139|p267|It has to be an event.
p267_105|p267|She's got to say something.
p267_111|p267|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p267_307|p267|It is a potential danger.
p267_313|p267|You will never get a conviction.
p267_312|p267|There were no passengers on board.
p267_306|p267|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p267_110|p267|Well, you can have a tree.
p267_104|p267|Then again, we could have.
p267_138|p267|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p267_064|p267|How are you, sir?
p267_070|p267|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p267_058|p267|It's just the timing of the game.
p267_299|p267|He refused to name the survivors.
p267_266|p267|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p267_272|p267|The stage was set for a showdown.
p260_029|p260|They have no history.
p260_217|p260|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p260_203|p260|It had all been arranged.
p260_161|p260|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p260_175|p260|Everyone can be bought.
p260_149|p260|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p260_148|p260|The weather forecast isn't good.
p260_174|p260|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p260_160|p260|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p260_202|p260|I am delighted for Simon.
p260_216|p260|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p260_028|p260|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p260_014|p260|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p260_002|p260|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p260_016|p260|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p260_200|p260|There was an e-mail.
p260_214|p260|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p260_228|p260|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p260_348|p260|A great deal has been achieved.
p260_189|p260|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p260_176|p260|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p260_162|p260|They are not advertised.
p260_163|p260|Seven people were later detained by police.
p260_177|p260|I've been there.
p260_188|p260|I came home by ambulance.
p260_349|p260|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p260_229|p260|There is no excuse.
p260_215|p260|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p260_201|p260|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p260_017|p260|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p260_003|p260|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p260_007|p260|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p260_013|p260|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p260_239|p260|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p260_205|p260|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p260_211|p260|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p260_198|p260|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p260_173|p260|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p260_167|p260|Does that put pressure on us?
p260_166|p260|They will do their own thing.
p260_172|p260|It is not either national standards or local control.
p260_199|p260|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p260_210|p260|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p260_204|p260|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p260_238|p260|The scene is about this?
p260_012|p260|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p260_006|p260|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p260_038|p260|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p260_010|p260|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p260_004|p260|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p260_212|p260|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p260_206|p260|It's not ideal.
p260_158|p260|Was this element always there?
p260_164|p260|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p260_170|p260|As we worked.
p260_171|p260|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p260_165|p260|Again, we were lucky.
p260_159|p260|These days are long gone.
p260_207|p260|In each case they were a goal down.
p260_213|p260|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p260_005|p260|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p260_011|p260|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p260_039|p260|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p260_089|p260|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p260_076|p260|The party is up for it.
p260_062|p260|It's that kind of place.
p260_274|p260|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p260_260|p260|I am just trying to do my job.
p260_248|p260|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p260_300|p260|What has altered?
p260_314|p260|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p260_328|p260|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p260_102|p260|They make a selective perception process.
p260_116|p260|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p260_117|p260|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p260_103|p260|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p260_329|p260|We are in the end game.
p260_315|p260|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p260_301|p260|Nothing is safe.
p260_249|p260|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p260_261|p260|This is a question of Islam.
p260_275|p260|If not, he should go home.
p260_063|p260|They are real.
p260_077|p260|Even the one she loved.
p260_088|p260|It is a lifeline.
p260_061|p260|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p260_075|p260|Is there a new way forward?
p260_049|p260|Here's a clue.
p260_288|p260|We are not going to forget.
p260_263|p260|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p260_277|p260|We are a grandmother.
p260_317|p260|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p260_303|p260|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p260_115|p260|It is so sad.
p260_101|p260|They tried to deny it.
p260_129|p260|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p260_128|p260|No production was achieved.
p260_100|p260|May not have been at fault?
p260_114|p260|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p260_302|p260|One was a lawyer.
p260_316|p260|Special measures were needed.
p260_276|p260|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p260_262|p260|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p260_289|p260|No Briton has ever won.
p260_048|p260|Our people are ready.
p260_074|p260|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p260_060|p260|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p260_058|p260|There's a danger.
p260_064|p260|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p260_070|p260|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p260_299|p260|I was the sheep.
p260_266|p260|We're in shock.
p260_272|p260|She looked so young.
p260_312|p260|The letters are going out today.
p260_306|p260|I can live with it.
p260_138|p260|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p260_110|p260|It was a funny game.
p260_104|p260|That's all right then.
p260_105|p260|Oil embargo endorsed.
p260_111|p260|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p260_139|p260|I was awful.
p260_307|p260|Work has started.
p260_313|p260|We want to play at the worlds.
p260_273|p260|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p260_267|p260|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p260_298|p260|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p260_071|p260|He was at home with his pals.
p260_065|p260|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p260_059|p260|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p260_098|p260|It is a love affair.
p260_073|p260|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p260_067|p260|That was a gold medal for certain.
p260_259|p260|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p260_271|p260|They seem to get away with it.
p260_265|p260|The system can work.
p260_339|p260|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p260_305|p260|They are wrong.
p260_311|p260|The minister is the engineer.
p260_107|p260|She reflects a bit.
p260_113|p260|It was the eighties.
p260_112|p260|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p260_106|p260|Before the game we went for a pint.
p260_310|p260|You should be.
p260_304|p260|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p260_338|p260|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p260_264|p260|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p260_270|p260|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p260_258|p260|There's not much money in cycling.
p260_066|p260|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p260_072|p260|It was magic.
p260_099|p260|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p260_094|p260|It is annoying.
p260_080|p260|Who will pay for this?
p260_057|p260|What was the main difference?
p260_043|p260|We will push.
p260_296|p260|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p260_282|p260|He will address the nation this evening.
p260_255|p260|Is that a serious question?
p260_241|p260|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p260_269|p260|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p260_321|p260|We have got to get the points from this one.
p260_335|p260|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p260_309|p260|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p260_123|p260|There were no grounds for his action.
p260_137|p260|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p260_136|p260|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p260_122|p260|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p260_308|p260|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p260_334|p260|Relief was beyond belief.
p260_320|p260|Such actions are rarely popular.
p260_268|p260|It's a way of life.
p260_240|p260|It was a kind of contempt.
p260_254|p260|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p260_283|p260|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p260_297|p260|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p260_042|p260|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p260_056|p260|I expect a rapid response.
p260_081|p260|He had taken everything from me.
p260_095|p260|I love the Dome.
p260_083|p260|By then, he was walking on water.
p260_097|p260|I am extremely sad.
p260_040|p260|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p260_054|p260|Sadly, it can't.
p260_068|p260|We should have known.
p260_281|p260|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p260_295|p260|Who can predict?
p260_242|p260|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p260_256|p260|They must play for each other.
p260_336|p260|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p260_322|p260|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p260_134|p260|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p260_120|p260|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p260_108|p260|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p260_109|p260|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p260_121|p260|We enjoyed it today.
p260_135|p260|I don't know the full story.
p260_323|p260|Henman has been warned.
p260_337|p260|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p260_257|p260|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p260_243|p260|I should think so, too.
p260_294|p260|The goals will come.
p260_280|p260|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p260_069|p260|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p260_055|p260|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p260_041|p260|Dancing was her life.
p260_096|p260|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p260_082|p260|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p260_086|p260|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p260_092|p260|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p260_079|p260|Today she has been released.
p260_045|p260|Among them are many criminals.
p260_051|p260|I was inspired by two things.
p260_284|p260|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p260_290|p260|Painful, but only because it's true.
p260_247|p260|Is there on his hands?
p260_253|p260|We have to expand.
p260_333|p260|It is a job creation scheme.
p260_327|p260|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p260_119|p260|It is rubbish.
p260_131|p260|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p260_125|p260|She really suffered for her art.
p260_124|p260|I can't even get into the A team.
p260_130|p260|It plans to return to this field.
p260_118|p260|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p260_326|p260|The problems began a long time ago.
p260_332|p260|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p260_252|p260|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p260_246|p260|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p260_291|p260|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p260_285|p260|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p260_050|p260|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p260_044|p260|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p260_078|p260|People must remain vigilant.
p260_093|p260|Then came the crunch.
p260_087|p260|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p260_091|p260|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p260_085|p260|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p260_052|p260|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p260_046|p260|It is marvellous.
p260_293|p260|And it's a goodbye from him.
p260_287|p260|Bombing slaughter rejected
p260_278|p260|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p260_250|p260|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p260_244|p260|It was a hit.
p260_318|p260|The show is at an end.
p260_324|p260|I would love it.
p260_330|p260|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p260_126|p260|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p260_132|p260|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p260_133|p260|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p260_127|p260|The people will come.
p260_331|p260|There was no time scale.
p260_319|p260|Your father was a good man.
p260_245|p260|There's the mix.
p260_251|p260|Chelsea was a great club.
p260_279|p260|You feel very helpless.
p260_286|p260|This is a national crisis.
p260_292|p260|The songs are just so good.
p260_047|p260|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p260_053|p260|My fitness was very poor.
p260_084|p260|They lived for their children.
p260_090|p260|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p260_034|p260|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p260_020|p260|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p260_008|p260|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p260_236|p260|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p260_222|p260|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p260_342|p260|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p260_356|p260|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p260_183|p260|Our team is just so young.
p260_197|p260|It was worth a photograph.
p260_140|p260|The idea is simple.
p260_154|p260|My Dad is a hero.
p260_168|p260|One season, they might do well.
p260_169|p260|Is Saddam a threat?
p260_155|p260|He was asked to quit.
p260_141|p260|That group reported just before Christmas.
p260_196|p260|There was no safety net.
p260_182|p260|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p260_357|p260|I first met him last summer.
p260_343|p260|He has to learn.
p260_223|p260|My wife and family are the support system.
p260_237|p260|You can feel at home in China.
p260_009|p260|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p260_021|p260|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p260_035|p260|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p260_023|p260|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p260_037|p260|It's a fact.
p260_221|p260|But she was.
p260_235|p260|Our policy is clear.
p260_209|p260|I might come back.
p260_355|p260|We have big ideas.
p260_341|p260|He was the architect.
p260_194|p260|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p260_180|p260|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p260_157|p260|He can do no wrong.
p260_143|p260|It is not just about pay.
p260_142|p260|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p260_156|p260|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p260_181|p260|What has caused the demise of singing?
p260_195|p260|It's all about money, money, money.
p260_340|p260|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p260_354|p260|I HAVE a dream.
p260_208|p260|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p260_234|p260|The whole thing will be great.
p260_220|p260|The report is due out next month.
p260_036|p260|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p260_022|p260|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p260_026|p260|We will be homeless.
p260_032|p260|There's a story, too.
p260_218|p260|It's not before time.
p260_224|p260|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p260_230|p260|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p260_350|p260|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p260_344|p260|Two people were interviewed.
p260_191|p260|They are ready.
p260_185|p260|It is a farce.
p260_152|p260|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p260_146|p260|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p260_147|p260|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p260_153|p260|We are on a four-year mission.
p260_184|p260|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p260_190|p260|Is that success?
p260_345|p260|I've got no secret.
p260_351|p260|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p260_231|p260|But it's a subtle process.
p260_225|p260|We were awful.
p260_219|p260|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p260_033|p260|This is the window.
p260_027|p260|Is this accurate?
p260_019|p260|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p260_031|p260|I'd just like to play.
p260_025|p260|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p260_233|p260|The car was just there.
p260_227|p260|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p260_347|p260|I'm very lucky.
p260_353|p260|Eight months later, he was dead.
p260_186|p260|Peace was won.
p260_192|p260|I have a cold.
p260_179|p260|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p260_145|p260|So I got a blood test.
p260_151|p260|I was on a roll.
p260_150|p260|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p260_144|p260|Note the date.
p260_178|p260|Four policemen were wounded.
p260_193|p260|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p260_187|p260|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p260_352|p260|They should take their mobile phones.
p260_346|p260|This is a big advantage.
p260_226|p260|They tried to give her advice.
p260_232|p260|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p260_024|p260|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p260_030|p260|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p260_018|p260|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p294_216|p294|We're very, very excited.
p294_202|p294|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p294_389|p294|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p294_404|p294|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p294_362|p294|Europe is a bonus.
p294_376|p294|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p294_410|p294|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p294_160|p294|I am the Son of Sam.
p294_174|p294|These things can happen.
p294_148|p294|We are all very proud of her.
p294_149|p294|I'm sure that is not.
p294_175|p294|Family members are at her bedside.
p294_161|p294|There is no shortage of commitment.
p294_377|p294|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p294_411|p294|It raises the edge.
p294_405|p294|It's a tragedy for the area.
p294_363|p294|It is also used to buy coffins.
p294_388|p294|But what is?
p294_203|p294|We now have a moment of hope.
p294_217|p294|It's not a question of talking.
p294_029|p294|I was pregnant and very worried.
p294_001|p294|Please call Stella.
p294_015|p294|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p294_003|p294|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p294_017|p294|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p294_201|p294|All options are on the table.
p294_215|p294|They will form a tribute.
p294_229|p294|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p294_413|p294|It is a delight on every level.
p294_375|p294|We need to increase the membership.
p294_361|p294|People come to see the Highlands.
p294_407|p294|I don't think there's going to be one.
p294_349|p294|I'm not going to change from it.
p294_188|p294|This is simply unjust.
p294_177|p294|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
p294_163|p294|He deserves a second chance.
p294_162|p294|Such as it is.
p294_176|p294|You have to go to the edges.
p294_189|p294|The First Minister is an addict.
p294_348|p294|The result could be all down to turnout.
p294_360|p294|The trial continues today.
p294_406|p294|It was very well received.
p294_412|p294|It was not known to myself.
p294_374|p294|We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
p294_228|p294|I could not believe what they were saying.
p294_214|p294|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p294_200|p294|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p294_016|p294|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p294_002|p294|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p294_006|p294|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p294_012|p294|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p294_238|p294|They will do nothing for the local people.
p294_204|p294|They should not be blamed for it.
p294_210|p294|This came as no great surprise to anyone.
p294_358|p294|No decision on that was taken.
p294_370|p294|But who was driving it?
p294_416|p294|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p294_402|p294|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p294_364|p294|I've got to provide for my family.
p294_199|p294|That's been the case for a while.
p294_172|p294|Art is still a risky investment.
p294_166|p294|There's been a mistake.
p294_167|p294|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p294_173|p294|It was little else.
p294_198|p294|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p294_403|p294|We will deal with the refugees.
p294_365|p294|Such debate is pointless.
p294_371|p294|We recorded it at our own expense.
p294_417|p294|I saw it in a different way.
p294_359|p294|My fitness was very poor.
p294_211|p294|I love this job.
p294_205|p294|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
p294_239|p294|Do it for us now.
p294_013|p294|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p294_007|p294|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p294_039|p294|He got the same story.
p294_011|p294|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p294_005|p294|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p294_213|p294|We are very, very pleased with the response.
p294_207|p294|It will take some time to establish.
p294_398|p294|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
p294_367|p294|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p294_401|p294|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p294_415|p294|I don't entirely buy that.
p294_373|p294|Try to save us.
p294_159|p294|You've been working for four years.
p294_165|p294|There was no change in the strategy.
p294_171|p294|We have a genuine budget in place.
p294_170|p294|We have managed to get it under control.
p294_164|p294|He also admitted.
p294_158|p294|The Treasury denied the claims.
p294_414|p294|Would it really be good to shorten it?
p294_372|p294|But opponents were quick to criticise.
p294_366|p294|And it had two seats.
p294_400|p294|Of course, it doesn't all come off.
p294_399|p294|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p294_206|p294|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p294_212|p294|I have no secrets.
p294_004|p294|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p294_010|p294|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p294_038|p294|Their ambition is to go back.
p294_088|p294|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
p294_077|p294|It will not be a long campaign.
p294_063|p294|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p294_275|p294|We've been here before.
p294_261|p294|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p294_249|p294|But it was a pleasure.
p294_301|p294|Their bid was a very good one.
p294_315|p294|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p294_329|p294|Then it was into a series of classes.
p294_103|p294|It's a long process.
p294_117|p294|And she got it.
p294_116|p294|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p294_102|p294|It's too close to call.
p294_328|p294|There are so many unanswered questions.
p294_314|p294|It is three years at present.
p294_300|p294|There was no happiness.
p294_248|p294|They never gave up hope.
p294_260|p294|I haven't a clue.
p294_274|p294|It's as simple as that.
p294_062|p294|Debate is not just talk.
p294_076|p294|She now lives in London.
p294_089|p294|Seven British members of the club are missing.
p294_060|p294|I went with the mood.
p294_074|p294|This is the real thing now.
p294_048|p294|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294_289|p294|So it was sad.
p294_262|p294|I thought he was terrific.
p294_276|p294|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p294_316|p294|We all make mistakes.
p294_302|p294|Everything is so commercial.
p294_114|p294|The industry will try to get round it.
p294_100|p294|You should have let it write the cards.
p294_128|p294|I can't speak for him.
p294_129|p294|They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
p294_101|p294|It's annoying in a way.
p294_115|p294|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
p294_303|p294|And this tournament will travel.
p294_317|p294|It didn't put me off.
p294_277|p294|From there, it was a success story.
p294_263|p294|A statement is expected in April.
p294_288|p294|A great deal was achieved.
p294_049|p294|We've all done it!
p294_075|p294|Until they came to do it.
p294_061|p294|I think we'll just keep it.
p294_059|p294|We are only human.
p294_065|p294|People remember the Tories in office.
p294_071|p294|It took about five or six hours.
p294_298|p294|Who will provide the wine?
p294_267|p294|I would love to travel with it.
p294_273|p294|Boy is the town a mess.
p294_313|p294|We work for the athlete.
p294_307|p294|Cinema is a communal experience.
p294_139|p294|The objective was achieved.
p294_111|p294|We have great confidence in Derek.
p294_105|p294|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p294_104|p294|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p294_110|p294|This has gone on too long.
p294_138|p294|Above all, the approach is upbeat.
p294_306|p294|The order went out.
p294_312|p294|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
p294_272|p294|For now, they have gone as far as they can.
p294_266|p294|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p294_299|p294|We started from scratch.
p294_070|p294|I don't have any answer for them.
p294_064|p294|It is all about having physical evidence.
p294_058|p294|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p294_099|p294|So is that it, then?
p294_072|p294|I found the course inspiring.
p294_066|p294|What kind of inclusion is that?
p294_258|p294|They are in care for a reason.
p294_270|p294|We will work through the night.
p294_264|p294|It possibly depends on the position.
p294_338|p294|No-one else was hurt.
p294_304|p294|Could it have been better spent?
p294_310|p294|He added, We are full of anger.
p294_106|p294|The other conditions were not specified.
p294_112|p294|My ambition is to tell a good story.
p294_113|p294|I don't know the nature of the illness.
p294_107|p294|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p294_311|p294|They have nowhere else to go.
p294_305|p294|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p294_339|p294|What's it for?
p294_265|p294|This will have no effect on the championship.
p294_271|p294|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p294_259|p294|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p294_067|p294|I fell in love with it right away.
p294_073|p294|Two things were clear from the new programme.
p294_098|p294|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p294_095|p294|Was it a signal?
p294_081|p294|They could not have done more for me.
p294_056|p294|This is a possible way forward.
p294_042|p294|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p294_297|p294|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p294_283|p294|This is our unfinished business.
p294_254|p294|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p294_240|p294|We got the guarantee.
p294_268|p294|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p294_320|p294|Johnson was pretty low.
p294_334|p294|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
p294_308|p294|The appeal is impartial.
p294_122|p294|Did he just want to be on telly?
p294_136|p294|This takes the pressure off.
p294_137|p294|It was different in the endurance events.
p294_123|p294|He seems to be used to the attention.
p294_309|p294|You could see he was thinking about it.
p294_335|p294|But it took a lot of bottle.
p294_321|p294|We know we have done wrong.
p294_269|p294|It is a common condition in children.
p294_241|p294|I couldn't have asked for better.
p294_255|p294|There are still some matters to be discussed.
p294_282|p294|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p294_296|p294|It just would not work.
p294_043|p294|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p294_057|p294|I am not here to get even.
p294_080|p294|One policeman was killed.
p294_094|p294|It should be a condition of employment.
p294_082|p294|It was like a vacuum.
p294_096|p294|It may not even be possible.
p294_041|p294|I've been dying for an hour.
p294_055|p294|We should not bring him into a dispute.
p294_069|p294|It makes for an interesting conference.
p294_280|p294|It was one in the afternoon.
p294_294|p294|What do they do, anyway?
p294_243|p294|But happily, the story is true.
p294_257|p294|I get on him, he gets on me.
p294_337|p294|That period was a struggle.
p294_323|p294|I wanted to drop out.
p294_135|p294|It seemed to have direction.
p294_121|p294|We don't know what happened after.
p294_109|p294|That was the context of his remarks.
p294_108|p294|That's not part of the deal.
p294_120|p294|My father and mother are.
p294_134|p294|I have had a wonderful career.
p294_322|p294|She was married with one son.
p294_336|p294|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p294_256|p294|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p294_242|p294|That is however, the only part of the story.
p294_295|p294|They've got a mountain to climb.
p294_281|p294|I've never seen them down here.
p294_068|p294|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294_054|p294|What is the point of jailing him?
p294_040|p294|My view has now changed completely.
p294_097|p294|In fact, they go hand in hand.
p294_083|p294|That was enough for the committee.
p294_087|p294|They have to work so hard.
p294_093|p294|But now it's back to golf.
p294_078|p294|Subs not used, McGraw.
p294_044|p294|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p294_050|p294|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p294_285|p294|He had asked if they had the script.
p294_291|p294|There did not need to be a miracle.
p294_252|p294|His director of football is leaving.
p294_332|p294|The need for further investment is obvious.
p294_326|p294|Which is where the manager comes in.
p294_118|p294|We are the weakest link.
p294_130|p294|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p294_124|p294|It's an hour of the same response.
p294_125|p294|We have very real concerns about it.
p294_131|p294|I can't see him reversing that.
p294_119|p294|We have now no choice.
p294_327|p294|Is that what people we want?
p294_333|p294|Iraq has no interest in war.
p294_253|p294|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p294_247|p294|Everything else is the same.
p294_290|p294|It's a blunt instrument anyway.
p294_284|p294|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p294_051|p294|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
p294_045|p294|They tend to be female and retired.
p294_079|p294|Three bystanders were killed.
p294_092|p294|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p294_086|p294|We have to focus on what is important.
p294_090|p294|He had just returned from a run.
p294_084|p294|It is a very genuine prospect.
p294_053|p294|But we welcome this document.
p294_047|p294|This was no accident.
p294_292|p294|This could also affect the sentencing.
p294_286|p294|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p294_279|p294|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p294_251|p294|Mental health is a massive issue.
p294_245|p294|Some days are different from others.
p294_319|p294|It is an impressive record.
p294_325|p294|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p294_331|p294|I'm so happy that she did.
p294_127|p294|People will see this over time.
p294_133|p294|I can lead by example.
p294_132|p294|I'm deeply sorry they did.
p294_126|p294|He has gone through the process before.
p294_330|p294|He wants to play in the Champions League.
p294_324|p294|I told you so.
p294_318|p294|Now they have found out the truth.
p294_244|p294|They are not suitable.
p294_250|p294|There are no excuses left for us.
p294_278|p294|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p294_287|p294|This could take a few days.
p294_293|p294|That case has still not been settled.
p294_046|p294|Who was the mystery MP?
p294_052|p294|The course record was in his name.
p294_085|p294|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p294_091|p294|There's a strong involvement.
p294_035|p294|A neighbour said the street was shocked.
p294_021|p294|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p294_009|p294|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p294_237|p294|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p294_223|p294|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p294_380|p294|Visitors were also impressed.
p294_394|p294|And rugby fans can help.
p294_343|p294|There are moments of joy in politics.
p294_357|p294|He completely loses control.
p294_419|p294|We have every respect for Michelle.
p294_182|p294|A decision is expected in September.
p294_196|p294|I want a career.
p294_141|p294|He invented the language.
p294_155|p294|You feel the pride.
p294_169|p294|I enjoy my work.
p294_168|p294|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p294_154|p294|Therein lies the problem.
p294_140|p294|It was a hugely popular decision.
p294_197|p294|He said nothing to waiting journalists.
p294_183|p294|It was a big departure.
p294_418|p294|Or, rather, it isn't.
p294_356|p294|So far he has not done so.
p294_424|p294|He died at the hands of his captors.
p294_342|p294|She is an imposing presence.
p294_395|p294|The council's concern is very simple.
p294_381|p294|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p294_222|p294|She has so much to offer.
p294_236|p294|I just have to accept that.
p294_008|p294|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p294_020|p294|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p294_034|p294|Other people had looked at it.
p294_022|p294|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p294_036|p294|Michael, he is running!
p294_220|p294|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p294_234|p294|Who does he think will win?
p294_208|p294|This club is perfect for me.
p294_397|p294|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p294_383|p294|Are there muscular problems?
p294_354|p294|We didn't mean to kill him.
p294_340|p294|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p294_368|p294|He found it very hard to understand.
p294_195|p294|It is misleading to compare the two.
p294_181|p294|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
p294_156|p294|We are well insured.
p294_142|p294|Where are they?
p294_143|p294|It's hard not to.
p294_157|p294|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p294_180|p294|My place is in the kitchen.
p294_194|p294|You can't get a mortgage.
p294_369|p294|But it would change the context.
p294_341|p294|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p294_355|p294|The support of Britain is assumed.
p294_382|p294|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p294_396|p294|We are on the path of change.
p294_209|p294|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
p294_235|p294|We're talking about one or two years.
p294_221|p294|The six others were injured.
p294_037|p294|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p294_023|p294|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p294_027|p294|It means we have to have some patience.
p294_033|p294|The airport was even different.
p294_219|p294|Then they killed another three.
p294_225|p294|Gas is too expensive.
p294_231|p294|General, You didn't get a modified.
p294_392|p294|My mind was made up.
p294_386|p294|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p294_379|p294|He edited the press release.
p294_351|p294|That was the type of man he was.
p294_423|p294|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p294_345|p294|Where are you taking her?
p294_190|p294|Its role is not to interfere.
p294_184|p294|That's the name of the game, though.
p294_153|p294|Feel the air, the space.
p294_147|p294|She was always a quality act.
p294_146|p294|You ask the question.
p294_152|p294|It's a wonderful piece of water.
p294_185|p294|It's a huge amount.
p294_191|p294|It is becoming a bit of a habit.
p294_422|p294|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p294_344|p294|Is a drug dealer?
p294_350|p294|There were no violations.
p294_378|p294|There could be a way back.
p294_387|p294|He is in the queue.
p294_393|p294|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p294_230|p294|Who will run the bigger show?
p294_224|p294|It should be a pretty exciting session.
p294_218|p294|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p294_032|p294|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p294_026|p294|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
p294_018|p294|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p294_030|p294|He said she was mad.
p294_024|p294|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p294_232|p294|I'm not a little girl.
p294_226|p294|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p294_385|p294|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p294_391|p294|Calvin was back at his best today.
p294_408|p294|If you could find it.
p294_346|p294|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p294_420|p294|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p294_352|p294|They are not falling now.
p294_187|p294|I want my mum.
p294_193|p294|Something happened on that island.
p294_178|p294|Harry will be up for it.
p294_144|p294|It is a question of life and death.
p294_150|p294|It's a great idea.
p294_151|p294|It's like a score in some ways.
p294_145|p294|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p294_179|p294|He could tell you.
p294_192|p294|You can't believe a word.
p294_186|p294|The fire was falling from the sky.
p294_353|p294|They had to explain it.
p294_347|p294|It's just not our biggest problem.
p294_421|p294|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p294_409|p294|Such is the ego involved.
p294_390|p294|We have other options.
p294_384|p294|We had our chances.
p294_227|p294|Are we going mainstream?
p294_233|p294|We have seen the future, and it is different.
p294_025|p294|They were the better team on the night.
p294_031|p294|They were impressive against France.
p294_019|p294|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p269_348|p269|It's been hard.
p269_189|p269|We did everything by the book.
p269_162|p269|His death was a tragic accident.
p269_176|p269|They thought they had found a home.
p269_016|p269|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p269_002|p269|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p269_214|p269|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p269_200|p269|We played them off the pitch.
p269_228|p269|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p269_229|p269|I have spoken to the skipper.
p269_201|p269|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p269_215|p269|I began to pray.
p269_003|p269|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p269_017|p269|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p269_177|p269|His team management was protective.
p269_163|p269|This latter point is hugely important.
p269_188|p269|Four policemen were wounded.
p269_349|p269|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p269_375|p269|The play is based on a real-life event.
p269_361|p269|It is long gone.
p269_388|p269|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p269_377|p269|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p269_363|p269|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p269_175|p269|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p269_161|p269|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p269_149|p269|We just had a go.
p269_001|p269|Please call Stella.  
p269_015|p269|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p269_029|p269|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p269_203|p269|It was good fun.
p269_217|p269|It had all been arranged.
p269_216|p269|I am delighted for Simon.
p269_202|p269|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p269_028|p269|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p269_014|p269|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p269_148|p269|He is severe.
p269_160|p269|We want to see the maximum of change.
p269_174|p269|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p269_362|p269|I HAVE a dream.
p269_376|p269|He could face a jail sentence.
p269_389|p269|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p269_399|p269|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p269_372|p269|It's a true story.
p269_366|p269|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p269_400|p269|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p269_158|p269|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p269_170|p269|We have to move forward.
p269_164|p269|It is so unfair.
p269_038|p269|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p269_004|p269|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p269_010|p269|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p269_206|p269|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p269_212|p269|Feel the heat?
p269_213|p269|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p269_207|p269|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
p269_011|p269|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p269_005|p269|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p269_039|p269|That's no bad thing.
p269_165|p269|It is an attitude of mind.
p269_171|p269|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p269_159|p269|I was so nervous.
p269_367|p269|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p269_401|p269|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p269_373|p269|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p269_398|p269|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p269_359|p269|It was forced to divert.
p269_403|p269|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p269_365|p269|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p269_371|p269|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p269_198|p269|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p269_167|p269|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p269_173|p269|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p269_013|p269|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p269_007|p269|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p269_239|p269|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p269_211|p269|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p269_205|p269|It's all about money, money, money.
p269_204|p269|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p269_210|p269|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p269_238|p269|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p269_006|p269|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p269_012|p269|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p269_172|p269|I lost my head.
p269_166|p269|I've put my own money into this project.
p269_199|p269|The conference is the first test.
p269_370|p269|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p269_402|p269|The car was just there.
p269_364|p269|As, indeed, they would be.
p269_358|p269|A great deal has been achieved.
p269_303|p269|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p269_317|p269|It's just not funny!
p269_101|p269|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p269_115|p269|Maybe this battle has been.
p269_129|p269|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p269_075|p269|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p269_061|p269|There was a battle there.
p269_049|p269|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p269_288|p269|I saw it at a ruck.
p269_277|p269|They wanted the club to make money.
p269_263|p269|I am very angry.
p269_276|p269|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p269_289|p269|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p269_048|p269|He had no enemies.
p269_060|p269|They're appalled by that.
p269_074|p269|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p269_128|p269|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p269_114|p269|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p269_100|p269|May not have been at fault?
p269_316|p269|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p269_302|p269|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p269_314|p269|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p269_300|p269|It changed my life.
p269_328|p269|We are a peaceful people.
p269_116|p269|My office is bare.
p269_102|p269|Oil embargo endorsed.
p269_089|p269|You will be.
p269_062|p269|Scotland had great assets.
p269_076|p269|It is a job creation scheme.
p269_260|p269|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p269_274|p269|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p269_248|p269|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p269_249|p269|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p269_275|p269|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p269_261|p269|Kirkwood was arrested.
p269_077|p269|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p269_063|p269|It's that kind of place.
p269_088|p269|By then, he was walking on water.
p269_103|p269|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p269_117|p269|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p269_329|p269|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p269_301|p269|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p269_315|p269|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p269_339|p269|That's the law of the land.
p269_311|p269|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p269_305|p269|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p269_113|p269|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p269_107|p269|He pleaded for caution.
p269_098|p269|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p269_067|p269|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p269_073|p269|I was as strong as a horse.
p269_259|p269|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p269_265|p269|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p269_271|p269|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p269_270|p269|They are never here.
p269_264|p269|It is also very valuable.
p269_258|p269|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p269_072|p269|There could be a way back.
p269_066|p269|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p269_099|p269|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p269_106|p269|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p269_112|p269|It was the eighties.
p269_304|p269|A new school will be built.
p269_310|p269|But it's a subtle process.
p269_338|p269|I came into this world with nothing.
p269_306|p269|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p269_312|p269|There is no openness.
p269_138|p269|If not, a deal could take many months.
p269_104|p269|No date has been set for the appeal.
p269_110|p269|I can't even get into the A team.
p269_058|p269|You do not change overnight.
p269_070|p269|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p269_064|p269|They are real.
p269_299|p269|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p269_272|p269|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p269_266|p269|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p269_267|p269|The warning is timely.
p269_273|p269|It left me with a sadness.
p269_298|p269|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p269_065|p269|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p269_071|p269|It's a winner.
p269_059|p269|Art is extra.
p269_111|p269|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p269_105|p269|It's not perfect.
p269_139|p269|What will happen then?
p269_313|p269|They are wrong.
p269_307|p269|I was the sheep.
p269_322|p269|I did not name it.
p269_336|p269|In the old days, it was easy.
p269_134|p269|We had a reunion last week.
p269_108|p269|It was quite rigorous.
p269_097|p269|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p269_083|p269|I'd like to continue that record.
p269_054|p269|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p269_040|p269|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p269_068|p269|You need a trademark.
p269_295|p269|This is a national crisis.
p269_281|p269|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p269_256|p269|It is nearly there.
p269_242|p269|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p269_243|p269|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p269_257|p269|Special measures were needed.
p269_280|p269|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p269_294|p269|It's like a high school play.
p269_069|p269|Painful, but only because it's true.
p269_041|p269|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p269_055|p269|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p269_082|p269|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p269_096|p269|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p269_109|p269|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p269_135|p269|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p269_121|p269|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p269_337|p269|However, the groups denied the claims.
p269_323|p269|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p269_335|p269|They had a confession.
p269_321|p269|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p269_309|p269|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p269_137|p269|It's the big omission.
p269_123|p269|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p269_080|p269|People must remain vigilant.
p269_094|p269|They've got to account for it.
p269_043|p269|It was ugly.
p269_057|p269|None has ever been found.
p269_282|p269|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p269_296|p269|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p269_241|p269|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p269_255|p269|I can't get a job.
p269_269|p269|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p269_268|p269|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p269_254|p269|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p269_240|p269|It's quite nice.
p269_297|p269|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p269_283|p269|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p269_056|p269|We are a grandmother.
p269_042|p269|I was scared.
p269_081|p269|This is the way things should be handled.
p269_122|p269|She has been shot.
p269_136|p269|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p269_308|p269|Graeme was prepared.
p269_320|p269|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p269_334|p269|Referees are easy targets.
p269_318|p269|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p269_330|p269|Kids are terrible.
p269_324|p269|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p269_132|p269|Who will attend?
p269_126|p269|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p269_085|p269|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p269_091|p269|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p269_046|p269|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p269_052|p269|It's very odd.
p269_287|p269|They were too hard.
p269_293|p269|Who will perform?
p269_278|p269|It's a way of life.
p269_244|p269|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p269_250|p269|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p269_251|p269|I was shocked.
p269_245|p269|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p269_279|p269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p269_292|p269|It was a virus.
p269_286|p269|If not, he should go home.
p269_053|p269|We have not given up hope.
p269_047|p269|Who can say?
p269_090|p269|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p269_084|p269|That is bound to happen.
p269_127|p269|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p269_133|p269|Twaddle is a case in point.
p269_325|p269|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p269_331|p269|Henman has been warned.
p269_319|p269|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p269_327|p269|I was rubbish.
p269_333|p269|The problems began a long time ago.
p269_119|p269|It was a delight on every level.
p269_125|p269|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p269_131|p269|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p269_092|p269|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
p269_086|p269|All options are open.
p269_079|p269|Even the one she loved.
p269_051|p269|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p269_045|p269|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p269_290|p269|You've got to have both sides.
p269_284|p269|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p269_253|p269|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p269_247|p269|You can feel at home in China.
p269_246|p269|I know I'm in a very special position.
p269_252|p269|I should think so, too.
p269_285|p269|It happens from time to time.
p269_291|p269|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p269_044|p269|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p269_050|p269|I was inspired by two things.
p269_078|p269|He is now resident in England.
p269_087|p269|Someone who cares
p269_093|p269|Today I couldn't run on it.
p269_130|p269|So the European elections are extremely important.
p269_124|p269|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p269_118|p269|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p269_332|p269|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p269_326|p269|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p269_382|p269|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p269_396|p269|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p269_341|p269|It is a strong case.
p269_355|p269|The train was on time.
p269_369|p269|I expected these kind of questions.
p269_180|p269|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p269_194|p269|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p269_143|p269|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p269_157|p269|He will emerge as a world leader.
p269_037|p269|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p269_023|p269|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p269_235|p269|And thought we would get away with it.
p269_221|p269|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p269_209|p269|But I am a worried man.
p269_208|p269|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p269_220|p269|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p269_234|p269|It's like a basketball.
p269_022|p269|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows. 
p269_036|p269|A web site is planned for November.
p269_156|p269|That group reported just before Christmas.
p269_142|p269|It's a question of fashion.
p269_195|p269|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p269_181|p269|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p269_368|p269|We will be homeless.
p269_354|p269|You feel the pride.
p269_340|p269|There was no time scale.
p269_397|p269|I suspect the latter.
p269_383|p269|They haven't got a hope.
p269_395|p269|It is unusual.
p269_381|p269|It is a large number.
p269_356|p269|It was so new, so exciting.
p269_342|p269|Is there a new way forward?
p269_197|p269|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p269_183|p269|Everyone can be bought.
p269_154|p269|It's like a football team.
p269_140|p269|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p269_168|p269|I am now unemployed.
p269_020|p269|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p269_034|p269|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p269_008|p269|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p269_222|p269|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p269_236|p269|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p269_237|p269|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p269_223|p269|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p269_009|p269|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p269_035|p269|Help is needed.
p269_021|p269|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases. 
p269_169|p269|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p269_141|p269|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p269_155|p269|It would be a last resort.
p269_182|p269|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p269_196|p269|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p269_343|p269|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p269_357|p269|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p269_380|p269|They play together perfectly.
p269_394|p269|I'm pleased about one thing.
p269_384|p269|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p269_353|p269|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p269_347|p269|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p269_186|p269|It's an idea.
p269_179|p269|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p269_151|p269|We have seen a copy of the report.
p269_145|p269|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p269_019|p269|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p269_025|p269|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p269_031|p269|Is this accurate?
p269_227|p269|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p269_233|p269|But she was.
p269_232|p269|My neighbours are horrified.
p269_226|p269|It's so special.
p269_030|p269|I have a theory.
p269_024|p269|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p269_018|p269|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p269_144|p269|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p269_150|p269|She died at her home.
p269_187|p269|They will run a mile.
p269_193|p269|It had been in place since last July.
p269_346|p269|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p269_352|p269|It has moved on in the last week.
p269_385|p269|He denied the charge.
p269_391|p269|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
p269_387|p269|I am very happy with life.
p269_393|p269|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p269_378|p269|They have not done so this season so far.
p269_344|p269|The boat was fantastic.
p269_350|p269|It is a sign of hope.
p269_185|p269|They know no other way.
p269_191|p269|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p269_146|p269|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p269_152|p269|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p269_032|p269|Because we do not need it.
p269_026|p269|But it failed.
p269_218|p269|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p269_230|p269|I'd never seen a play about me.
p269_224|p269|Who was on the panel?
p269_225|p269|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p269_231|p269|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p269_219|p269|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p269_027|p269|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p269_033|p269|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p269_153|p269|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p269_147|p269|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p269_190|p269|Does this matter?
p269_184|p269|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p269_345|p269|I'd like to take the plunge.
p269_379|p269|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p269_392|p269|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p269_386|p269|You can cope with it.
p256_229|p256|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p256_201|p256|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p256_215|p256|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p256_188|p256|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p256_177|p256|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p256_163|p256|We have to move forward.
p256_162|p256|It has to be now.
p256_176|p256|The hotel was now for sale.
p256_189|p256|It is a terrible loss.
p256_214|p256|The FBI could become involved.
p256_200|p256|I have a cold.
p256_228|p256|The track is currently covered in snow.
p256_016|p256|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p256_002|p256|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p256_028|p256|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p256_014|p256|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p256_216|p256|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p256_202|p256|Tommy is not a problem.
p256_148|p256|I was so nervous.
p256_160|p256|I will tell you.
p256_174|p256|It is not either national standards or local control.
p256_175|p256|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p256_161|p256|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p256_149|p256|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p256_203|p256|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p256_217|p256|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p256_001|p256|Please call Stella.  
p256_015|p256|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p256_029|p256|There's a story, too.
p256_011|p256|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p256_005|p256|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p256_039|p256|It's a real threat.
p256_213|p256|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p256_207|p256|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p256_165|p256|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p256_171|p256|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p256_159|p256|These days are long gone.
p256_158|p256|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p256_170|p256|Does that put pressure on us?
p256_164|p256|They are not advertised.
p256_206|p256|It was worth a photograph.
p256_212|p256|It had all been arranged.
p256_038|p256|They're just different.
p256_004|p256|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p256_010|p256|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p256_006|p256|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p256_012|p256|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p256_204|p256|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p256_210|p256|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p256_238|p256|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p256_199|p256|People acted too quickly.
p256_172|p256|It is too much for me.
p256_166|p256|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p256_167|p256|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p256_173|p256|We've made a couple of albums.
p256_198|p256|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p256_239|p256|He was good, but not that good.
p256_211|p256|She should not be blamed.
p256_205|p256|But she might be.
p256_013|p256|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p256_007|p256|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p256_048|p256|It's a crucial award.
p256_060|p256|That's the truth.
p256_074|p256|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p256_289|p256|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p256_262|p256|I am very angry.
p256_276|p256|I am an estate agent.
p256_316|p256|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p256_302|p256|The party lasted all night.
p256_128|p256|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p256_114|p256|It was the eighties.
p256_100|p256|There was no rescue.
p256_101|p256|We could not get any possession.
p256_115|p256|They were behind the wheel.
p256_129|p256|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p256_303|p256|It's so awful.
p256_317|p256|She is very distinctive.
p256_277|p256|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p256_263|p256|The pensioners did not want to know.
p256_288|p256|He was obviously very genuine.
p256_075|p256|I was as strong as a horse.
p256_061|p256|That is very hard, alone.
p256_049|p256|It is difficult for Ali.
p256_088|p256|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p256_077|p256|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p256_063|p256|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p256_249|p256|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p256_275|p256|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p256_261|p256|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p256_301|p256|Our task is to complete the picture.
p256_315|p256|They were fantastic.
p256_103|p256|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p256_117|p256|It was ugly.
p256_116|p256|This is a step backwards.
p256_102|p256|They are now divorced.
p256_314|p256|It is all credit to them today.
p256_300|p256|One was a lawyer.
p256_260|p256|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p256_274|p256|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p256_248|p256|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p256_062|p256|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p256_076|p256|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p256_089|p256|It's never too late.
p256_099|p256|It was clear.
p256_072|p256|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p256_066|p256|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p256_270|p256|He has not created a Festival resource.
p256_264|p256|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p256_258|p256|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p256_304|p256|It's just not funny!
p256_310|p256|We have waited a long time for this.
p256_106|p256|Get to know him.
p256_112|p256|They will want to perform well.
p256_113|p256|It's not perfect.
p256_107|p256|But it was a pleasure.
p256_311|p256|This is the culture change in medicine.
p256_305|p256|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p256_259|p256|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p256_265|p256|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p256_271|p256|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p256_067|p256|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p256_073|p256|It should be devolved.
p256_098|p256|She told The Herald.
p256_065|p256|It's a matter of balance.
p256_071|p256|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p256_059|p256|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p256_298|p256|I thought it was my only chance.
p256_267|p256|That's the only thing I will say.
p256_273|p256|And Michael was just great.
p256_313|p256|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p256_307|p256|It is no surprise.
p256_111|p256|Before the game we went for a pint.
p256_105|p256|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p256_139|p256|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p256_138|p256|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p256_104|p256|Journalists should make him.
p256_110|p256|I didn't play well last year.
p256_306|p256|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p256_312|p256|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p256_272|p256|It was an easy decision to come here.
p256_266|p256|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p256_058|p256|It is unique.
p256_070|p256|They are real.
p256_064|p256|And a film maker was born.
p256_082|p256|This is the way things should be handled.
p256_096|p256|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p256_069|p256|There was a battle there.
p256_041|p256|It had been played at festivals.
p256_055|p256|He had no enemies.
p256_280|p256|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p256_294|p256|Who can predict?
p256_243|p256|It is hard won.
p256_257|p256|Chelsea was a great club.
p256_109|p256|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p256_135|p256|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p256_121|p256|Who would be a referee?
p256_120|p256|It is rubbish.
p256_134|p256|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p256_108|p256|We have every respect for Michelle.
p256_256|p256|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p256_242|p256|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p256_295|p256|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
p256_281|p256|But I've won both ways.
p256_054|p256|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p256_040|p256|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p256_068|p256|They may yet have the last laugh.
p256_097|p256|They've got to account for it.
p256_083|p256|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p256_095|p256|We must look forward.
p256_081|p256|I've got the shirt.
p256_056|p256|Sadly, it can't.
p256_042|p256|Indeed, he does.
p256_297|p256|The home was now under new management.
p256_283|p256|The attacker died in the crash.
p256_268|p256|It looks as though he will be right.
p256_254|p256|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p256_240|p256|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p256_308|p256|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p256_320|p256|It should be equal.
p256_122|p256|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p256_136|p256|Our intentions are real.
p256_137|p256|It is also well received.
p256_123|p256|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p256_309|p256|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p256_241|p256|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p256_255|p256|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p256_269|p256|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p256_282|p256|I saw it at a ruck.
p256_296|p256|It became a book by itself.
p256_043|p256|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p256_057|p256|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p256_080|p256|It is a terrible place.
p256_094|p256|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p256_090|p256|It was nice.
p256_084|p256|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p256_053|p256|I would love to have him home.
p256_047|p256|A neighbour said.
p256_292|p256|The results are sometimes contentious.
p256_286|p256|Scotland were beaten again.
p256_251|p256|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p256_245|p256|The scene is about this?
p256_279|p256|It happens from time to time.
p256_319|p256|Henman has been warned.
p256_127|p256|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p256_133|p256|Who will attend?
p256_132|p256|Well, you can have a tree.
p256_126|p256|There were no grounds for his action.
p256_318|p256|It's not even finished.
p256_278|p256|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p256_244|p256|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p256_250|p256|It was a hit.
p256_287|p256|It's very safe.
p256_293|p256|The songs are just so good.
p256_046|p256|That period was a struggle.
p256_052|p256|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p256_085|p256|It may well have been.
p256_091|p256|We do not get that impression now.
p256_087|p256|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p256_093|p256|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p256_044|p256|This film will be totally awesome.
p256_050|p256|It's a blessing.
p256_078|p256|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p256_285|p256|It's like a high school play.
p256_291|p256|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p256_246|p256|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p256_252|p256|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p256_130|p256|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p256_124|p256|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p256_118|p256|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p256_119|p256|I joined a group.
p256_125|p256|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p256_131|p256|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p256_253|p256|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p256_247|p256|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p256_290|p256|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p256_284|p256|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p256_079|p256|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p256_051|p256|Is a drug dealer?
p256_045|p256|No meaningful response was issued.
p256_092|p256|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p256_086|p256|I first met him last summer.
p256_022|p256|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p256_036|p256|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p256_208|p256|It's like a garage.
p256_220|p256|It's so special.
p256_234|p256|It's quite nice.
p256_195|p256|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p256_181|p256|Nothing is safe.
p256_156|p256|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p256_142|p256|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p256_143|p256|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p256_157|p256|He can do no wrong.
p256_180|p256|There is no point in looking any further.
p256_194|p256|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p256_235|p256|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p256_221|p256|We will be victorious.
p256_209|p256|But I am a worried man.
p256_037|p256|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p256_023|p256|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p256_009|p256|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p256_035|p256|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p256_021|p256|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p256_237|p256|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p256_223|p256|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p256_182|p256|They will run a mile.
p256_196|p256|It is a case of taking a risk.
p256_169|p256|The post will be unpaid.
p256_141|p256|We want to keep the pound.
p256_155|p256|We will turn the corner.
p256_154|p256|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p256_140|p256|It was very frightened and dirty.
p256_168|p256|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p256_197|p256|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p256_183|p256|Four policemen were wounded.
p256_222|p256|He seemed to lose his focus.
p256_236|p256|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p256_020|p256|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p256_034|p256|A web site is planned for November.
p256_008|p256|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p256_030|p256|I was an athlete.
p256_024|p256|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p256_018|p256|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p256_232|p256|The body follows the mind.
p256_226|p256|It is a gamble.
p256_187|p256|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p256_193|p256|I grew up listening to these people.
p256_144|p256|It changed my life.
p256_150|p256|They have not been named.
p256_178|p256|They took a risk.
p256_179|p256|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p256_151|p256|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p256_145|p256|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p256_192|p256|I am totally surprised.
p256_186|p256|They need to look after themselves.
p256_227|p256|My neighbours are horrified.
p256_233|p256|It is set in Paris.
p256_019|p256|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p256_025|p256|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p256_031|p256|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p256_027|p256|I have a theory.
p256_033|p256|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p256_225|p256|I am immensely sad.
p256_231|p256|My wife and family are the support system.
p256_219|p256|We've got the bronze.
p256_190|p256|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p256_184|p256|They receive a high profile in the media.
p256_153|p256|It was by the numbers.
p256_147|p256|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p256_146|p256|It is not just about pay.
p256_152|p256|We should be clear about the role of government.
p256_185|p256|We did everything by the book.
p256_191|p256|If the director is with you.
p256_218|p256|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p256_230|p256|They are the innocent victims.
p256_224|p256|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p256_032|p256|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p256_026|p256|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p251_255|p251|It is hard won.
p251_282|p251|That's the only thing I will say.
p251_296|p251|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p251_043|p251|Dancing was her life.
p251_057|p251|What was the main difference?
p251_080|p251|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p251_094|p251|If you could find it.
p251_137|p251|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p251_123|p251|I'm so angry.
p251_309|p251|Who did the recruiting?
p251_335|p251|There was no time scale.
p251_321|p251|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p251_320|p251|Our task is to complete the picture.
p251_334|p251|That's the law of the land.
p251_308|p251|Scotland were beaten again.
p251_122|p251|She has been shot.
p251_136|p251|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p251_095|p251|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p251_081|p251|War is not the action.
p251_056|p251|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p251_042|p251|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p251_297|p251|I am an estate agent.
p251_283|p251|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p251_254|p251|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p251_240|p251|However, no further action was taken by police.
p251_268|p251|They are interior designers and architects.
p251_256|p251|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p251_242|p251|They had no children.
p251_295|p251|It's a way of life.
p251_281|p251|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p251_068|p251|That was the easy election.
p251_054|p251|I had relied on him.
p251_040|p251|It was clear.
p251_097|p251|They were outside the circle.
p251_083|p251|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p251_108|p251|I came to complete.
p251_120|p251|We work on the same level.
p251_134|p251|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p251_322|p251|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p251_336|p251|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p251_337|p251|It's not long enough.
p251_323|p251|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p251_135|p251|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p251_121|p251|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p251_109|p251|You had better believe it.
p251_082|p251|You will be.
p251_096|p251|Journalists should make him.
p251_041|p251|They may be wrong.
p251_055|p251|This is a step backwards.
p251_069|p251|There could be a way back.
p251_280|p251|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p251_294|p251|Things can change.
p251_243|p251|It is set in Paris.
p251_257|p251|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p251_253|p251|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p251_247|p251|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p251_290|p251|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p251_284|p251|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p251_051|p251|He had no enemies.
p251_045|p251|I feel pretty good.
p251_079|p251|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p251_092|p251|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p251_125|p251|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p251_131|p251|If not, a deal could take many months.
p251_119|p251|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p251_327|p251|We are a peaceful people.
p251_333|p251|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p251_332|p251|However, the groups denied the claims.
p251_326|p251|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p251_118|p251|It is rubbish.
p251_130|p251|We had a reunion last week.
p251_124|p251|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p251_087|p251|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p251_093|p251|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p251_078|p251|I was too young.
p251_044|p251|We will push.
p251_050|p251|It is the whole package.
p251_285|p251|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p251_291|p251|We're in shock.
p251_246|p251|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p251_252|p251|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p251_244|p251|They should come forward.
p251_250|p251|My future is in the marathon.
p251_278|p251|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p251_287|p251|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p251_293|p251|One knows the feeling.
p251_046|p251|That should do it.
p251_052|p251|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p251_085|p251|We have turned the corner.
p251_091|p251|Until you hit the big games.
p251_132|p251|Government will intervene.
p251_126|p251|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p251_330|p251|It is out there.
p251_324|p251|You are the glory.
p251_318|p251|He said she was mad.
p251_319|p251|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p251_325|p251|The letters are going out today.
p251_331|p251|They had a confession.
p251_127|p251|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p251_133|p251|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p251_090|p251|It is an old family habit.
p251_084|p251|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p251_053|p251|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p251_047|p251|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p251_292|p251|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p251_286|p251|He has not created a Festival resource.
p251_279|p251|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
p251_251|p251|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p251_245|p251|It's quite a line-up!
p251_222|p251|Work has started.
p251_236|p251|It is a gamble.
p251_008|p251|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
p251_020|p251|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
p251_034|p251|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p251_168|p251|The post will be unpaid.
p251_154|p251|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p251_140|p251|I am totally devoted to this job.
p251_197|p251|It wasn't to be.
p251_183|p251|We did everything by the book.
p251_356|p251|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p251_342|p251|Is that an issue?
p251_343|p251|He can do no wrong.
p251_357|p251|The composer will conduct.
p251_182|p251|Four policemen were wounded.
p251_196|p251|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p251_141|p251|Three penalties were given.
p251_155|p251|I knew he was good.
p251_169|p251|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p251_035|p251|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p251_021|p251|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p251_009|p251|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
p251_237|p251|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p251_223|p251|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p251_209|p251|Today was first class.
p251_235|p251|I'd never seen a play about me.
p251_221|p251|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p251_037|p251|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p251_023|p251|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p251_143|p251|We just had a go.
p251_157|p251|There's a pause.
p251_180|p251|We knew nothing about it.
p251_194|p251|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p251_369|p251|That would help.
p251_341|p251|It could have gone either way.
p251_355|p251|I'm very lucky.
p251_340|p251|The police have to act to help them.
p251_368|p251|We will be homeless.
p251_195|p251|It is a case of taking a risk.
p251_181|p251|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p251_156|p251|I saw one body.
p251_142|p251|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p251_022|p251|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p251_036|p251|Was it worth it?
p251_220|p251|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p251_234|p251|I am immensely sad.
p251_208|p251|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p251_230|p251|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p251_224|p251|It's just a place to open it.
p251_218|p251|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p251_032|p251|It's a matter of balance.
p251_026|p251|But it failed.
p251_146|p251|It is like a football team.
p251_152|p251|He seemed to lose his focus.
p251_185|p251|We want to help them through it.
p251_191|p251|Last night was a key episode.
p251_344|p251|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p251_350|p251|He did a good job.
p251_351|p251|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p251_345|p251|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p251_190|p251|However, this idea is never developed.
p251_184|p251|What has caused the demise of singing?
p251_153|p251|It is not normal practice.
p251_147|p251|That group reported just before Christmas.
p251_027|p251|That's no bad thing.
p251_033|p251|Peace was won.
p251_219|p251|We have got to get it right.
p251_225|p251|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p251_231|p251|We played them off the pitch.
p251_227|p251|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p251_233|p251|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p251_025|p251|Johnson was pretty low.
p251_019|p251|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
p251_151|p251|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p251_145|p251|The songs are just so good.
p251_179|p251|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p251_192|p251|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p251_186|p251|I cannot say too much about them.
p251_353|p251|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p251_347|p251|The team for the first game could be this one.
p251_346|p251|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p251_352|p251|Well, it won't.
p251_187|p251|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p251_193|p251|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p251_178|p251|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p251_144|p251|We have seen a copy of the report.
p251_150|p251|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p251_018|p251|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
p251_030|p251|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p251_024|p251|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p251_232|p251|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p251_226|p251|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p251_203|p251|The conference is the first test.
p251_217|p251|I began to pray.
p251_029|p251|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p251_001|p251|Please call Stella.  
p251_015|p251|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p251_149|p251|You know the type.
p251_175|p251|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p251_161|p251|Eight months later, he was dead.
p251_362|p251|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p251_160|p251|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p251_174|p251|The jury is still out.
p251_148|p251|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p251_014|p251|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p251_028|p251|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p251_216|p251|Twaddle is a case in point.
p251_202|p251|There was no option.
p251_228|p251|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p251_214|p251|There was an e-mail.
p251_200|p251|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p251_016|p251|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
p251_002|p251|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
p251_162|p251|We have to move forward.
p251_176|p251|It is not either national standards or local control.
p251_189|p251|People will ask about us.
p251_348|p251|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p251_360|p251|They got upset.
p251_374|p251|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p251_361|p251|I saw some good things.
p251_349|p251|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p251_188|p251|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p251_177|p251|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p251_163|p251|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p251_003|p251|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p251_017|p251|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p251_201|p251|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p251_215|p251|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p251_211|p251|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p251_205|p251|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p251_239|p251|We were awful.
p251_013|p251|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
p251_007|p251|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p251_167|p251|You are not going in blind.
p251_173|p251|One season, they might do well.
p251_198|p251|It was typical.
p251_365|p251|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p251_359|p251|It is not like working for a living.
p251_364|p251|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p251_199|p251|It's the same old story.
p251_172|p251|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p251_166|p251|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p251_006|p251|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p251_012|p251|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
p251_238|p251|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p251_204|p251|I saw some terrible things.
p251_210|p251|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p251_206|p251|A deadline is still essential.
p251_212|p251|We have an election in eight days.
p251_004|p251|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
p251_010|p251|People look, but no one ever finds it. 
p251_038|p251|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p251_170|p251|They thought they had found a home.
p251_164|p251|Tell it like it was?
p251_158|p251|Neither side can win this war.
p251_372|p251|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p251_366|p251|However, it was well worth the wait.
p251_367|p251|He has seen the past.
p251_373|p251|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p251_159|p251|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p251_165|p251|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p251_171|p251|I always felt they played for me.
p251_039|p251|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p251_011|p251|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
p251_005|p251|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
p251_213|p251|Now, it's all right.
p251_207|p251|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p251_248|p251|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p251_260|p251|His body was never found.
p251_274|p251|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p251_062|p251|It's that kind of place.
p251_076|p251|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p251_089|p251|We must look forward.
p251_116|p251|I joined a group.
p251_102|p251|That is no use.
p251_328|p251|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p251_314|p251|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p251_300|p251|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p251_301|p251|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p251_315|p251|A new school will be built.
p251_329|p251|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p251_103|p251|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p251_117|p251|Does this mean.
p251_088|p251|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p251_077|p251|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p251_063|p251|It was all in a short period of time.
p251_275|p251|I am very angry.
p251_249|p251|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p251_263|p251|It was a hit.
p251_288|p251|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p251_049|p251|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p251_075|p251|Today she has been released.
p251_061|p251|They're appalled by that.
p251_129|p251|It was the same at Twickenham.
p251_101|p251|It is a good lifestyle.
p251_115|p251|Maybe this battle has been.
p251_303|p251|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p251_317|p251|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p251_316|p251|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p251_302|p251|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p251_114|p251|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p251_100|p251|No date has been set for the appeal.
p251_128|p251|Well, you can have a tree.
p251_060|p251|It is not great art.
p251_074|p251|I've not thought about it.
p251_048|p251|As she explains.
p251_289|p251|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p251_262|p251|He's a lovely young man.
p251_276|p251|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p251_272|p251|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p251_266|p251|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p251_299|p251|She looked so young.
p251_070|p251|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p251_064|p251|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p251_058|p251|Four other charges were dropped.
p251_104|p251|Further protests are likely.
p251_110|p251|I was angry.
p251_138|p251|Is that it?
p251_306|p251|Who will perform?
p251_312|p251|The results are sometimes contentious.
p251_313|p251|These figures are truly awful.
p251_307|p251|This is a national crisis.
p251_139|p251|I had decided to quit the show.
p251_111|p251|The fire was above the hole.
p251_105|p251|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p251_059|p251|It's a real challenge.
p251_065|p251|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p251_071|p251|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p251_298|p251|People have no choice.
p251_267|p251|We run within the law.
p251_273|p251|I was happily surprised.
p251_265|p251|They know no other way.
p251_271|p251|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p251_259|p251|They tried to give her advice.
p251_067|p251|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p251_073|p251|It is a time bomb.
p251_098|p251|Two of the team became ill.
p251_113|p251|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p251_107|p251|It had been played at festivals.
p251_311|p251|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p251_305|p251|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p251_339|p251|He was not a big name.
p251_338|p251|I am so upset.
p251_304|p251|You've got to have both sides.
p251_310|p251|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p251_106|p251|He was jailed for a year.
p251_112|p251|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p251_099|p251|That would be unlawful.
p251_072|p251|It was chaotic.
p251_066|p251|He was popular.
p251_258|p251|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p251_270|p251|they fail to engage.
p251_264|p251|We are ready.
p323_020|p323|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p323_236|p323|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p323_222|p323|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p323_381|p323|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p323_395|p323|He already had had complaints.
p323_418|p323|We tend to come good at the end.
p323_342|p323|Everyone thought they were safe.
p323_356|p323|I understand the medical concerns.
p323_183|p323|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p323_197|p323|It was a good atmosphere.
p323_168|p323|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p323_140|p323|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p323_154|p323|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p323_155|p323|The encounter was to change his life.
p323_141|p323|What exactly is your job?
p323_169|p323|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p323_196|p323|We work for the athlete.
p323_182|p323|He was married with children.
p323_357|p323|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p323_343|p323|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
p323_419|p323|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p323_394|p323|I want to go home.
p323_380|p323|He must be seen to be impartial.
p323_223|p323|I became a widow overnight.
p323_237|p323|He predicted the contest would be very close.
p323_021|p323|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p323_035|p323|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p323_009|p323|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p323_023|p323|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p323_037|p323|They discussed how he might get involved.
p323_209|p323|I am pretty careful with money.
p323_221|p323|He was married with a young child.
p323_235|p323|I think my game is suited to grass.
p323_396|p323|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
p323_382|p323|That will be the sweetness.
p323_369|p323|They were behind the wheel.
p323_355|p323|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p323_341|p323|I was loving that little girl.
p323_194|p323|You could see he was thinking about it.
p323_180|p323|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p323_157|p323|I've never seen them down here.
p323_143|p323|She is now planning a visit.
p323_142|p323|They would love to do more films.
p323_156|p323|They should not have behaved in that way.
p323_181|p323|This is a mental challenge.
p323_195|p323|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p323_340|p323|It is a love affair.
p323_354|p323|He died at the hands of his captors.
p323_368|p323|There are simply no orders.
p323_383|p323|The law will take its course.
p323_397|p323|Of course he does!
p323_234|p323|Is your life a little too easy?
p323_220|p323|We did not even get a free kick.
p323_208|p323|Post offices are closing now.
p323_036|p323|It is misleading to compare the two.
p323_022|p323|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p323_026|p323|Film music was never the same again.
p323_032|p323|Leisure centres were also affected.
p323_224|p323|We aren't going to play better.
p323_230|p323|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p323_218|p323|The process itself has taken over.
p323_393|p323|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
p323_387|p323|There was a fossil on screen.
p323_350|p323|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p323_422|p323|I wish it well.
p323_344|p323|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p323_378|p323|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p323_191|p323|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p323_185|p323|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p323_152|p323|What's it got to do with art?
p323_146|p323|Boy is the town a mess.
p323_147|p323|Do yourselves a favour.
p323_153|p323|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p323_184|p323|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p323_190|p323|It is time to come into the limelight.
p323_379|p323|I'll have to work on that.
p323_423|p323|Harold is a rarity.
p323_345|p323|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p323_351|p323|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p323_386|p323|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p323_392|p323|This does not create any precedent.
p323_219|p323|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p323_231|p323|I am an estate agent.
p323_225|p323|That was the case with David.
p323_033|p323|Something happened on that island.
p323_027|p323|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p323_031|p323|Its role is not to interfere.
p323_025|p323|We've made a couple of albums.
p323_019|p323|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p323_233|p323|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p323_227|p323|But who cares?
p323_384|p323|The idea has potential for the future.
p323_390|p323|There is great interest on our island.
p323_347|p323|Before the game we went for a pint.
p323_421|p323|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p323_353|p323|At the same time it is a satire.
p323_409|p323|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p323_186|p323|The game is now open.
p323_192|p323|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p323_145|p323|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p323_151|p323|We can do both.
p323_179|p323|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
p323_178|p323|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p323_150|p323|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p323_144|p323|New blood is essential for progress.
p323_193|p323|We have got to get it right.
p323_187|p323|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p323_408|p323|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p323_352|p323|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p323_346|p323|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p323_420|p323|The commission is not the only loser.
p323_391|p323|Later they changed their minds.
p323_385|p323|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p323_226|p323|They loved it and it showed.
p323_232|p323|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
p323_018|p323|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p323_024|p323|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p323_030|p323|This is the best way to do it.
p323_094|p323|He was not able to talk to us.
p323_080|p323|Who will run the bigger show?
p323_057|p323|However this weekend it will be different.
p323_043|p323|Now they have found out the truth.
p323_296|p323|I have never seen anything like it.
p323_282|p323|It all changes for her.
p323_269|p323|The same goes for Russia.
p323_255|p323|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
p323_241|p323|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
p323_309|p323|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p323_321|p323|My mother was getting on at me.
p323_335|p323|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p323_123|p323|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p323_137|p323|Everything was a dead end.
p323_136|p323|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
p323_122|p323|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p323_334|p323|It was not known to myself.
p323_320|p323|It was a virus.
p323_308|p323|We have other options.
p323_240|p323|The key issue for us is public safety.
p323_254|p323|Everything is up for grabs.
p323_268|p323|It is a very beautiful city.
p323_283|p323|We aim to put them out of business.
p323_297|p323|I've got the shirt.
p323_042|p323|What is next?
p323_056|p323|They may have been murdered.
p323_081|p323|General, You didn't get a modified.
p323_095|p323|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p323_083|p323|These things just happen.
p323_097|p323|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p323_068|p323|We were beaten by the better team today.
p323_040|p323|They were not up to speed.
p323_054|p323|I don't think it is a drawback.
p323_281|p323|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p323_295|p323|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p323_242|p323|I went home and wrote about it.
p323_256|p323|We are a new department.
p323_336|p323|It is a vicious circle.
p323_322|p323|But it wasn't to be.
p323_108|p323|I've had a very long run.
p323_134|p323|It was no more than they deserved.
p323_120|p323|We have a high quality product.
p323_121|p323|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p323_135|p323|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p323_109|p323|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p323_323|p323|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p323_337|p323|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p323_257|p323|Are we here?
p323_243|p323|The result could be all down to turnout.
p323_294|p323|She died in hospital two hours later.
p323_280|p323|Have a look at our accounts.
p323_055|p323|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p323_041|p323|We know the quality of life goes up.
p323_069|p323|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p323_096|p323|There is no conflict of interest.
p323_082|p323|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p323_086|p323|It's an interesting debate to get going.
p323_092|p323|Will they fall out?
p323_045|p323|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
p323_051|p323|What's it for?
p323_079|p323|The punishment was swift.
p323_284|p323|Is it a threat to union?
p323_290|p323|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p323_247|p323|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p323_253|p323|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p323_333|p323|She was totally possessed.
p323_327|p323|It's such a shock.
p323_131|p323|We are in a very strong position.
p323_125|p323|I have been to see him.
p323_119|p323|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p323_118|p323|If it does it means he has failed.
p323_124|p323|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p323_130|p323|I see no need for change.
p323_326|p323|We will deal with the refugees.
p323_332|p323|Such is the ego involved.
p323_252|p323|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p323_246|p323|It appears to have been closed down.
p323_291|p323|He was just awesome.
p323_285|p323|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
p323_078|p323|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p323_050|p323|We have been let down by these people.
p323_044|p323|We've still got a say in this.
p323_093|p323|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p323_087|p323|Who does he think will win?
p323_091|p323|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p323_085|p323|Are you up for business?
p323_052|p323|Nor does he have any desire to be.
p323_046|p323|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p323_293|p323|Maybe his time has gone.
p323_287|p323|Tony Blair should get out more.
p323_250|p323|So far he has not done so.
p323_244|p323|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p323_278|p323|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p323_324|p323|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p323_330|p323|It was very well received.
p323_318|p323|This rule is archaic.
p323_126|p323|I try not to expect anything.
p323_132|p323|This will have no effect on the championship.
p323_133|p323|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p323_127|p323|I would never say anything against her.
p323_319|p323|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p323_331|p323|If you could find it.
p323_325|p323|Then there is the terrain.
p323_279|p323|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p323_245|p323|There were no violations.
p323_251|p323|Maybe they will show it next year.
p323_286|p323|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
p323_292|p323|No decision has yet been made.
p323_047|p323|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p323_053|p323|How well did they get on?
p323_084|p323|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p323_090|p323|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p323_089|p323|An announcement will follow in due course.
p323_076|p323|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p323_062|p323|This is the place to play football.
p323_248|p323|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
p323_274|p323|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p323_260|p323|There is nothing sinister in it.
p323_328|p323|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p323_300|p323|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p323_314|p323|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p323_102|p323|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p323_116|p323|No passengers were on board.
p323_117|p323|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p323_103|p323|He could look after himself, but didn't.
p323_315|p323|All things are possible if you believe.
p323_301|p323|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p323_329|p323|I didn't know there was anything wrong.
p323_261|p323|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p323_275|p323|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p323_249|p323|People want to see me on the screen.
p323_063|p323|But it was a great decision he joked.
p323_077|p323|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p323_088|p323|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p323_049|p323|So, what's it about?
p323_061|p323|It is very difficult.
p323_075|p323|That is my personal view.
p323_288|p323|We need to increase the membership.
p323_263|p323|It is having a big impact.
p323_277|p323|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p323_317|p323|This was not just incongruous.
p323_303|p323|Detection is often difficult.
p323_129|p323|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p323_115|p323|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p323_101|p323|Club rugby refuses to die.
p323_100|p323|But he is something special, is he not?
p323_114|p323|We were a shambles at the back.
p323_128|p323|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
p323_302|p323|I first met him last summer.
p323_316|p323|The council's concern is very simple.
p323_276|p323|Scotland had great assets.
p323_262|p323|I've got to provide for my family.
p323_289|p323|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p323_074|p323|He's a joy to follow.
p323_060|p323|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p323_048|p323|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
p323_064|p323|Then they killed another three.
p323_070|p323|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p323_058|p323|We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
p323_299|p323|We were a little bit nervous.
p323_266|p323|I was not happy about being left out.
p323_272|p323|You do not change overnight.
p323_312|p323|I'm very puzzled by it.
p323_306|p323|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p323_110|p323|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p323_104|p323|The decision was designed to shock investors.
p323_138|p323|It's been a long, long journey.
p323_139|p323|I can give no comment.
p323_105|p323|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p323_111|p323|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p323_307|p323|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p323_313|p323|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p323_273|p323|We have to break that cycle.
p323_267|p323|Such debate is pointless.
p323_298|p323|Both were later released after a check-up.
p323_059|p323|It also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323_071|p323|The law has got to be upheld.
p323_065|p323|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p323_098|p323|They are not suitable.
p323_073|p323|I mean they have just been a disaster.
p323_067|p323|Most of the others were in their twenties.
p323_271|p323|It is not great art.
p323_265|p323|It's a very high number.
p323_259|p323|He said to me, Which one, son?
p323_305|p323|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p323_311|p323|This makes up for it.
p323_339|p323|Angola was a really hard place.
p323_107|p323|It's up to their parents to choose.
p323_113|p323|I have played really well all year.
p323_112|p323|It doesn't make them evil.
p323_106|p323|We are not dealing here with refugees.
p323_338|p323|We work on the same level.
p323_310|p323|The son has autism and other problems.
p323_304|p323|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p323_258|p323|The conversion didn't go over either.
p323_264|p323|That is very hard, alone.
p323_270|p323|What do you think of the hair?
p323_066|p323|The six others were injured.
p323_072|p323|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p323_099|p323|It does seem a mystery.
p323_029|p323|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
p323_015|p323|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p323_001|p323|Please call Stella.
p323_217|p323|I have no plans to change the oath.
p323_203|p323|There is no reason to put me out.
p323_388|p323|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p323_405|p323|The house was full of smoke.
p323_363|p323|I think she is supreme.
p323_377|p323|He asked how they were doing.
p323_411|p323|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p323_149|p323|I said, What does this mean?
p323_161|p323|That is our unfinished business.
p323_175|p323|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
p323_174|p323|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p323_160|p323|It's the best of both worlds.
p323_148|p323|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p323_376|p323|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p323_410|p323|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p323_404|p323|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p323_362|p323|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p323_389|p323|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p323_202|p323|She is not in a coma.
p323_216|p323|Lack of pace is his big problem.
p323_014|p323|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p323_028|p323|Now it is much easier.
p323_002|p323|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p323_016|p323|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p323_228|p323|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p323_200|p323|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p323_214|p323|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p323_348|p323|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p323_412|p323|Last night, the row continued.
p323_374|p323|The answer is mayhem.
p323_360|p323|This is a critical time for football.
p323_406|p323|A decision about that will be made today.
p323_189|p323|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p323_176|p323|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p323_162|p323|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p323_163|p323|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p323_177|p323|What do they do, anyway?
p323_188|p323|Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
p323_361|p323|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p323_407|p323|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p323_413|p323|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p323_375|p323|But the fans deserve to know!
p323_349|p323|There is no credible official announcement.
p323_215|p323|Is being naturally funny enough?
p323_201|p323|It has never been worthwhile.
p323_229|p323|That period was a struggle.
p323_017|p323|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p323_003|p323|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p323_007|p323|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p323_013|p323|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p323_205|p323|So other options had to be explored.
p323_211|p323|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p323_239|p323|My life would be a lot less restrictive.
p323_371|p323|The problem arises because he does so much.
p323_417|p323|It's been a humbling year.
p323_403|p323|We didn't make any of this up.
p323_365|p323|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p323_359|p323|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p323_198|p323|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p323_173|p323|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p323_167|p323|Nato has left them with no other option.
p323_166|p323|There are so many people to thank.
p323_172|p323|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p323_199|p323|It was an accounting error.
p323_358|p323|This is a United Kingdom.
p323_402|p323|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p323_364|p323|However, who could have predicted this result?
p323_370|p323|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p323_416|p323|There is a spring in the step.
p323_238|p323|Who can say?
p323_210|p323|People love to see this stuff.
p323_204|p323|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p323_012|p323|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p323_006|p323|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p323_010|p323|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p323_004|p323|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p323_038|p323|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323_212|p323|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p323_206|p323|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p323_399|p323|The racist abuse was terrible.
p323_366|p323|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p323_400|p323|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p323_414|p323|Now it's all written down.
p323_372|p323|This is totally out of character for Stuart.
p323_164|p323|But it was to no avail.
p323_170|p323|The stakes are high.
p323_158|p323|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p323_159|p323|I got off to a great start.
p323_171|p323|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p323_165|p323|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p323_415|p323|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
p323_373|p323|PR will be just one of them.
p323_367|p323|But we're not the same person.
p323_401|p323|Five officers were injured.
p323_398|p323|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p323_207|p323|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p323_213|p323|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p323_039|p323|And it had two seats.
p323_005|p323|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p323_011|p323|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p312_248|p312|I was proud of our lads.
p312_062|p312|The rest, of course, is history.
p312_076|p312|He was charged with perjury.
p312_089|p312|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p312_116|p312|I am not against a further inquiry.
p312_102|p312|They're just a nonsense.
p312_314|p312|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p312_300|p312|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p312_328|p312|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p312_329|p312|It's all happening at a local level.
p312_301|p312|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p312_315|p312|She has left the island.
p312_103|p312|There may be some resistance.
p312_117|p312|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312_088|p312|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p312_077|p312|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p312_063|p312|They chose the latter.
p312_249|p312|These will finally be corrected by next week.
p312_275|p312|The people here are quite reserved.
p312_261|p312|It was that bad, that low.
p312_277|p312|Our legal advice is clear.
p312_263|p312|His arrival could be the making of them.
p312_288|p312|That was the initial attraction.
p312_075|p312|Were they under-age?
p312_061|p312|It was a virus.
p312_049|p312|Back then it was hard to refuse.
p312_101|p312|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p312_115|p312|This looks like it's anything but open.
p312_129|p312|His remit is specific.
p312_303|p312|Destruction came from within.
p312_317|p312|Our system is archaic.
p312_316|p312|They had three children.
p312_302|p312|What makes a house a home?
p312_128|p312|The pain is still acute.
p312_114|p312|Where do you think she is going?
p312_100|p312|The plot is minimal.
p312_048|p312|The group will report back in the summer.
p312_060|p312|We just wish they had done so before.
p312_074|p312|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p312_289|p312|Who will take them after that?
p312_262|p312|That would be a big mistake.
p312_276|p312|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
p312_272|p312|I don't know what he was shouting.
p312_266|p312|You are a liar.
p312_299|p312|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p312_058|p312|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312_070|p312|The effect was almost magical.
p312_064|p312|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p312_138|p312|There was a definite prejudice.
p312_104|p312|I could not believe it.
p312_110|p312|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p312_306|p312|You can't do one without the other.
p312_312|p312|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p312_313|p312|And they did just that.
p312_307|p312|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312_111|p312|It's so much more fun.
p312_105|p312|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p312_139|p312|It's the same with us.
p312_065|p312|All were later allowed home.
p312_071|p312|It happened again, and again, and again.
p312_059|p312|The trust has no magic wand.
p312_298|p312|Bill is a mentor.
p312_267|p312|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p312_273|p312|It is the icing on the cake.
p312_259|p312|Who is he?
p312_265|p312|I said How much?
p312_271|p312|I'm not afraid of that.
p312_067|p312|I think it's more important to have fun.
p312_073|p312|I am still waiting for a reply.
p312_098|p312|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
p312_113|p312|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p312_107|p312|He will go a long way.
p312_339|p312|He had a horror.
p312_311|p312|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p312_305|p312|It is good to look back.
p312_304|p312|I think however, he was having a fit!
p312_310|p312|I would say so.
p312_338|p312|It's part of your life.
p312_106|p312|The Rangers think they have problems.
p312_112|p312|I believe he could have turned it around.
p312_099|p312|We could easily be cut again.
p312_072|p312|It showed him the way to drive.
p312_066|p312|Will you just put it away?
p312_270|p312|He finished the night in a cell.
p312_264|p312|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
p312_258|p312|The claim was denied by first minister.
p312_203|p312|That, he claimed, was essential.
p312_217|p312|Is it in the right place?
p312_015|p312|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p312_029|p312|Blood samples were taken.
p312_175|p312|They want this research to continue.
p312_161|p312|I think it's a sensible change.
p312_149|p312|I am so, so, so lucky.
p312_377|p312|The referee didn't do his job.
p312_411|p312|It was chaotic and frightening.
p312_405|p312|This is my big break.
p312_363|p312|He can do everything.
p312_388|p312|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p312_389|p312|That's an old idea.
p312_404|p312|If so, they were wrong.
p312_362|p312|We are in a learning curve.
p312_376|p312|Gordon Brown was superb.
p312_410|p312|He supported the decision to review the decision.
p312_148|p312|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
p312_160|p312|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p312_174|p312|I cannot say anymore.
p312_028|p312|He is doing the right things.
p312_014|p312|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p312_216|p312|There were no casualties.
p312_202|p312|I believe that the answer is simple.
p312_214|p312|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
p312_200|p312|Hear what they have to say.
p312_228|p312|It was no avail.
p312_016|p312|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p312_002|p312|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p312_162|p312|Sex is fun?
p312_176|p312|Robert is a special talent.
p312_189|p312|There is a lot of heroin about.
p312_360|p312|And Scotland is no different.
p312_406|p312|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p312_412|p312|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p312_374|p312|It's such a tragedy.
p312_348|p312|We told them in June.
p312_349|p312|Parents should avoid it.
p312_413|p312|He will never walk the streets again.
p312_375|p312|It was a long time coming.
p312_361|p312|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312_407|p312|There is no easy answer.
p312_188|p312|I probably would have been a dancer.
p312_177|p312|They are going to carry it through.
p312_163|p312|I'm not sure.
p312_003|p312|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p312_017|p312|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p312_229|p312|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p312_201|p312|Now there's a thought.
p312_215|p312|The dangers are very obvious.
p312_239|p312|I think it was his parents.
p312_211|p312|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p312_205|p312|They told him to go to drama school.
p312_013|p312|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p312_007|p312|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312_167|p312|It was visibly on fire.
p312_173|p312|This remains the party's policy.
p312_198|p312|It is a large number.
p312_359|p312|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p312_403|p312|No-one has yet been charged.
p312_365|p312|Is it a warning to parents?
p312_371|p312|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p312_417|p312|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p312_370|p312|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312_416|p312|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p312_402|p312|She died later on Monday.
p312_364|p312|She was just that sort of person.
p312_358|p312|It's just so sad.
p312_199|p312|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p312_172|p312|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p312_166|p312|And who would argue with that?
p312_006|p312|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p312_012|p312|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p312_204|p312|I was on the pitch and everything.
p312_210|p312|The next few months will tell.
p312_238|p312|This is a major step forward for carers.
p312_206|p312|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312_212|p312|But my daughter has got nothing.
p312_038|p312|This is really good news for us.
p312_004|p312|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p312_010|p312|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p312_158|p312|That says something for his strength of character.
p312_170|p312|A number of people could not speak English.
p312_164|p312|His first album was a hit.
p312_414|p312|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p312_372|p312|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p312_366|p312|You've gotten all the facts.
p312_400|p312|Do what you have to do.
p312_399|p312|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p312_398|p312|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p312_367|p312|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312_401|p312|We must do well in that.
p312_415|p312|Golf has lost a great character.
p312_373|p312|He said he needed no more evidence.
p312_165|p312|He had played well in that central role.
p312_171|p312|They have got off with murder.
p312_159|p312|The world is being invited to visit.
p312_011|p312|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p312_005|p312|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p312_039|p312|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p312_213|p312|You can see their point.
p312_207|p312|Let us hope so.
p312_222|p312|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312_236|p312|It will take place in July.
p312_020|p312|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312_034|p312|Well, you might have a point.
p312_008|p312|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p312_154|p312|Norman was not doing so bad, either.
p312_140|p312|It's an awful lot of money.
p312_168|p312|What's it for, after all?
p312_197|p312|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p312_183|p312|You're going to die.
p312_356|p312|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p312_342|p312|That was the biggest game of my life.
p312_418|p312|However, the report was incorrect.
p312_395|p312|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p312_381|p312|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p312_380|p312|Barry will be able to handle this.
p312_394|p312|We are keen to have him back.
p312_419|p312|There was no pressure at all.
p312_343|p312|This is perfectly legal.
p312_357|p312|It's better to be happy.
p312_182|p312|That's when the story first appeared.
p312_196|p312|He had a heart problem.
p312_169|p312|Who would be out there, singing?
p312_141|p312|He was the architect.
p312_155|p312|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p312_009|p312|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p312_035|p312|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p312_021|p312|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
p312_237|p312|We must not give in to the bastards.
p312_223|p312|He is a very nice man.
p312_235|p312|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p312_221|p312|I love you so very much.
p312_209|p312|Of course he was right!
p312_037|p312|That decision is now being appealed.
p312_023|p312|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p312_143|p312|It's a fantastic achievement.
p312_157|p312|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p312_180|p312|I think it can count against you now.
p312_194|p312|However, we came through.
p312_341|p312|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312_355|p312|He, too, is killing.
p312_369|p312|And huge, indeed, it is.
p312_382|p312|The urgency is real.
p312_396|p312|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
p312_397|p312|And we all understand that.
p312_383|p312|They have been for some time now.
p312_368|p312|Soon the whole country will be level.
p312_354|p312|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p312_340|p312|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312_195|p312|I love this tournament.
p312_181|p312|He was a legend.
p312_156|p312|It is almost certain to be the last.
p312_142|p312|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p312_022|p312|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p312_036|p312|Now the show is for public consumption.
p312_208|p312|She looked very settled.
p312_220|p312|They are still going to be impulsive.
p312_234|p312|It was worth the wait.
p312_218|p312|I played well in my time there.
p312_230|p312|He was replaced by John Spencer.
p312_224|p312|We want to sort it out.
p312_032|p312|We have a high quality product.
p312_026|p312|This was a rationing decision.
p312_146|p312|It's easy to see why.
p312_152|p312|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p312_185|p312|He will continue to provide support for them.
p312_191|p312|He never asked me for money.
p312_378|p312|We are very nearly there.
p312_344|p312|That's the most important thing for me.
p312_350|p312|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p312_387|p312|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p312_393|p312|We had no choice but to go down.
p312_392|p312|It's the whole season.
p312_386|p312|I've no passion for any country.
p312_351|p312|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p312_345|p312|Then came the second round.
p312_379|p312|Stand by for action.
p312_190|p312|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
p312_184|p312|There was a substantial explosion.
p312_153|p312|Where does it come from?
p312_147|p312|I've never regretted coming here.
p312_027|p312|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p312_033|p312|Haven't been so lucky since.
p312_225|p312|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p312_231|p312|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
p312_219|p312|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p312_227|p312|It made me determined to get back.
p312_233|p312|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p312_019|p312|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p312_025|p312|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p312_031|p312|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p312_179|p312|You can't keep them separate.
p312_151|p312|I fell into it by accident.
p312_145|p312|He, too, was not satisfied.
p312_192|p312|I was a bit nervous.
p312_186|p312|I'm going to see my friend.
p312_409|p312|I put pressure on him.
p312_353|p312|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p312_347|p312|Saddam is not threatening this country.
p312_390|p312|It is part and parcel of it.
p312_384|p312|It was only logical to end it.
p312_385|p312|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p312_391|p312|The only safe investment is cash.
p312_346|p312|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p312_352|p312|And she's not even in the book!
p312_408|p312|There was someone on the floor.
p312_187|p312|We played too deeply.
p312_193|p312|There was no question of him not impressing.
p312_144|p312|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p312_150|p312|We still have a long, long way to go.
p312_178|p312|It was very, very dejected.
p312_030|p312|I've got the poster.
p312_024|p312|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p312_018|p312|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p312_232|p312|That is in the very nature of farming.
p312_226|p312|Such a city does not exist.
p312_241|p312|Partly, it is his own fault.
p312_255|p312|It lasted longer than we thought.
p312_269|p312|She would say he was still the best.
p312_282|p312|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p312_296|p312|I was first in the door.
p312_043|p312|I think it must be the uniforms.
p312_057|p312|This is welcome news.
p312_080|p312|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_094|p312|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p312_137|p312|I was blown out of proportion.
p312_123|p312|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312_335|p312|The playing is perfectly turned out.
p312_321|p312|I wouldn't say this is normal.
p312_309|p312|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p312_308|p312|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
p312_320|p312|It is not illegal.
p312_334|p312|However, she is female, and so.
p312_122|p312|This latter suggestion is very important.
p312_136|p312|I am so upset.
p312_095|p312|It will be a challenging film.
p312_081|p312|We didn't take our chances.
p312_056|p312|My only concern is for my children.
p312_042|p312|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
p312_297|p312|It is highly unlikely.
p312_283|p312|We could do a lot worse.
p312_268|p312|We're still talking about it.
p312_254|p312|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312_240|p312|Our commitment is to move forward.
p312_256|p312|Promises were not kept.
p312_242|p312|It's a personal matter.
p312_295|p312|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p312_281|p312|They were totally behind it.
p312_054|p312|The children are being very brave.
p312_040|p312|Not so, it transpires.
p312_068|p312|Who did the recruiting?
p312_097|p312|What happens next?
p312_083|p312|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p312_120|p312|We are satisfied that this is the case.
p312_134|p312|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p312_108|p312|Then there was her childhood.
p312_322|p312|We don't have the credible evidence.
p312_336|p312|He will be advised by me.
p312_337|p312|But he did not rule out further talks.
p312_323|p312|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p312_109|p312|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p312_135|p312|But what lies ahead?
p312_121|p312|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p312_082|p312|It was all very proper and civilised.
p312_096|p312|The test case is still awaiting action.
p312_069|p312|It is still with Ministers.
p312_041|p312|I shouldn't have put up with it.
p312_055|p312|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p312_280|p312|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p312_294|p312|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p312_243|p312|That's where it all started.
p312_257|p312|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
p312_253|p312|He leaves a beat.
p312_247|p312|And does it?
p312_290|p312|He's also thinking long-term.
p312_284|p312|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p312_079|p312|The goal will come.
p312_051|p312|I was in the zone in the morning.
p312_045|p312|I certainly hope not.
p312_092|p312|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p312_086|p312|Action must be taken urgently.
p312_119|p312|What's the theme?
p312_125|p312|There was some merit in that.
p312_131|p312|Frustration is not the word.
p312_327|p312|There is still hope.
p312_332|p312|We do things in an appropriate way.
p312_326|p312|I don't want to use the term.
p312_130|p312|It is a very big problem.
p312_124|p312|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p312_118|p312|It's a double whammy.
p312_087|p312|I was brought up in a mining background.
p312_093|p312|They should be swept away.
p312_044|p312|This is not a monument to the past.
p312_050|p312|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p312_078|p312|However, there would be no permanent displays.
p312_285|p312|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312_291|p312|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p312_246|p312|You make the choice.
p312_252|p312|Was it a foul?
p312_278|p312|The past is history, not destiny.
p312_244|p312|I won't go back.
p312_250|p312|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p312_287|p312|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
p312_293|p312|It would also take time.
p312_046|p312|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p312_052|p312|We have to break that cycle.
p312_085|p312|That never seemed likely.
p312_091|p312|But these things are happening now.
p312_132|p312|The police have to act to help them.
p312_126|p312|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p312_318|p312|She had kept the news from him.
p312_330|p312|She is a great talent.
p312_324|p312|It's one up to the Scots.
p312_325|p312|This is complete nonsense.
p312_331|p312|It's the big omission.
p312_319|p312|We want to know about the policy.
p312_127|p312|What's wrong with that?
p312_133|p312|She was extremely rigid.
p312_090|p312|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312_084|p312|There are many children.
p312_053|p312|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
p312_047|p312|I feel pretty good.
p312_292|p312|Trevor has been great.
p312_286|p312|It is all one-sided.
p312_251|p312|All would be under threat.
p312_245|p312|Why has it taken so long?
p312_279|p312|These were the edited highlights.
p341_168|p341|Look at his last couple of records.
p341_183|p341|She is a very lucky lady.
p341_197|p341|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p341_342|p341|We are very nearly there.
p341_356|p341|She had every right to read the warrant.
p341_381|p341|They have learned from that.
p341_395|p341|However, this idea is never developed.
p341_236|p341|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p341_222|p341|It is all one-sided.
p341_034|p341|It's easy to see why.
p341_020|p341|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p341_008|p341|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p341_009|p341|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p341_021|p341|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p341_035|p341|I am proud of moments like that.
p341_223|p341|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p341_237|p341|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p341_394|p341|Maybe, who knows?
p341_380|p341|We cannot lose it.
p341_357|p341|This is normal for him now.
p341_343|p341|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p341_196|p341|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p341_182|p341|Nobody ever knew it had happened.
p341_169|p341|I am still very much a director.
p341_155|p341|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p341_141|p341|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p341_157|p341|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341_143|p341|I love you so very much.
p341_194|p341|No such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341_180|p341|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p341_355|p341|I have not been so angry for years.
p341_341|p341|If there is default.
p341_369|p341|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p341_396|p341|But it is all by design.
p341_382|p341|We have been working together for some years.
p341_221|p341|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p341_209|p341|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p341_023|p341|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341_037|p341|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p341_036|p341|That was no surprise to me.
p341_022|p341|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p341_208|p341|Too much has already been said.
p341_234|p341|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p341_220|p341|I just could not cope.
p341_383|p341|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p341_397|p341|It was a sell-out.
p341_368|p341|I don't have a new house.
p341_340|p341|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p341_354|p341|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p341_181|p341|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p341_195|p341|Felt good about it.
p341_142|p341|They are still going to be impulsive.
p341_156|p341|It was to no avail.
p341_152|p341|Such a city does not exist.
p341_146|p341|Their condition was described as stable.
p341_191|p341|You can feel at home in China.
p341_185|p341|We've been there for seven years.
p341_378|p341|And it's not funny.
p341_350|p341|He takes time out for everyone.
p341_344|p341|We have to go for it.
p341_393|p341|Story time is over - it's a war.
p341_387|p341|No-one has yet been charged.
p341_218|p341|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p341_224|p341|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p341_230|p341|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
p341_026|p341|That's interesting to me.
p341_032|p341|It has moved on in the last week.
p341_033|p341|Everything was up for grabs.
p341_027|p341|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p341_231|p341|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p341_225|p341|Here are some possible solutions.
p341_219|p341|I am totally devoted to this job.
p341_386|p341|That gave us some confidence.
p341_392|p341|There was someone on the floor.
p341_345|p341|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p341_351|p341|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p341_379|p341|I didn't do too badly myself.
p341_184|p341|It's the whole season.
p341_190|p341|We are on the path of change.
p341_147|p341|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p341_153|p341|My aim is a top six finish.
p341_179|p341|And does it?
p341_145|p341|The road was closed for several hours.
p341_151|p341|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p341_186|p341|Promises were not kept.
p341_192|p341|Who is he?
p341_409|p341|He needs to be.
p341_347|p341|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341_353|p341|I can't stop people thinking.
p341_384|p341|We only lost the third goal.
p341_390|p341|Then came the second round.
p341_233|p341|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p341_227|p341|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p341_019|p341|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p341_031|p341|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p341_025|p341|This guy is never going to give up.
p341_024|p341|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p341_030|p341|Gilbert was not amused.
p341_018|p341|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p341_226|p341|That's the day job.
p341_232|p341|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p341_391|p341|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p341_385|p341|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p341_352|p341|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p341_346|p341|Barry will be able to handle this.
p341_408|p341|Women reported more depression than men.
p341_193|p341|It has to be a long-term commitment.
p341_187|p341|His signature is his handwriting.
p341_150|p341|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p341_144|p341|He is a very nice man.
p341_178|p341|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p341_123|p341|The lady is right.
p341_137|p341|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p341_321|p341|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p341_335|p341|He said he needed no more evidence.
p341_309|p341|They were the better side on the day.
p341_255|p341|Do not listen to them.
p341_241|p341|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p341_269|p341|It's one up to the Scots.
p341_296|p341|They too refused to come out and talk.
p341_282|p341|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p341_057|p341|So the process was refined.
p341_043|p341|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341_094|p341|We are losing this war.
p341_080|p341|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p341_081|p341|Robert is a special talent.
p341_095|p341|It's a difficult one to play.
p341_042|p341|I fell into it by accident.
p341_056|p341|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p341_283|p341|Are you in this movie?
p341_297|p341|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p341_268|p341|We don't have the credible evidence.
p341_240|p341|Bill is a mentor.
p341_254|p341|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p341_308|p341|We have to adapt to this level.
p341_334|p341|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
p341_320|p341|He was released in March this year.
p341_136|p341|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p341_122|p341|He had other things on his mind.
p341_134|p341|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p341_120|p341|The choice is strictly personal.
p341_108|p341|I was a bit nervous.
p341_336|p341|People might not actually want the job.
p341_322|p341|I stayed away from the defence.
p341_242|p341|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p341_256|p341|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p341_281|p341|The manager knew me very well.
p341_295|p341|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p341_040|p341|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341_054|p341|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p341_068|p341|Where is the human rights?
p341_083|p341|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p341_097|p341|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p341_096|p341|The death rates are still as high.
p341_082|p341|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p341_069|p341|We must put a marker down.
p341_055|p341|I've just got to do this.
p341_041|p341|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p341_294|p341|You've got it coming Kabul.
p341_280|p341|I hope my successor will do the same.
p341_257|p341|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p341_243|p341|One must hope not!
p341_323|p341|We do need to get the message across.
p341_337|p341|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p341_109|p341|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p341_121|p341|We are going to go about our lives.
p341_135|p341|Yet he chose to do something different.
p341_119|p341|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p341_131|p341|You can see their point.
p341_125|p341|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p341_333|p341|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p341_327|p341|It was chaotic and frightening.
p341_247|p341|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p341_253|p341|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p341_284|p341|We've got a full house tonight.
p341_290|p341|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p341_079|p341|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p341_045|p341|Her daughter is getting married.
p341_051|p341|We are going for it.
p341_086|p341|You can't keep them separate.
p341_092|p341|Israel has done very little until now.
p341_093|p341|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p341_087|p341|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p341_050|p341|That says something for his strength of character.
p341_044|p341|This is a big advantage.
p341_078|p341|It does not stop at the border.
p341_291|p341|It was just one of those things.
p341_285|p341|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
p341_252|p341|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p341_246|p341|I think however, he was having a fit!
p341_326|p341|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p341_332|p341|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p341_124|p341|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p341_130|p341|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p341_118|p341|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p341_126|p341|The next few months will tell.
p341_132|p341|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p341_318|p341|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p341_324|p341|Instead, she just went away.
p341_330|p341|And huge, indeed, it is.
p341_278|p341|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p341_250|p341|I'll go back home and see my family.
p341_244|p341|It was a big day.
p341_293|p341|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p341_287|p341|Make sure you see it.
p341_052|p341|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p341_046|p341|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p341_091|p341|It had a gigantic effect.
p341_085|p341|She added, It is a huge problem.
p341_084|p341|They are going to carry it through.
p341_090|p341|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p341_047|p341|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p341_053|p341|It's to do with play.
p341_286|p341|The fans will support us.
p341_292|p341|The whole team was rubbish.
p341_245|p341|What makes a house a home?
p341_251|p341|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p341_279|p341|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p341_331|p341|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p341_325|p341|That did not go down well.
p341_319|p341|This is very bad news.
p341_133|p341|There was no hint of bravado.
p341_127|p341|I'm so proud of my team.
p341_102|p341|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p341_116|p341|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p341_300|p341|It's a source of deep concern.
p341_314|p341|No-one thought about this.
p341_328|p341|It is a question of balance.
p341_274|p341|So there's a double whammy.
p341_260|p341|It was a tactical change.
p341_248|p341|I will not be pressured.
p341_076|p341|But there was a shift.
p341_062|p341|They were not doing it too well, either.
p341_089|p341|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p341_088|p341|I still feel like a wee boy.
p341_063|p341|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p341_077|p341|The settlement could run to millions.
p341_249|p341|It doesn't make sense.
p341_261|p341|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p341_275|p341|I didn't have a trio.
p341_329|p341|Soon the whole country will be level.
p341_315|p341|We're all in a state of shock.
p341_301|p341|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p341_117|p341|Both managements are very supportive.
p341_103|p341|People buy everything with cash.
p341_115|p341|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p341_101|p341|That meant the search was unlawful.
p341_129|p341|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p341_317|p341|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p341_303|p341|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p341_263|p341|This time, there were no such rewards.
p341_277|p341|That is a mark of what you are.
p341_288|p341|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p341_061|p341|Sex is fun?
p341_075|p341|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p341_049|p341|Today is not about contracts.
p341_048|p341|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p341_074|p341|The feeling is awesome.
p341_060|p341|I think it is a sensible change.
p341_289|p341|We are aware of the two incidents.
p341_276|p341|Their three other children had died as infants.
p341_262|p341|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p341_302|p341|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p341_316|p341|I thought he was part of the camera.
p341_128|p341|It is crucial for both teams.
p341_100|p341|I don't think it could be clearer.
p341_114|p341|He had a heart problem.
p341_138|p341|There were no casualties.
p341_110|p341|It was love of Helen and the children.
p341_104|p341|We are trying to establish a date.
p341_312|p341|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p341_306|p341|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p341_266|p341|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p341_272|p341|Also, he was flawed.
p341_299|p341|That was enough for the committee.
p341_058|p341|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p341_064|p341|This is the crossroads.
p341_070|p341|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341_071|p341|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p341_065|p341|He had played well in that central role.
p341_059|p341|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p341_298|p341|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p341_273|p341|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p341_267|p341|She became very good at it.
p341_307|p341|The Dow Jones is way up.
p341_313|p341|Calderwood would agree with that.
p341_105|p341|He is a law unto himself.
p341_111|p341|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p341_139|p341|The case will now go to appeal.
p341_107|p341|There was great support all round the route.
p341_113|p341|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p341_339|p341|They told us about it the next day.
p341_305|p341|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p341_311|p341|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p341_259|p341|Our system is archaic.
p341_271|p341|And we still have to pay his salary.
p341_265|p341|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p341_073|p341|They had had time for little else.
p341_067|p341|And who would argue with that?
p341_098|p341|It is a great honour and a privilege.
p341_099|p341|We certainly will need to watch him.
p341_066|p341|He is pretty upset.
p341_072|p341|It is time to give her a rest.
p341_264|p341|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
p341_270|p341|I'm just doing artwork.
p341_258|p341|He loves the big occasions.
p341_310|p341|What are you going to do exactly?
p341_304|p341|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p341_338|p341|It broke up my marriage.
p341_112|p341|I love this tournament.
p341_106|p341|The website is now being amended.
p341_161|p341|These matters are now behind us.
p341_175|p341|Of course he is.
p341_149|p341|I had a tie in my hand.
p341_405|p341|You have to have some hope and faith.
p341_363|p341|The place became a war zone.
p341_377|p341|One policeman was killed.
p341_388|p341|Such people do not exist.
p341_217|p341|I'm a bit annoyed.
p341_203|p341|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p341_015|p341|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p341_001|p341|Please call Stella.
p341_029|p341|The injuries are not too serious.
p341_028|p341|It is only one night, after all.
p341_014|p341|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p341_202|p341|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p341_216|p341|It didn't get any better.
p341_389|p341|Is this new report the answer?
p341_376|p341|And we all understand that.
p341_410|p341|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p341_404|p341|Golf has lost a great character.
p341_362|p341|Scotland is losing business.
p341_148|p341|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p341_174|p341|They will know they deserve to be there.
p341_160|p341|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
p341_176|p341|This is a very positive step forward.
p341_162|p341|I'm working on that.
p341_189|p341|I've already done that.
p341_374|p341|See it while you can.
p341_360|p341|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p341_406|p341|They hold on for many years.
p341_348|p341|The urgency is real.
p341_200|p341|One season, they might do well.
p341_214|p341|The budget was too low for that.
p341_228|p341|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p341_002|p341|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p341_016|p341|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p341_017|p341|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p341_003|p341|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p341_229|p341|I'm not saying he is finished.
p341_215|p341|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p341_201|p341|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p341_349|p341|I've already got them in.
p341_361|p341|That's an old idea.
p341_407|p341|However, the report was incorrect.
p341_375|p341|Folk music is in her blood.
p341_188|p341|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p341_163|p341|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p341_177|p341|This is a huge confidence boost.
p341_173|p341|My house was shaking at the time.
p341_167|p341|It really is a gift to the world.
p341_198|p341|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341_359|p341|There is too much at stake for that.
p341_371|p341|You are a liar.
p341_403|p341|She will just have wanted her baby.
p341_365|p341|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p341_239|p341|I lost it at the final whistle.
p341_205|p341|I feel privileged to be here.
p341_211|p341|I think the Government should pay for that.
p341_007|p341|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p341_013|p341|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p341_012|p341|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p341_006|p341|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p341_210|p341|He explained to his audience.
p341_204|p341|It's up to their parents to choose.
p341_238|p341|We believe we have a strong case.
p341_402|p341|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p341_364|p341|What's happening to her?
p341_370|p341|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341_358|p341|Nothing was going to go right.
p341_199|p341|What's the big idea?
p341_166|p341|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p341_172|p341|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p341_158|p341|But my heart is in athletics.
p341_164|p341|It was then into overtime.
p341_170|p341|We must not give in to bastards.
p341_366|p341|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p341_400|p341|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p341_372|p341|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p341_399|p341|Things are going very well.
p341_212|p341|I asked why he had come.
p341_206|p341|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p341_038|p341|There is no escape.
p341_010|p341|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p341_004|p341|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p341_005|p341|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p341_011|p341|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p341_039|p341|It's wonderful to have won.
p341_207|p341|She told me to apply for the crest.
p341_213|p341|He was a soldier.
p341_398|p341|We've still got a say in this.
p341_373|p341|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p341_367|p341|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p341_401|p341|I'll take what comes along.
p341_171|p341|She may even appear in some more films.
p341_165|p341|Most of the public are behind me.
p341_159|p341|That is in the very nature of farming.
p314_219|p314|That it is a brand name.
p314_033|p314|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p314_027|p314|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p314_184|p314|There is no way to do this.
p314_190|p314|No, it's never been mentioned.
p314_147|p314|There is no such thing.
p314_153|p314|We like being the underdogs.
p314_386|p314|I can't believe what has happened.
p314_392|p314|We've been treated with complete contempt.
p314_345|p314|With us, we just want them to respond.
p314_423|p314|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p314_351|p314|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p314_379|p314|There were three boys and two girls.
p314_378|p314|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p314_350|p314|This seems like a very good idea.
p314_344|p314|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p314_422|p314|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p314_393|p314|There must be boundaries.
p314_387|p314|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p314_152|p314|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p314_146|p314|Now we look forward to it.
p314_191|p314|They had been together for about three years.
p314_185|p314|It was an empowering journey.
p314_026|p314|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p314_032|p314|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p314_218|p314|I'd come back from London.
p314_224|p314|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p314_230|p314|It is a court case.
p314_226|p314|That is not an easy thing.
p314_232|p314|The next one comes up.
p314_024|p314|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p314_030|p314|I believe in the Church.
p314_018|p314|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p314_193|p314|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p314_187|p314|I certainly do not agree with that.
p314_150|p314|It was a moment of madness.
p314_144|p314|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p314_178|p314|It's just a normal life.
p314_391|p314|Partition is not an option.
p314_385|p314|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p314_352|p314|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p314_420|p314|My thoughts are with their families.
p314_346|p314|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p314_408|p314|There is no smoking gun.
p314_409|p314|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p314_421|p314|He is not very big, either.
p314_347|p314|They are the heroes.
p314_353|p314|It took more than two years.
p314_384|p314|I am not obsessed with sex.
p314_390|p314|It was early morning.
p314_179|p314|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p314_145|p314|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p314_151|p314|Don't even bother applying.
p314_186|p314|Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
p314_192|p314|O Neill has delivered.
p314_019|p314|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p314_031|p314|We are just being flooded.
p314_025|p314|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p314_233|p314|This fact is supported by audience research.
p314_227|p314|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p314_223|p314|We don't say there was a massacre.
p314_237|p314|This is wonderful news.
p314_009|p314|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p314_021|p314|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p314_035|p314|Well, what do you know?
p314_196|p314|We will reform the welfare state.
p314_182|p314|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p314_169|p314|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p314_155|p314|But we are not immune to the problem.
p314_141|p314|This is the high point of my career.
p314_394|p314|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p314_380|p314|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p314_419|p314|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p314_357|p314|I like what has happened!
p314_343|p314|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p314_342|p314|His job was not advertised.
p314_356|p314|We don't want to push him.
p314_418|p314|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p314_381|p314|He had no answer.
p314_395|p314|The home team had an amazing start.
p314_140|p314|I would love it.
p314_154|p314|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p314_168|p314|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p314_183|p314|He is the example for all of us.
p314_197|p314|It may be his last for a while, too.
p314_034|p314|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p314_020|p314|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p314_008|p314|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p314_236|p314|Both sides have to step back.
p314_222|p314|They should come forward.
p314_208|p314|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p314_234|p314|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p314_220|p314|She was an only child.
p314_036|p314|But she was very human.
p314_022|p314|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p314_181|p314|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p314_195|p314|Our customers come first.
p314_142|p314|That's the sort of game you want.
p314_156|p314|Racism has no place in any sport.
p314_383|p314|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p314_397|p314|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p314_368|p314|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p314_340|p314|However, we had no failures on our side.
p314_354|p314|There is access for disabled people.
p314_355|p314|The home was now under new management.
p314_341|p314|She had been sexually assaulted.
p314_369|p314|It looks like paradise.
p314_396|p314|We can make changes.
p314_382|p314|There is a job to be done.
p314_157|p314|It's all too short term.
p314_143|p314|My duty is to win.
p314_194|p314|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p314_180|p314|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p314_023|p314|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p314_037|p314|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p314_221|p314|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p314_235|p314|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p314_209|p314|You saw the football.
p314_291|p314|There is great demand for human cloning.
p314_285|p314|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p314_252|p314|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
p314_246|p314|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p314_093|p314|Action must be taken urgently.
p314_087|p314|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p314_050|p314|We have no choice but to shut down.
p314_044|p314|In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
p314_078|p314|What did we learn?
p314_124|p314|There are a lot of examples.
p314_130|p314|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p314_118|p314|He would just say it was terrible.
p314_326|p314|He will address the nation this evening.
p314_332|p314|No, no, it's not what you think.
p314_333|p314|This is a national crisis.
p314_327|p314|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p314_119|p314|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p314_131|p314|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p314_125|p314|But it will backfire.
p314_079|p314|I go home only once.
p314_045|p314|He will emerge as a world leader.
p314_051|p314|I'm feeling pretty good.
p314_086|p314|The team this year is going places.
p314_092|p314|He said because people had invited him.
p314_247|p314|The death toll included five children.
p314_253|p314|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p314_284|p314|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p314_290|p314|That is highly unfair.
p314_286|p314|Some may end up in hospital.
p314_292|p314|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p314_245|p314|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p314_251|p314|You cannot allow it to go on.
p314_279|p314|It could be a danger.
p314_084|p314|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p314_090|p314|He has changed my life for ever.
p314_047|p314|I only half believe it.
p314_053|p314|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p314_133|p314|The final stage is paranoia.
p314_127|p314|I really hope he thinks that through.
p314_331|p314|You have to think not.
p314_325|p314|Dialogue is the key.
p314_319|p314|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p314_318|p314|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p314_324|p314|I'll tell you honestly.
p314_330|p314|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p314_126|p314|But then he changed his mind.
p314_132|p314|That's a huge amount.
p314_052|p314|The prognosis is excellent.
p314_046|p314|That view has not altered.
p314_091|p314|It plans to return to this field.
p314_085|p314|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p314_278|p314|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p314_250|p314|And what is she escaping from?
p314_244|p314|I don't have any answer for them.
p314_293|p314|I am just trying to do my job.
p314_287|p314|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p314_283|p314|Nothing can bring back their son.
p314_297|p314|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p314_268|p314|I took a minibus into town.
p314_240|p314|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p314_254|p314|A friendship that will endure.
p314_081|p314|It had a gigantic effect.
p314_095|p314|The money is not really our concern.
p314_042|p314|It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
p314_056|p314|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p314_136|p314|Folk music is in her blood.
p314_122|p314|But the killer remains at large.
p314_308|p314|A counter reaction was.
p314_334|p314|Scotland were beaten again.
p314_320|p314|I am not among its admirers.
p314_321|p314|Hitches can be expected.
p314_335|p314|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p314_309|p314|He said he was sorry.
p314_123|p314|It is a great shame.
p314_137|p314|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p314_057|p314|It is not normal practice.
p314_043|p314|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p314_094|p314|They are completely different from each other.
p314_080|p314|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p314_255|p314|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p314_241|p314|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p314_269|p314|They've been at it for five hours.
p314_296|p314|What are you going to do exactly?
p314_282|p314|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p314_294|p314|I don't think we could have expected better.
p314_280|p314|This is my home town.
p314_257|p314|That will not change.
p314_243|p314|I was just getting over the time difference.
p314_096|p314|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p314_082|p314|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p314_069|p314|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p314_055|p314|It was developed in the Gulf War.
p314_041|p314|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p314_109|p314|That is nearly four people every day.
p314_121|p314|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p314_135|p314|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p314_323|p314|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p314_337|p314|The whole thing would be perfect.
p314_336|p314|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p314_322|p314|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p314_134|p314|I'm not holding the club to ransom.
p314_120|p314|That's not fair to the supporters.
p314_108|p314|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p314_040|p314|We have reacted well to each other.
p314_054|p314|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p314_068|p314|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p314_083|p314|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p314_097|p314|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p314_242|p314|We are ready for the long haul.
p314_256|p314|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p314_281|p314|His English counterpart agreed.
p314_295|p314|You take a risk.
p314_298|p314|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p314_273|p314|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p314_267|p314|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p314_071|p314|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p314_065|p314|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p314_059|p314|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p314_105|p314|That would be even more disastrous.
p314_111|p314|Is my wife a racist?
p314_139|p314|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p314_307|p314|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p314_313|p314|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p314_312|p314|That only came out during a radio interview.
p314_306|p314|This is too much like Scotland.
p314_138|p314|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p314_110|p314|There are nine people here now.
p314_104|p314|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p314_058|p314|But he just carried on anyway.
p314_064|p314|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p314_070|p314|These findings would be made public.
p314_266|p314|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p314_272|p314|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p314_299|p314|I just want to change my life.
p314_264|p314|He is young but not too young.
p314_270|p314|I'm not talking about his career.
p314_258|p314|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p314_099|p314|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p314_066|p314|They were later discharged from hospital.
p314_072|p314|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p314_112|p314|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p314_106|p314|These guys will not lie down.
p314_310|p314|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p314_304|p314|This club have been fair to me.
p314_338|p314|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p314_339|p314|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p314_305|p314|He knew it would cost him millions.
p314_311|p314|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
p314_107|p314|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p314_113|p314|This would not be my first choice.
p314_073|p314|You can't go on forever.
p314_067|p314|Let's see that increase over the years.
p314_098|p314|I came up through the ranks.
p314_259|p314|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p314_271|p314|I watched a game.
p314_265|p314|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p314_249|p314|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p314_261|p314|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p314_275|p314|He has lost confidence and weight.
p314_088|p314|We should do everything at a stroke.
p314_063|p314|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314_077|p314|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p314_117|p314|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p314_103|p314|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p314_329|p314|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p314_315|p314|We are now setting about finding them.
p314_301|p314|Check that he is dead.
p314_300|p314|A statement is expected in April.
p314_314|p314|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p314_328|p314|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p314_102|p314|The proposal was rejected.
p314_116|p314|Which perhaps is just as well.
p314_076|p314|I have got a knife.
p314_062|p314|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p314_089|p314|He had a moustache.
p314_274|p314|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p314_260|p314|I am deeply sorry they did.
p314_248|p314|EMI is a prime example.
p314_289|p314|I'm not putting myself down.
p314_276|p314|Intensive care has been very busy.
p314_262|p314|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p314_048|p314|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p314_074|p314|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p314_060|p314|What happens next?
p314_128|p314|Police were also perplexed.
p314_100|p314|His team management was protective.
p314_114|p314|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p314_302|p314|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p314_316|p314|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p314_317|p314|Neither was involved in violence.
p314_303|p314|He is also a great finisher.
p314_115|p314|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p314_101|p314|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p314_129|p314|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p314_061|p314|I would not want to be young again.
p314_075|p314|So far this season this approach is working.
p314_049|p314|All the oil companies are talking together.
p314_263|p314|Who would have thought it?
p314_277|p314|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p314_288|p314|The alliance said it may not wait.
p314_210|p314|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p314_204|p314|Drugs are getting through.
p314_238|p314|Is he going to look after them?
p314_012|p314|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p314_006|p314|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p314_199|p314|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
p314_166|p314|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p314_172|p314|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p314_364|p314|Now it has become a big picture.
p314_402|p314|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p314_416|p314|I am in a very difficult position.
p314_370|p314|This means a great deal to the families.
p314_358|p314|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p314_359|p314|One was a lawyer.
p314_417|p314|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p314_371|p314|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p314_365|p314|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p314_403|p314|Friends of the family have given their support.
p314_173|p314|We've got the top three.
p314_167|p314|Little Voice is on general release.
p314_198|p314|His director of football is leaving.
p314_007|p314|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p314_013|p314|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p314_239|p314|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p314_205|p314|Do you come from Moscow?
p314_211|p314|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p314_207|p314|That night was a terrible muddle.
p314_213|p314|I am a little bit tired.
p314_005|p314|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p314_011|p314|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p314_039|p314|His concern is only for the future.
p314_171|p314|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p314_165|p314|I should not be able to stand.
p314_159|p314|We must move on.
p314_398|p314|The conclusion is enthralling.
p314_373|p314|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p314_415|p314|Jackson may well be right.
p314_401|p314|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p314_367|p314|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p314_400|p314|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p314_366|p314|But let's not get carried away.
p314_372|p314|We were short of athletes.
p314_414|p314|I don't believe that money is the answer.
p314_399|p314|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p314_158|p314|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p314_164|p314|The elections should have no role in this.
p314_170|p314|They've got to get better.
p314_038|p314|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p314_010|p314|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p314_004|p314|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p314_212|p314|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p314_206|p314|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p314_202|p314|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p314_216|p314|I looked forward to it.
p314_028|p314|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p314_014|p314|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p314_148|p314|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p314_174|p314|I was never alone with her, right?
p314_160|p314|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p314_389|p314|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p314_410|p314|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
p314_376|p314|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p314_362|p314|It's being very carefully looked at.
p314_404|p314|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p314_363|p314|It was a job he loved.
p314_405|p314|You name it, they have it.
p314_411|p314|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p314_377|p314|Only local people are helping.
p314_388|p314|You do that because you want to win.
p314_161|p314|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p314_175|p314|There is no substitute.
p314_149|p314|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p314_015|p314|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p314_001|p314|Please call Stella.
p314_029|p314|Four other charges were dropped.
p314_217|p314|That was a disgraceful performance.
p314_203|p314|We just want to get stuck in now.
p314_229|p314|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p314_215|p314|We have an attorney on the ground.
p314_201|p314|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p314_017|p314|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p314_003|p314|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p314_188|p314|It was a disaster of a race.
p314_163|p314|I'd say we should give it a week.
p314_177|p314|This will secure the future of our industry.
p314_349|p314|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p314_407|p314|The review has been conducted fairly.
p314_361|p314|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p314_375|p314|We want to keep the pound.
p314_413|p314|Whether this return was too soon.
p314_374|p314|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
p314_412|p314|It is a natural reaction.
p314_406|p314|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p314_360|p314|There is no openness.
p314_348|p314|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p314_176|p314|That nation is South Africa.
p314_162|p314|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p314_189|p314|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p314_002|p314|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p314_016|p314|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p314_200|p314|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p314_214|p314|Broke the birdie record.
p314_228|p314|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p313_098|p313|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p313_271|p313|I expect a rapid response.
p313_265|p313|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p313_259|p313|Perhaps we should do the same.
p313_305|p313|SO now we know the secret.
p313_311|p313|Could you put it in writing?
p313_339|p313|I can't believe the buzz.
p313_107|p313|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p313_113|p313|We played so well at times.
p313_112|p313|A web site is planned for November.
p313_106|p313|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p313_310|p313|And we've beaten them before.
p313_304|p313|I'm not a fan of books.
p313_258|p313|Or so everyone believed.
p313_264|p313|We are playing them at their own game.
p313_270|p313|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p313_099|p313|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p313_066|p313|He got his degree.
p313_072|p313|Before the games it was pretty open.
p313_064|p313|I learned a lot from that.
p313_070|p313|I'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313_058|p313|In a way he was.
p313_266|p313|I had trouble with the producers.
p313_272|p313|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p313_299|p313|The incident is being taken seriously.
p313_312|p313|I'm not a paedophile.
p313_306|p313|It may well have been.
p313_110|p313|I took the gun.
p313_104|p313|We shall be victorious.
p313_138|p313|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p313_139|p313|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p313_105|p313|The quality of work is very impressive.
p313_111|p313|It's just one of those things.
p313_307|p313|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p313_313|p313|Some of their movement was excellent.
p313_298|p313|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p313_273|p313|There is no more money.
p313_267|p313|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p313_059|p313|It's back to how it used to be.
p313_071|p313|There were no formal announcements.
p313_065|p313|The house was so well alight.
p313_049|p313|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p313_061|p313|The firm was down and almost out.
p313_075|p313|I'm so worried about the roads.
p313_263|p313|It's up to Ann.
p313_277|p313|It's an absolute disgrace.
p313_288|p313|We have it on video.
p313_317|p313|They deserve a lot of credit.
p313_303|p313|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p313_129|p313|Raymond was always on the outside.
p313_115|p313|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p313_101|p313|This is my personal assessment.
p313_100|p313|They've just got to believe in themselves.
p313_114|p313|I was very fortunate.
p313_128|p313|What has changed since then?
p313_302|p313|I can feel the sound inside.
p313_316|p313|But then they scored their fourth.
p313_289|p313|I'm not a threat to coaches.
p313_276|p313|There have been different reports from different people.
p313_262|p313|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p313_074|p313|But you can go beyond that condition.
p313_060|p313|It is not a standing army.
p313_048|p313|We were very much a happy family.
p313_076|p313|This was much worse.
p313_062|p313|They said they were only young men.
p313_089|p313|This gives us a lot of practice.
p313_248|p313|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p313_274|p313|My mother is a widow.
p313_260|p313|I read it every year.
p313_328|p313|It went on to become an annual event.
p313_300|p313|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p313_314|p313|But they had to be paid for.
p313_102|p313|There was no trouble at all.
p313_116|p313|We act because we must.
p313_117|p313|They will be destroyed.
p313_103|p313|Although, you never know.
p313_315|p313|The odds are that it will.
p313_301|p313|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p313_329|p313|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p313_261|p313|He was in contention almost every week.
p313_275|p313|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p313_249|p313|We should be rewarded for producing.
p313_088|p313|This could be her way forward.
p313_063|p313|I was chosen to do this.
p313_077|p313|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p313_010|p313|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p313_004|p313|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p313_038|p313|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p313_212|p313|But there's no eye contact.
p313_206|p313|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p313_400|p313|His primary residence is Scotland.
p313_366|p313|The idea was presented to me.
p313_372|p313|This was not a summit about the euro.
p313_414|p313|We never agreed to it.
p313_399|p313|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p313_164|p313|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p313_170|p313|There is a simmering anger out there.
p313_158|p313|Who was on the panel?
p313_159|p313|They may differ on other issues.
p313_171|p313|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p313_165|p313|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p313_398|p313|He says it often enough.
p313_373|p313|Frank Warren is a great man.
p313_415|p313|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p313_401|p313|I found that much more challenging.
p313_367|p313|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p313_207|p313|There are moments of honesty, too.
p313_213|p313|The squad will be the same for France.
p313_039|p313|It helped me to get noticed.
p313_005|p313|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p313_011|p313|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p313_007|p313|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p313_013|p313|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p313_205|p313|So she told him.
p313_211|p313|I suspect that it will.
p313_239|p313|I was an athlete.
p313_417|p313|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p313_371|p313|I see it as my job.
p313_365|p313|They took a risk.
p313_403|p313|It would have been very easily done.
p313_359|p313|The hotel was huge.
p313_173|p313|The stadium was full.
p313_167|p313|It will not be easy for him.
p313_198|p313|This is a really serious issue.
p313_199|p313|So they will settle again.
p313_166|p313|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p313_172|p313|That is not a position they enjoy.
p313_358|p313|Closure is not one of them.
p313_364|p313|I'm amazed at what he's done.
p313_402|p313|This fight is not going to go away.
p313_416|p313|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p313_370|p313|The hearing was fair.
p313_238|p313|There is nothing to fear.
p313_210|p313|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p313_204|p313|Election results are expected soon.
p313_012|p313|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p313_006|p313|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p313_002|p313|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p313_016|p313|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p313_228|p313|And then a funny thing happened.
p313_200|p313|How do we get more people in?
p313_214|p313|We are a party for people, not against people.
p313_348|p313|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p313_374|p313|I'm a little bit tired.
p313_412|p313|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p313_406|p313|It's going to be a new challenge.
p313_360|p313|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p313_176|p313|It is very much a matter for them.
p313_162|p313|The General Election is all to play for.
p313_189|p313|They were that poor.
p313_188|p313|His manager blamed the referee.
p313_163|p313|It was a fiery game.
p313_177|p313|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p313_407|p313|As, indeed, they would be.
p313_361|p313|Well, you can have a tree.
p313_375|p313|That was never their agenda.
p313_413|p313|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p313_349|p313|It's been handled entirely properly.
p313_215|p313|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p313_201|p313|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p313_229|p313|It doesn't take much.
p313_017|p313|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p313_003|p313|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p313_029|p313|However, it's good to turn the page.
p313_015|p313|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p313_001|p313|Please call Stella.
p313_217|p313|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p313_203|p313|This is not a European Army.
p313_363|p313|This is an internal matter.
p313_405|p313|The Open champion is back.
p313_411|p313|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p313_377|p313|She's currently in foster care.
p313_388|p313|I was released after six days.
p313_149|p313|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p313_161|p313|I can make one further announcement.
p313_175|p313|It was that kind of night.
p313_174|p313|Dewar is the medium.
p313_160|p313|He'd never run the distance before.
p313_148|p313|A review of the decision is being sought.
p313_389|p313|That time is not far away.
p313_410|p313|I knew people on that committee.
p313_376|p313|She died at her home.
p313_362|p313|It was the same at Twickenham.
p313_404|p313|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p313_202|p313|It looks as though there is no chance.
p313_216|p313|We're still paying the price for that.
p313_014|p313|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p313_028|p313|I intend to raise the matter there.
p313_031|p313|I thought it was quite good.
p313_025|p313|They will be dealt with.
p313_019|p313|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p313_233|p313|They hold on for many years.
p313_227|p313|That figure will always remain with me.
p313_421|p313|It appears to have been closed down.
p313_347|p313|This morning was very quiet.
p313_353|p313|He was made redundant in February of last year.
p313_409|p313|He deserves a top team.
p313_384|p313|We have been preparing all year.
p313_390|p313|I may think about performing it.
p313_145|p313|However, it's not all bad news for women.
p313_151|p313|Surely it can do better than that?
p313_179|p313|He's got a great chance of making it.
p313_186|p313|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p313_192|p313|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p313_193|p313|All these things have an impact.
p313_187|p313|Her daughter is getting married.
p313_178|p313|Any error is severely punished.
p313_150|p313|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p313_144|p313|They played it like a cup final.
p313_391|p313|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p313_385|p313|We could learn a lot from them.
p313_408|p313|I want to keep him.
p313_352|p313|Two others were also seriously injured.
p313_420|p313|Who can tell?
p313_346|p313|My heart is not so sure.
p313_226|p313|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p313_232|p313|It is a technique.
p313_018|p313|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p313_024|p313|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p313_030|p313|We have to put this behind us.
p313_026|p313|It is never an easy game.
p313_032|p313|It was important to win the singles.
p313_224|p313|There is no margin for error.
p313_230|p313|She asked us a lot of questions.
p313_218|p313|It's not a wish list.
p313_350|p313|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p313_344|p313|It's a question of perception.
p313_422|p313|Now, that is a good deal.
p313_378|p313|That's the only thing that matters.
p313_393|p313|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p313_387|p313|Sure, we have problems.
p313_152|p313|I am ashamed of them.
p313_146|p313|But the championship is not over yet.
p313_191|p313|We have understood the problems for some time.
p313_185|p313|The United Nations must act.
p313_184|p313|He quit in October.
p313_190|p313|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p313_147|p313|We haven't found out anything different.
p313_153|p313|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p313_386|p313|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p313_392|p313|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p313_379|p313|I enjoy the creative process.
p313_345|p313|Staff have been informed.
p313_423|p313|The whole nation will be delighted.
p313_351|p313|That might help a bit.
p313_219|p313|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p313_231|p313|It was a stunning strike.
p313_225|p313|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p313_033|p313|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p313_027|p313|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p313_023|p313|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p313_037|p313|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p313_209|p313|The night is young.
p313_221|p313|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p313_235|p313|My body is exhausted.
p313_369|p313|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p313_355|p313|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p313_341|p313|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p313_396|p313|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p313_382|p313|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p313_157|p313|I'm not blaming audiences.
p313_143|p313|However, consumers may take a different view.
p313_194|p313|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p313_180|p313|We won't do that.
p313_181|p313|I hope we do.
p313_195|p313|They believed it worked.
p313_142|p313|It's typical of me.
p313_156|p313|If so, we want to hear from them.
p313_383|p313|It's always the same, isn't it?
p313_397|p313|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
p313_340|p313|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p313_354|p313|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p313_368|p313|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p313_234|p313|Is it the shape of things to come?
p313_220|p313|Some of the players have not progressed.
p313_208|p313|It was good to score the goal today.
p313_036|p313|The waiting is over, well almost.
p313_022|p313|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p313_008|p313|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p313_034|p313|That is impressive by any standards.
p313_020|p313|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p313_236|p313|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p313_222|p313|If not, he should go home.
p313_418|p313|Would they work together again?
p313_342|p313|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p313_356|p313|You've obviously got an answer to it.
p313_381|p313|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p313_395|p313|It's time to fight a decisive battle.
p313_168|p313|This one is a special case.
p313_140|p313|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p313_154|p313|The salary changes are long overdue.
p313_183|p313|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p313_197|p313|They should feel ashamed.
p313_196|p313|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
p313_182|p313|From now on there is no hiding place.
p313_155|p313|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p313_141|p313|That sort of thing is long gone.
p313_169|p313|But what are the songs about?
p313_394|p313|You can't go back and change things.
p313_380|p313|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p313_357|p313|It seems very odd.
p313_343|p313|It's no less intriguing, however.
p313_419|p313|I didn't play all that well.
p313_223|p313|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p313_237|p313|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p313_021|p313|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
p313_035|p313|We are doing very well as we are.
p313_009|p313|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p313_052|p313|What were they?
p313_046|p313|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p313_091|p313|It's a very, very special day.
p313_085|p313|He has lost confidence and weight.
p313_250|p313|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p313_244|p313|This was done by the council staff.
p313_278|p313|Something was plainly wrong.
p313_293|p313|This year, it was a little different.
p313_287|p313|The end result is precisely the same.
p313_324|p313|The referee had a shocking game.
p313_330|p313|We are now in an election period.
p313_318|p313|That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
p313_126|p313|What's the point?
p313_132|p313|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p313_133|p313|I'm sorry to hear this news.
p313_127|p313|Why is this?
p313_319|p313|Why is that?
p313_331|p313|Everyone's too upset to comment.
p313_325|p313|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p313_286|p313|We're talking about the outskirts of London.
p313_292|p313|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p313_279|p313|Why should he go anywhere?
p313_245|p313|The truth is otherwise.
p313_251|p313|Which, in effect, it is.
p313_084|p313|That's why the ministers resigned.
p313_090|p313|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p313_047|p313|We offered something different.
p313_053|p313|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p313_045|p313|I never had a childhood.
p313_051|p313|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p313_079|p313|They must be kept on the ground.
p313_086|p313|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p313_092|p313|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p313_247|p313|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p313_253|p313|It is a memorial.
p313_284|p313|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p313_290|p313|Painful, but only because it's true.
p313_333|p313|But when we do it is great.
p313_327|p313|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p313_131|p313|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p313_125|p313|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p313_119|p313|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p313_118|p313|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p313_124|p313|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p313_130|p313|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p313_326|p313|For a few years we had good fun.
p313_332|p313|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p313_291|p313|It's never over until it's over.
p313_285|p313|I would never even consider it.
p313_252|p313|The man became a reporter.
p313_246|p313|We haven't come out of this very well.
p313_093|p313|There's also the point.
p313_087|p313|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p313_078|p313|We are confident of taking that back.
p313_050|p313|My brother's buried under there.
p313_044|p313|We have not had a formal request.
p313_068|p313|However, there is great potential in this right.
p313_040|p313|They hit me in the head.
p313_054|p313|He will be judged by his actions.
p313_083|p313|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p313_097|p313|But Allen is deadly serious.
p313_242|p313|I tried to push him away.
p313_256|p313|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p313_281|p313|It was a foolhardy decision.
p313_295|p313|We gave them the goal.
p313_336|p313|He pleaded for caution.
p313_322|p313|But will they fall in love?
p313_108|p313|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p313_134|p313|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p313_120|p313|The Tory party will last.
p313_121|p313|It was a journey into a new life.
p313_135|p313|I mean it happens.
p313_109|p313|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p313_323|p313|As if they ever stopped.
p313_294|p313|That, though, is to miss the point.
p313_280|p313|One thing is sure.
p313_257|p313|Nor is it likely to do so.
p313_243|p313|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p313_096|p313|That's the National Grid.
p313_082|p313|This does not help.
p313_055|p313|Her role in it was small.
p313_041|p313|But he is not using them.
p313_069|p313|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p313_057|p313|We might be back next year.
p313_043|p313|We are not moving in.
p313_094|p313|It was forced to divert.
p313_080|p313|Did they give any good advice?
p313_269|p313|The conference is the first test.
p313_255|p313|Our people are paying high prices.
p313_241|p313|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p313_296|p313|Is being naturally funny enough?
p313_282|p313|I'm confident we can do that.
p313_309|p313|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p313_321|p313|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p313_335|p313|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p313_123|p313|There is a great carry over value.
p313_137|p313|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p313_136|p313|This week is a perfect example.
p313_122|p313|It's a way of making a mark.
p313_334|p313|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p313_320|p313|Then came the crunch.
p313_308|p313|It was a simple question.
p313_283|p313|Funding needs to be long term.
p313_297|p313|What's the point of staying sober?
p313_240|p313|Life was like a timetable.
p313_254|p313|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p313_268|p313|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p313_081|p313|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p313_095|p313|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p313_042|p313|That, though, was just the start of it.
p313_056|p313|I've really noticed that this week.
p376_423|p376|I have not been so angry for years.
p376_351|p376|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p376_386|p376|They have given up.
p376_392|p376|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p376_147|p376|We want to keep the pound.
p376_153|p376|The car was perfect.
p376_184|p376|That would be a miracle.
p376_190|p376|I'm really proud of him.
p376_033|p376|We are doing well.
p376_027|p376|We can play better than that.
p376_219|p376|Scotland is the home of golf.
p376_231|p376|I think we did well.
p376_225|p376|They have got off with murder.
p376_224|p376|Who would be out there, singing?
p376_230|p376|They want this research to continue.
p376_218|p376|I am still waiting for her.
p376_026|p376|That was my mistake.
p376_032|p376|It may have been a cry for help.
p376_191|p376|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p376_185|p376|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p376_152|p376|I will not walk away from this job.
p376_146|p376|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p376_393|p376|We are not interested in selling him.
p376_387|p376|That was enough for the committee.
p376_350|p376|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p376_344|p376|Anything would be better than this retirement.
p376_422|p376|That can happen so easily.
p376_378|p376|They took that away.
p376_408|p376|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p376_352|p376|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
p376_420|p376|I can't stop people thinking.
p376_346|p376|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p376_391|p376|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p376_385|p376|There's not going to be a formula.
p376_178|p376|It was an outstanding performance.
p376_150|p376|I am awaiting a reply.
p376_144|p376|We had never seen him before.
p376_193|p376|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
p376_187|p376|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p376_018|p376|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p376_024|p376|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p376_030|p376|I've got to be pleased with that.
p376_226|p376|They had had time for little else.
p376_232|p376|I have never done that.
p376_233|p376|I am just in a state of shock.
p376_227|p376|There is no need for that call.
p376_031|p376|They have done nothing of the sort.
p376_025|p376|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p376_019|p376|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p376_186|p376|That's the law of the land.
p376_192|p376|It's not long enough.
p376_145|p376|He then did just that.
p376_151|p376|There was no need for such a hostel.
p376_179|p376|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p376_384|p376|The attitude was good today.
p376_390|p376|It will vote with the US.
p376_421|p376|That will be best for him.
p376_347|p376|Do not listen to them.
p376_353|p376|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p376_409|p376|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p376_357|p376|It could really have been a disaster.
p376_343|p376|It's not their fault.
p376_419|p376|I've never done that before in my life.
p376_394|p376|They chose to side with terror.
p376_380|p376|They feel it belongs to them.
p376_155|p376|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p376_141|p376|I think we can do well.
p376_169|p376|So we talked about that for a bit.
p376_196|p376|This is very disturbing news.
p376_182|p376|There was some merit in that.
p376_021|p376|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p376_035|p376|We talk about effective military action.
p376_009|p376|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p376_223|p376|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p376_237|p376|Here we go again.
p376_236|p376|He was a legend.
p376_222|p376|And who would argue with that?
p376_008|p376|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p376_034|p376|There was no disruption to services.
p376_020|p376|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p376_183|p376|I can't see him reversing that.
p376_197|p376|I am the leader.
p376_168|p376|She failed to win another game.
p376_140|p376|Dewar is the medium.
p376_154|p376|It just came into my head that day.
p376_381|p376|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p376_395|p376|This must have been severe.
p376_418|p376|Indeed, it has already.
p376_342|p376|There was no evidence against him.
p376_424|p376|Do you mean today?
p376_356|p376|It's one up to the Scots.
p376_340|p376|I know it is going to be difficult.
p376_354|p376|The Israeli military denied the claim.
p376_368|p376|We have got a full house tonight.
p376_383|p376|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p376_397|p376|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p376_142|p376|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p376_156|p376|The opposite is the case.
p376_181|p376|It is a lot of fun.
p376_195|p376|You have no chance of planning permission.
p376_036|p376|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p376_022|p376|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p376_234|p376|I really hope he comes back.
p376_220|p376|That has been lost.
p376_208|p376|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p376_209|p376|It was a bonus for me really.
p376_221|p376|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p376_235|p376|I think it can count against you now.
p376_023|p376|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p376_037|p376|My neighbours are horrified.
p376_194|p376|Appointments should be made on merit.
p376_180|p376|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p376_157|p376|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p376_143|p376|It is part and parcel of it.
p376_396|p376|The firm was working.
p376_382|p376|They too refused to come out and talk.
p376_369|p376|We are looking forward to next season.
p376_355|p376|We don't have the credible evidence.
p376_341|p376|There was no energy behind it.
p376_326|p376|It was an important part of the course.
p376_332|p376|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p376_118|p376|This is really good news for us.
p376_124|p376|Ours is on for two days.
p376_130|p376|It's the start of something new.
p376_078|p376|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p376_050|p376|That takes a lot of courage.
p376_044|p376|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p376_093|p376|That is the worry.
p376_087|p376|The best defence is a good offence.
p376_252|p376|Almost everyone had some input.
p376_246|p376|We certainly will need to watch him.
p376_291|p376|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p376_285|p376|We are playing good football.
p376_284|p376|I am still very much a director.
p376_290|p376|They are still in shock.
p376_247|p376|We are trying to establish a date.
p376_253|p376|We are really good friends.
p376_086|p376|Which is fair enough.
p376_092|p376|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p376_045|p376|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p376_051|p376|We have seen a copy of the report.
p376_079|p376|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p376_131|p376|It doesn't mean that much.
p376_125|p376|And we were very lucky.
p376_119|p376|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p376_333|p376|They are unable to say anything.
p376_327|p376|Who will take them after that?
p376_319|p376|Now that business is banned.
p376_331|p376|I have so much respect for him.
p376_325|p376|But they will be less attractive than that.
p376_133|p376|The trust has no magic wand.
p376_127|p376|There were moments of humour too.
p376_047|p376|A major is a major.
p376_053|p376|Other people also tried.
p376_084|p376|They would never let him go.
p376_090|p376|It was nice to come back.
p376_279|p376|It was worth the wait.
p376_245|p376|There is a growing anger among the group.
p376_251|p376|Nothing has been decided yet.
p376_286|p376|It is not normal practice.
p376_292|p376|There was mystery back then.
p376_293|p376|I can't believe that is the way forward.
p376_287|p376|This is a major step forward for the carers.
p376_250|p376|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p376_244|p376|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p376_278|p376|Since then it has become a tradition.
p376_091|p376|It's a step forward.
p376_085|p376|It will not work a second time.
p376_052|p376|He will be greatly missed.
p376_046|p376|We are worried about casualties.
p376_126|p376|The group will report back in the summer.
p376_132|p376|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p376_324|p376|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p376_330|p376|It seems to be politics at work again.
p376_318|p376|I'm a bit annoyed.
p376_334|p376|There would be famine.
p376_320|p376|Worse still, it can be infectious.
p376_308|p376|We will listen to colleagues.
p376_136|p376|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p376_122|p376|It was like being in prison.
p376_042|p376|I was all alone.
p376_056|p376|There were no reports of casualties.
p376_081|p376|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p376_095|p376|The bookies have got it about right.
p376_240|p376|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p376_254|p376|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p376_268|p376|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p376_283|p376|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p376_297|p376|They made a huge impression on me.
p376_296|p376|Promises were not kept.
p376_282|p376|It is no surprise at all.
p376_269|p376|It was the same expression of joy.
p376_255|p376|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p376_241|p376|However, the story may have an happy ending.
p376_094|p376|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p376_080|p376|I have been very stupid.
p376_057|p376|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p376_043|p376|It's harder, believe me.
p376_123|p376|That has given me great confidence.
p376_137|p376|I feel it is very irrational.
p376_309|p376|Is Saddam a threat?
p376_321|p376|It is just not working.
p376_335|p376|We believe we have a strong case.
p376_323|p376|It was just great.
p376_337|p376|Some problems were too complex.
p376_121|p376|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p376_135|p376|That was not the norm.
p376_109|p376|It is not just about the money.
p376_055|p376|I'm looking forward to the next two weeks.
p376_041|p376|Who did it doesn't really matter.
p376_069|p376|It is the worst of both worlds.
p376_096|p376|Audiences there were shocked.
p376_082|p376|They are not a set of options.
p376_257|p376|I really wanted the part.
p376_243|p376|But he will do anything.
p376_294|p376|Some promoters made insulting offers.
p376_280|p376|It was then into overtime.
p376_281|p376|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p376_295|p376|I see no need to change.
p376_242|p376|We played too deeply.
p376_256|p376|That, he claimed, was essential.
p376_083|p376|But it was money well spent.
p376_097|p376|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p376_068|p376|This was an hour before the show.
p376_040|p376|However, you never know.
p376_054|p376|But Harry has become a franchise.
p376_108|p376|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p376_134|p376|Tony Blair said as little.
p376_120|p376|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p376_336|p376|It is highly unlikely.
p376_322|p376|We didn't know he was even out.
p376_307|p376|What's the big idea?
p376_313|p376|I'm not afraid of that.
p376_139|p376|He's had a lot of injury problems.
p376_105|p376|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p376_111|p376|But the casting is also bizarre.
p376_059|p376|This can be extreme.
p376_071|p376|It has really been quite appalling.
p376_065|p376|It will be great.
p376_273|p376|We want to sort it out.
p376_267|p376|I've just got to build on this now.
p376_298|p376|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p376_299|p376|It's not in my nature.
p376_266|p376|I'm just going to do my best.
p376_272|p376|I don't suppose it matters that much.
p376_064|p376|For example they could be in school uniform.
p376_070|p376|It has not come.
p376_058|p376|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p376_110|p376|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p376_104|p376|I probably was wrong.
p376_138|p376|We are not giving up.
p376_312|p376|I feel privileged to be here.
p376_306|p376|I have been doing it for years.
p376_338|p376|I drove the ball well.
p376_310|p376|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p376_304|p376|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p376_112|p376|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p376_106|p376|We have already begun to do that here.
p376_066|p376|It was a good win for us.
p376_072|p376|This is a huge event.
p376_099|p376|We're still in the process of making changes.
p376_258|p376|He had other things on his mind.
p376_264|p376|Nothing else will do.
p376_270|p376|I should be doing that for her.
p376_271|p376|That is a personal matter.
p376_265|p376|There is a precedent for the theory.
p376_259|p376|He died in September.
p376_098|p376|It's just not very nice.
p376_073|p376|He was all blackened.
p376_067|p376|It seems a waste of talents.
p376_107|p376|After that, it's never the same again.
p376_113|p376|Now is not the moment to leave.
p376_305|p376|The time for change is now.
p376_311|p376|It was good to score the goal today.
p376_339|p376|It was all image and no substance.
p376_315|p376|I am extremely cautious.
p376_301|p376|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p376_329|p376|But there was a heavy price to pay.
p376_117|p376|Eleven events are required.
p376_103|p376|Nothing is going right at the moment.
p376_063|p376|It seems to have worked.
p376_077|p376|An appeal was unlikely.
p376_088|p376|This is a historic agreement.
p376_261|p376|But it's there to be won.
p376_275|p376|It was to no avail.
p376_249|p376|I love this tournament.
p376_248|p376|It was love of Helen and the children.
p376_274|p376|We will not get rid of them.
p376_260|p376|It was just a matter of time.
p376_089|p376|That is the case and remains the case.
p376_076|p376|We need to know more about her.
p376_062|p376|Michael, he is running!
p376_102|p376|Now he is in charge of this.
p376_116|p376|It's not even finished.
p376_328|p376|They were both very brave.
p376_300|p376|He was really great.
p376_314|p376|It is the icing on the cake.
p376_302|p376|It's going to be massive.
p376_316|p376|What are the likely solutions?
p376_100|p376|He is doing the right things.
p376_114|p376|But what are the songs about?
p376_128|p376|They were too hard.
p376_074|p376|This is a big game for them.
p376_060|p376|And that is about it.
p376_048|p376|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p376_276|p376|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p376_262|p376|I'm so proud of my team.
p376_289|p376|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
p376_288|p376|Together, we can make a difference.
p376_263|p376|I hope we can still find a solution.
p376_277|p376|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p376_049|p376|We are in the hat.
p376_061|p376|Maybe it will work there.
p376_075|p376|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p376_129|p376|We have been very patient.
p376_115|p376|We have still got the fight in us.
p376_101|p376|Blood samples were taken.
p376_317|p376|I spoke to him yesterday.
p376_303|p376|I was close enough.
p376_358|p376|There was nothing anyone could do.
p376_364|p376|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p376_402|p376|Instead, she just went away.
p376_416|p376|They were good neighbours.
p376_370|p376|It cannot go on for ever like this.
p376_166|p376|And the other winners are.
p376_172|p376|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p376_199|p376|I'd already had them all.
p376_012|p376|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p376_006|p376|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p376_238|p376|Israel has done very little until now.
p376_210|p376|Today is not about contracts.
p376_204|p376|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p376_205|p376|I fell into it by accident.
p376_211|p376|We are going for it.
p376_239|p376|Their attitude was great.
p376_007|p376|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p376_013|p376|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p376_198|p376|There is a pause.
p376_173|p376|I am not against a further inquiry.
p376_167|p376|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p376_417|p376|It is essential that we win the game.
p376_371|p376|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p376_365|p376|I learned that only yesterday.
p376_403|p376|I am glad that he is angry.
p376_359|p376|I told him to stop.
p376_373|p376|In the event, it was to be the latter.
p376_415|p376|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p376_401|p376|Is it a warning to parents?
p376_367|p376|Are you in this movie?
p376_398|p376|This one would have been.
p376_159|p376|It was good to work with them.
p376_171|p376|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p376_165|p376|The minister is the engineer.
p376_039|p376|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p376_005|p376|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p376_011|p376|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p376_207|p376|More cases are expected.
p376_213|p376|But he will be extremely active.
p376_212|p376|Neither has gone to war.
p376_206|p376|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p376_010|p376|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p376_004|p376|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p376_038|p376|Fuller was the difference.
p376_164|p376|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p376_170|p376|I don't think we could have expected better.
p376_158|p376|He also seems to have been around forever.
p376_399|p376|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p376_400|p376|I was never invited.
p376_366|p376|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p376_372|p376|We would expect it to disappear in time.
p376_414|p376|I was not about to hit him.
p376_410|p376|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p376_376|p376|It was just one of those things.
p376_362|p376|It's fantastic to win again.
p376_404|p376|We were fortunate to get an own goal.
p376_389|p376|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p376_174|p376|As well it might be.
p376_160|p376|We want to replicate that success.
p376_148|p376|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p376_014|p376|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p376_028|p376|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p376_202|p376|I've never regretted coming here.
p376_216|p376|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p376_217|p376|He didn't win the title.
p376_203|p376|This is the last straw.
p376_029|p376|I am not interested in the past.
p376_015|p376|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p376_001|p376|Please call Stella.
p376_149|p376|That never seemed likely.
p376_161|p376|I played well but missed a few chances.
p376_175|p376|That is no bad thing.
p376_388|p376|In many ways it was disastrous.
p376_363|p376|I'm delighted for the lads.
p376_405|p376|They were assured that it would.
p376_411|p376|It was a surprising decision.
p376_377|p376|We very much regret that it has occurred.
p376_407|p376|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p376_361|p376|His strike was superb.
p376_375|p376|The state is controlled by the left.
p376_413|p376|That will be the office.
p376_349|p376|It was a tactical change.
p376_163|p376|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p376_177|p376|This statement has never been withdrawn.
p376_188|p376|This is still not good enough.
p376_017|p376|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p376_003|p376|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p376_215|p376|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p376_201|p376|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p376_229|p376|It does not stop at the border.
p376_228|p376|More than half of the school collapsed.
p376_200|p376|Three years ago he would have been.
p376_214|p376|There was a bit of pressure.
p376_002|p376|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p376_016|p376|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their homes in the sky.
p376_189|p376|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p376_176|p376|There was no basis for their arrest.
p376_162|p376|One of these problems is the railways.
p376_348|p376|This is the direction we need to go.
p376_374|p376|We are just waiting for news.
p376_412|p376|He's a very promising player, indeed.
p376_406|p376|And huge, indeed, it is.
p376_360|p376|Now they have to do something about it.
p347_139|p347|He had reason to be pleased.
p347_313|p347|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p347_307|p347|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p347_298|p347|I know you went back this morning.
p347_267|p347|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p347_273|p347|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p347_065|p347|This is a big, big win.
p347_071|p347|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p347_059|p347|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p347_058|p347|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p347_070|p347|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p347_064|p347|I've taken to the hills.
p347_272|p347|It will be the final push.
p347_266|p347|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p347_299|p347|They played it like a cup final.
p347_306|p347|And we were right.
p347_312|p347|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p347_138|p347|I thought it was quite good.
p347_104|p347|Safety was also an issue.
p347_110|p347|It needs somebody to give way.
p347_106|p347|I know a lot of people who don't.
p347_112|p347|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p347_304|p347|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p347_310|p347|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p347_338|p347|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p347_270|p347|The whole region is in shock.
p347_264|p347|Players want to know what is on offer.
p347_258|p347|I am a little bit tired.
p347_099|p347|Could they perhaps be related?
p347_072|p347|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p347_066|p347|The crowd was awesome.
p347_067|p347|My game is in pretty good shape.
p347_073|p347|They had not been handcuffed.
p347_098|p347|What's it got to do with art?
p347_259|p347|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p347_265|p347|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p347_271|p347|It was a journey into a new life.
p347_339|p347|You encourage them - you can do it.
p347_311|p347|I think that could work to our advantage.
p347_305|p347|The chief constable is right.
p347_113|p347|They are all Arabs.
p347_107|p347|There was nobody on the roof.
p347_103|p347|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p347_117|p347|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p347_329|p347|There is no date on this document.
p347_301|p347|I will carry on.
p347_315|p347|We hope this scheme will change that.
p347_249|p347|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p347_275|p347|It is a very interesting subject.
p347_261|p347|It had been in place since last July.
p347_088|p347|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p347_077|p347|One thing is certain.
p347_063|p347|It sounded awfully like panic.
p347_062|p347|The message is just not getting through.
p347_076|p347|You have to rely on each other.
p347_089|p347|Theatre is not a museum.
p347_260|p347|I was just overwhelmed.
p347_274|p347|You were the kidnappers.
p347_248|p347|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p347_314|p347|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p347_300|p347|This has a number of benefits.
p347_328|p347|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p347_116|p347|That is our unfinished business.
p347_102|p347|I'm looking forward to that.
p347_128|p347|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p347_114|p347|The days of empty promises are over.
p347_100|p347|But who shot the president?
p347_316|p347|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p347_302|p347|I think it is a great shame.
p347_289|p347|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p347_262|p347|I have just got to get back.
p347_276|p347|Arguably, they have already done it.
p347_048|p347|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p347_060|p347|It is a very special city.
p347_074|p347|I think we will join the single currency.
p347_075|p347|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347_061|p347|This is only the start of my season.
p347_049|p347|Everything was an effort.
p347_277|p347|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p347_263|p347|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p347_288|p347|I mean it happens.
p347_303|p347|A review of the decision is being sought.
p347_317|p347|The red card was okay.
p347_101|p347|We do not get that impression now.
p347_115|p347|Henry was strong and talented.
p347_129|p347|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p347_199|p347|It's not right of Labour.
p347_172|p347|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p347_166|p347|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p347_416|p347|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p347_370|p347|It's an internal matter.
p347_364|p347|I was a little surprised.
p347_402|p347|It was not a foul.
p347_358|p347|Smith has not let him down.
p347_204|p347|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p347_210|p347|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p347_238|p347|That is the key message.
p347_006|p347|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p347_012|p347|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p347_013|p347|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p347_007|p347|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p347_239|p347|It ignores the future.
p347_211|p347|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p347_205|p347|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p347_359|p347|Which he can do.
p347_365|p347|It was a bit like having children.
p347_403|p347|I get very excited by that.
p347_417|p347|There's nothing for you here.
p347_371|p347|They should feel ashamed.
p347_167|p347|It's going to be epic.
p347_173|p347|I never found my rhythm.
p347_198|p347|Our approach will be different.
p347_165|p347|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p347_171|p347|British officials said they could not say.
p347_159|p347|I was in jail for five years.
p347_398|p347|Some of the players have not progressed.
p347_401|p347|Why should we even be asked to share?
p347_367|p347|They believed it worked.
p347_373|p347|We're delighted about the vote.
p347_415|p347|What exactly is your job?
p347_213|p347|Or some thought that they have.
p347_207|p347|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p347_011|p347|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p347_005|p347|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p347_039|p347|We've tried every other way.
p347_038|p347|We have nothing to say about that.
p347_004|p347|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p347_010|p347|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p347_206|p347|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p347_212|p347|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p347_372|p347|You realise what this means?
p347_414|p347|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p347_400|p347|There is no margin for error.
p347_366|p347|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p347_399|p347|They were both very brave.
p347_158|p347|That's been our position all along.
p347_170|p347|She could easily have been killed.
p347_164|p347|We were very much a happy family.
p347_148|p347|Is the war over?
p347_160|p347|We have not had a formal request.
p347_174|p347|I didn't mean to kill her.
p347_389|p347|I suspect that it will.
p347_362|p347|And we're talking Big Money.
p347_404|p347|The members have clearly spoken.
p347_410|p347|It was a stunning strike.
p347_376|p347|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p347_216|p347|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p347_202|p347|Before the games it was pretty open.
p347_028|p347|There are moments of silence.
p347_014|p347|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p347_001|p347|Please call Stella.
p347_015|p347|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p347_029|p347|So now this series has had its day.
p347_203|p347|But you can go beyond that condition.
p347_217|p347|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p347_411|p347|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p347_377|p347|It is just completely erased.
p347_363|p347|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p347_405|p347|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p347_388|p347|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p347_175|p347|It is a job creation scheme.
p347_161|p347|I never had a childhood.
p347_149|p347|You do have a way out.
p347_188|p347|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p347_177|p347|We might be back next year.
p347_163|p347|We offered something different.
p347_349|p347|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p347_375|p347|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p347_413|p347|We are going through difficult times.
p347_407|p347|Which means it matters.
p347_361|p347|They were that poor.
p347_229|p347|It is time for a more honest approach.
p347_201|p347|We went straight into the bedroom.
p347_215|p347|That was moving the goalposts.
p347_003|p347|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p347_017|p347|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p347_016|p347|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p347_002|p347|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p347_214|p347|He has lost confidence and weight.
p347_200|p347|It is legally binding.
p347_228|p347|The damage has been done.
p347_406|p347|I believe in God.
p347_360|p347|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p347_374|p347|They were only there for three weeks.
p347_412|p347|She said he showed no remorse.
p347_348|p347|He's got a great chance of making it.
p347_162|p347|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p347_176|p347|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p347_189|p347|There was an element of jealousy.
p347_190|p347|Glasgow then took control.
p347_184|p347|The firm was down and almost out.
p347_153|p347|But he is not using them.
p347_147|p347|Too many factors are now working against him.
p347_392|p347|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p347_386|p347|Is that where we are?
p347_351|p347|So now you know.
p347_345|p347|Our future was his future.
p347_423|p347|I have not come in to take over.
p347_379|p347|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p347_225|p347|But Annika is just amazing.
p347_231|p347|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p347_219|p347|Two and a half million people have died.
p347_027|p347|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p347_033|p347|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p347_032|p347|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p347_026|p347|We still have a long, long way to go.
p347_218|p347|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p347_230|p347|That's the National Grid.
p347_224|p347|You can never tell.
p347_378|p347|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p347_344|p347|It is very much a matter for them.
p347_422|p347|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p347_350|p347|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p347_387|p347|We used to keep our business rates.
p347_393|p347|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p347_146|p347|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p347_152|p347|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p347_185|p347|I was chosen to do this.
p347_191|p347|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p347_187|p347|I think we're very different.
p347_193|p347|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p347_144|p347|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p347_150|p347|It is simple, really.
p347_178|p347|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p347_385|p347|They didn't find anything.
p347_391|p347|There was no energy behind it.
p347_420|p347|I just want to get rid of it.
p347_346|p347|His name is Michael Owen.
p347_352|p347|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p347_408|p347|There is great potential on this river.
p347_232|p347|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p347_226|p347|Our job is to change that.
p347_030|p347|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p347_024|p347|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p347_018|p347|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p347_019|p347|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p347_025|p347|A crucial moment has arrived.
p347_031|p347|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p347_227|p347|She will also get a pay rise.
p347_233|p347|It is a big time for me.
p347_409|p347|We can't win a big game.
p347_353|p347|It's a very special unit.
p347_421|p347|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p347_347|p347|It has made a difference.
p347_390|p347|But there's no eye contact.
p347_384|p347|There are moments of honesty, too.
p347_179|p347|The same goes for personnel.
p347_151|p347|I just wasn't very good.
p347_145|p347|That alibi is now gone.
p347_192|p347|My ambitions are still with football.
p347_186|p347|I learned a lot from that.
p347_182|p347|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p347_196|p347|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p347_169|p347|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p347_141|p347|That is impressive by any standards.
p347_155|p347|I certainly believe we can do it.
p347_380|p347|It's not just for classical music.
p347_394|p347|I took a minibus into town.
p347_419|p347|They wanted to show what they could do.
p347_343|p347|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p347_357|p347|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p347_237|p347|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p347_223|p347|I hope they understand that.
p347_009|p347|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p347_035|p347|His views are hardly surprising.
p347_021|p347|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p347_020|p347|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p347_034|p347|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p347_008|p347|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p347_222|p347|Do not forget about Monaco.
p347_236|p347|It is a cause for concern.
p347_356|p347|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p347_342|p347|Britain is a peaceful nation.
p347_424|p347|Is this accurate?
p347_418|p347|I grew up listening to these people.
p347_395|p347|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p347_381|p347|This must be kept in total perspective.
p347_154|p347|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p347_140|p347|It was important to win the singles.
p347_168|p347|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p347_197|p347|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p347_183|p347|This area is perfect for children.
p347_195|p347|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p347_181|p347|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p347_156|p347|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
p347_142|p347|I felt we needed to bring that in.
p347_397|p347|It is not a wish list.
p347_383|p347|All of the names are familiar to me.
p347_368|p347|I'm really proud of my young players.
p347_354|p347|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p347_340|p347|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p347_208|p347|Who can tell?
p347_220|p347|It could not be too high.
p347_234|p347|There were two things going on at once.
p347_022|p347|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p347_036|p347|It is time for a new approach.
p347_037|p347|And look at the leading conductors, he says.
p347_023|p347|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p347_235|p347|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p347_221|p347|Or so it would appear.
p347_209|p347|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p347_341|p347|I always said No.
p347_355|p347|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p347_369|p347|As it happened, it was much more than that.
p347_382|p347|Election results are expected soon.
p347_396|p347|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p347_143|p347|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p347_157|p347|It was a breathtaking moment.
p347_180|p347|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p347_194|p347|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p347_130|p347|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p347_124|p347|They will do their own thing.
p347_118|p347|Faces from the Eighties.
p347_332|p347|I know nothing about that.
p347_326|p347|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p347_285|p347|Working with him is like working with myself.
p347_291|p347|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p347_246|p347|There is only one caveat.
p347_252|p347|There are a few changes.
p347_087|p347|This is a club on the rise.
p347_093|p347|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p347_044|p347|It does make a big difference.
p347_050|p347|And does it even matter?
p347_078|p347|We cannot ask for them back.
p347_079|p347|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p347_051|p347|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p347_045|p347|How many cases have there been?
p347_092|p347|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p347_086|p347|It's a true story.
p347_253|p347|You're not going to get hurt.
p347_247|p347|We are still getting signals.
p347_290|p347|Debbie Harry was cool.
p347_284|p347|It's in the eyes.
p347_327|p347|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p347_333|p347|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p347_119|p347|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p347_125|p347|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p347_131|p347|YOU thought it was a headache.
p347_127|p347|It is just part of modern day life.
p347_133|p347|It is never an easy game.
p347_325|p347|I haven't won the world title.
p347_331|p347|I am not changing my event.
p347_319|p347|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p347_292|p347|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p347_286|p347|It is just too long since the war.
p347_251|p347|Everyone can be bought.
p347_245|p347|Do not go into government buildings.
p347_279|p347|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p347_090|p347|It is a hangover effect.
p347_084|p347|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p347_053|p347|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p347_047|p347|You can't give in to the vandals.
p347_046|p347|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p347_052|p347|My parents are exhausted.
p347_085|p347|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p347_091|p347|This is my life.
p347_278|p347|Raymond was always on the outside.
p347_244|p347|He's in with the furniture.
p347_250|p347|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p347_287|p347|She didn't tell us anything new.
p347_293|p347|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p347_318|p347|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p347_330|p347|And now he tells us.
p347_324|p347|This is my music.
p347_132|p347|All the people thought that we would die.
p347_126|p347|We are in the business of selling tickets.
p347_122|p347|You can cope with it.
p347_136|p347|I don't want to come down.
p347_308|p347|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p347_320|p347|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p347_334|p347|That is as it may be.
p347_297|p347|However, consumers may take a different view.
p347_283|p347|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p347_268|p347|The singer's condition was not specified.
p347_254|p347|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p347_240|p347|This is the subway.
p347_095|p347|We gave them the goal.
p347_081|p347|All of us do.
p347_056|p347|My thoughts are with their families.
p347_043|p347|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p347_057|p347|It will come up here.
p347_080|p347|No-one said anything to me.
p347_094|p347|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p347_241|p347|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p347_255|p347|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p347_269|p347|How much of a cop out is that?
p347_282|p347|There are no plans to change this.
p347_296|p347|Raised the way you want it.
p347_335|p347|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p347_321|p347|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p347_309|p347|Surely it can do better than that?
p347_137|p347|However, it's good to turn the page.
p347_123|p347|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p347_109|p347|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p347_135|p347|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p347_121|p347|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p347_337|p347|Eleven events are required.
p347_323|p347|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p347_280|p347|I could feel the blood on my face.
p347_294|p347|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
p347_243|p347|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p347_257|p347|I heard some of his remarks.
p347_082|p347|That is in the public domain.
p347_096|p347|They don't take you to mass graves.
p347_069|p347|He already had had complaints.
p347_041|p347|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p347_055|p347|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p347_054|p347|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p347_040|p347|I'll have to go out and impress.
p347_068|p347|We were given a break.
p347_097|p347|There was no option.
p347_083|p347|The Hague is too good for him.
p347_256|p347|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p347_242|p347|What's the rush?
p347_295|p347|It is typical of me.
p347_281|p347|I am a committed European.
p347_322|p347|I was doing well at the hustings.
p347_336|p347|This is the start of a new campaign.
p347_120|p347|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p347_134|p347|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p347_108|p347|Clark is back on top form.
p340_347|p340|It was like someone had died.
p340_409|p340|It will not be easy.
p340_390|p340|It is a challenge for all of us.
p340_384|p340|We have a plan in place.
p340_151|p340|Annika is very, very fit.
p340_145|p340|He will have to live with his words.
p340_179|p340|They are just trying to cover up.
p340_192|p340|It works, as well.
p340_186|p340|I want to be frank.
p340_025|p340|It would be nice.
p340_031|p340|He was very close.
p340_019|p340|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p340_227|p340|So there, we won.
p340_233|p340|So it should be.
p340_232|p340|Later, a very different story emerged.
p340_226|p340|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p340_018|p340|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p340_030|p340|We've not won anything yet.
p340_024|p340|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p340_187|p340|This was an option from the beginning.
p340_193|p340|I can't say anything.
p340_178|p340|We can't determine that clearly.
p340_144|p340|How did he know?
p340_150|p340|He is advised that he has done so.
p340_385|p340|That is to miss the point.
p340_391|p340|The children are fine.
p340_408|p340|My daughter was really, really innocent.
p340_420|p340|It was one New Year.
p340_346|p340|You know the score.
p340_352|p340|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p340_344|p340|They said they would.
p340_422|p340|Our policy is already working well.
p340_350|p340|He has been under great pressure.
p340_378|p340|What's in a name?
p340_387|p340|I didn't see it.
p340_393|p340|There's also the point.
p340_146|p340|Openness is always the best way.
p340_152|p340|This is not quite right.
p340_185|p340|Of course the ending was fantastic.
p340_191|p340|We haven't been able to go and see.
p340_032|p340|But someone has to take them.
p340_026|p340|We are not prepared to do that.
p340_230|p340|He may have a long wait.
p340_224|p340|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p340_218|p340|I am feeling a bit better.
p340_219|p340|Everyone here is heartbroken.
p340_225|p340|You have to keep it on the fairways.
p340_231|p340|They have already done that.
p340_027|p340|We've just decided to do something about it.
p340_033|p340|We don't find any danger from them.
p340_190|p340|I think it was just a tragic accident.
p340_184|p340|But that is not an issue for now.
p340_153|p340|It really is tremendous.
p340_147|p340|It added to the spectacle.
p340_392|p340|I don't believe in God.
p340_386|p340|It will be a new experience.
p340_379|p340|It feels like a winner already.
p340_351|p340|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p340_345|p340|When will this change?
p340_423|p340|I believe we have a good chance.
p340_369|p340|Frankly it was disgusting.
p340_341|p340|She is deeply distressed.
p340_355|p340|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p340_382|p340|We were all afraid.
p340_396|p340|He got his degree.
p340_143|p340|It looks like a hit.
p340_157|p340|So we started building a home.
p340_180|p340|Are you the man from The Herald?
p340_194|p340|I would be interested in another attempt.
p340_037|p340|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p340_209|p340|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p340_235|p340|It's hard to say.
p340_221|p340|He was also a great man.
p340_220|p340|Not so, it seems.
p340_234|p340|They didn't find any substance.
p340_208|p340|We lost out a little bit.
p340_022|p340|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p340_036|p340|Who was that?
p340_195|p340|However, that is a sizeable if.
p340_181|p340|And that's it?
p340_156|p340|The wind was coming from all directions.
p340_142|p340|I have a moral dilemma.
p340_397|p340|And rugby fans can help.
p340_383|p340|I hadn't had that before.
p340_354|p340|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p340_340|p340|I'll need to discuss it with my family.
p340_368|p340|Things are on track.
p340_418|p340|Are you watching Liverpool?
p340_356|p340|But he did not appear.
p340_342|p340|They should have listened to me.
p340_424|p340|Things were not easy from the outset.
p340_395|p340|It wasn't the second one.
p340_381|p340|There was no question of him not impressing.
p340_168|p340|They did a very good job.
p340_154|p340|I've never regretted my decision.
p340_140|p340|Don't hold your breath.
p340_197|p340|This was all well and good.
p340_183|p340|We are really good friends.
p340_008|p340|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p340_020|p340|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p340_034|p340|Do you think they would do any better?
p340_222|p340|We have no further comment to make.
p340_236|p340|Her heart was not in it.
p340_237|p340|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p340_223|p340|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
p340_035|p340|They were appalling, disgraceful.
p340_021|p340|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p340_009|p340|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p340_182|p340|I came here this week to work.
p340_196|p340|There is no other way.
p340_141|p340|He was shaking like a leaf.
p340_155|p340|This is a recipe for disaster.
p340_169|p340|It has been a waste of time.
p340_380|p340|They are expected to be released today.
p340_394|p340|It's good to be back.
p340_343|p340|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
p340_357|p340|So he was anxious to try something new.
p340_419|p340|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p340_330|p340|Let's make him a show.
p340_324|p340|Will they fall in love?
p340_318|p340|They have not changed at all.
p340_132|p340|Who do you think will win?
p340_126|p340|We are in the end game.
p340_046|p340|It would be another reason to live.
p340_052|p340|These people are not big names.
p340_085|p340|It is a potential danger.
p340_091|p340|It could be to do with the location.
p340_244|p340|The medal itself is not that important.
p340_250|p340|The film was great.
p340_278|p340|We have worked well with them for years.
p340_287|p340|And that is very good indeed.
p340_293|p340|The Dream is as hard as they come.
p340_292|p340|It is set in Paris.
p340_286|p340|I have spoken to my brother.
p340_279|p340|They've had a good start as well.
p340_251|p340|I'm just enjoying every match.
p340_245|p340|I should think so, too.
p340_090|p340|He said, we're delighted by the vote.
p340_084|p340|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p340_053|p340|Don't you believe it.
p340_047|p340|I felt under a lot of pressure.
p340_127|p340|This is not the case.
p340_133|p340|I certainly would not accept this decision.
p340_319|p340|One is investment, one is reform.
p340_325|p340|There was nothing sinister in that.
p340_331|p340|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p340_327|p340|Is that what it's about?
p340_333|p340|It seemed so personal.
p340_125|p340|They said they were only young men.
p340_131|p340|It is a strong case.
p340_119|p340|And it worked, so we kept it.
p340_051|p340|This has been a difficult time for me.
p340_045|p340|I have lost all confidence.
p340_079|p340|He is now back in Britain.
p340_092|p340|This is a terrible tragedy.
p340_086|p340|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p340_253|p340|I am not a liar.
p340_247|p340|They deserved to beat us in the replay.
p340_290|p340|It wasn't really like that at all.
p340_284|p340|The car was just there.
p340_285|p340|They were very unfair to him.
p340_291|p340|What will happen to them now?
p340_246|p340|The time for change is now.
p340_252|p340|They set up to win the hole.
p340_087|p340|But we never wanted to do that here.
p340_093|p340|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p340_078|p340|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340_044|p340|That was a month ago.
p340_050|p340|But it was no problem.
p340_118|p340|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p340_130|p340|You need that freedom in society.
p340_124|p340|She was not hard done by.
p340_332|p340|People are using it in their daily lives.
p340_326|p340|But don't just take my word for it.
p340_322|p340|I am extremely cautious.
p340_336|p340|I think we have got the balance right.
p340_108|p340|Fishing is a declining industry.
p340_120|p340|The king is delighted by the honour.
p340_134|p340|That was one very hard game.
p340_068|p340|It is time for the talking to stop.
p340_054|p340|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p340_040|p340|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p340_097|p340|You will never get a conviction.
p340_083|p340|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p340_256|p340|It was quite simply, delicious.
p340_242|p340|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p340_295|p340|It shows the right amount of progress.
p340_281|p340|One thing is clear.
p340_280|p340|The director's a genius.
p340_294|p340|We are not collecting.
p340_243|p340|We just did not want to believe it.
p340_257|p340|I can't believe it happened.
p340_082|p340|It is time to be realistic.
p340_096|p340|It is a matter of clarity.
p340_041|p340|We didn't deserve to win.
p340_055|p340|We did something about it.
p340_069|p340|We were very close.
p340_135|p340|He said something in his work.
p340_121|p340|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p340_109|p340|Another man said, It was horrible.
p340_337|p340|It was a very terrible thing.
p340_323|p340|That was always the danger.
p340_309|p340|What is their concern?
p340_335|p340|The government agreed to pay.
p340_321|p340|Structural changes will never be enough.
p340_137|p340|This research is extremely promising.
p340_123|p340|Yes, we can beat them.
p340_043|p340|We can hardly talk about it.
p340_057|p340|It needs a rethink.
p340_080|p340|There was no commission.
p340_094|p340|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
p340_269|p340|That, though, is not true.
p340_241|p340|Government funding is not a problem.
p340_255|p340|We also hope to meet the men.
p340_282|p340|We might never see him again.
p340_296|p340|I thought the dancing was over.
p340_297|p340|I think they have got it completely right.
p340_283|p340|Such as it is.
p340_254|p340|Let's make this clear.
p340_240|p340|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p340_268|p340|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
p340_095|p340|He said he never saw it.
p340_081|p340|There was a vacuum.
p340_056|p340|Where is the money coming from?
p340_042|p340|This is great news.
p340_122|p340|My body is clearly capable.
p340_136|p340|I recommend a tour.
p340_320|p340|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p340_334|p340|Would that be for men and women?
p340_308|p340|She died a few days later.
p340_311|p340|That is why we are here.
p340_305|p340|We will not give up on the truth.
p340_339|p340|It has been an extremely long haul.
p340_113|p340|The film is on a tightrope.
p340_107|p340|That was my first reaction.
p340_067|p340|It's probably just as well.
p340_073|p340|This can be extreme.
p340_098|p340|He did not have to stop and think.
p340_265|p340|I am very relieved.
p340_271|p340|They made up for it on Saturday.
p340_259|p340|The game will be at a football stadium.
p340_258|p340|Thankfully it was cleared up.
p340_270|p340|I hope he comes back.
p340_264|p340|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
p340_099|p340|We deserved to win it.
p340_072|p340|However, that is just for starters.
p340_066|p340|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p340_106|p340|He didn't bother a soul.
p340_112|p340|Are there any he wants to play?
p340_338|p340|Let's not take too much for granted.
p340_304|p340|We are not there yet.
p340_310|p340|The difference was amazing.
p340_306|p340|Sub Not Used, McCall.
p340_312|p340|But it is historic.
p340_104|p340|So what is the problem?
p340_110|p340|That's the way it goes.
p340_138|p340|I was invited to work in Germany.
p340_070|p340|If only it were so.
p340_064|p340|That, however, was the exception.
p340_058|p340|Why does it work?
p340_272|p340|That was our mission.
p340_266|p340|The people have been really friendly.
p340_299|p340|He's already made history.
p340_298|p340|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p340_267|p340|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p340_273|p340|I am delighted for them.
p340_059|p340|He would have been wrong.
p340_065|p340|This has been a long process.
p340_071|p340|They do not deliver.
p340_139|p340|Weather conditions were good, he added.
p340_111|p340|But we still don't know.
p340_105|p340|We believe it to be completely without merit.
p340_313|p340|You have to feel for the guy.
p340_307|p340|Now they had it.
p340_303|p340|I've heard it all before.
p340_317|p340|They want that school.
p340_129|p340|It is the same old story.
p340_101|p340|It's just not funny!
p340_115|p340|I have never been in anything like that.
p340_049|p340|It is somewhere to be.
p340_075|p340|Would she remember the music?
p340_061|p340|He was right of course.
p340_277|p340|I've done it all.
p340_263|p340|People were very confused.
p340_288|p340|We could have had no new money.
p340_289|p340|It wasn't an easy decision.
p340_262|p340|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p340_276|p340|They might be surprised by the response.
p340_060|p340|He played really, really well.
p340_074|p340|I'm sure that they will learn.
p340_048|p340|None of the pieces was commissioned.
p340_114|p340|It was a question of patience.
p340_100|p340|Or did it?
p340_128|p340|There may be some resistance.
p340_316|p340|You know it was good fun.
p340_302|p340|They are not left wing.
p340_328|p340|And the audience is a surprise.
p340_314|p340|I have still to hear about that.
p340_300|p340|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p340_116|p340|I have done ever since it was published.
p340_102|p340|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p340_062|p340|It's there for people to look at.
p340_076|p340|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p340_089|p340|The money will go straight to the headteacher.
p340_248|p340|Can they be serious?
p340_260|p340|They were his words.
p340_274|p340|The second half was a different affair.
p340_275|p340|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p340_261|p340|Shelter also supports the reform.
p340_249|p340|We've got to get this right.
p340_088|p340|There was no hint of scandal.
p340_077|p340|Two options are being proposed.
p340_063|p340|Together, we can make a difference.
p340_103|p340|He almost admitted as much.
p340_117|p340|We have got to the top.
p340_301|p340|There is a lot of fear.
p340_315|p340|I'm going to win the next two.
p340_329|p340|They worked on it for three hours.
p340_372|p340|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
p340_414|p340|It means a huge amount.
p340_400|p340|They were not defeated.
p340_366|p340|The past is history, not destiny.
p340_399|p340|I reported it but nothing was done.
p340_170|p340|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
p340_164|p340|My brother is not like that.
p340_158|p340|He was as good as his word.
p340_004|p340|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p340_010|p340|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p340_038|p340|This is my personal assessment.
p340_206|p340|They are very clever and very dangerous.
p340_212|p340|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p340_213|p340|It was properly reported to us.
p340_207|p340|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p340_039|p340|It is a recipe for success.
p340_011|p340|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p340_005|p340|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p340_159|p340|It will not happen overnight.
p340_165|p340|He was very fit.
p340_171|p340|He had no previous convictions.
p340_398|p340|Detectives are still working on the case.
p340_401|p340|There was much to be positive about.
p340_367|p340|I love it here.
p340_373|p340|War is not the action.
p340_415|p340|There are two interests in this woodland.
p340_365|p340|We wanted to do something different.
p340_403|p340|I had a ball today.
p340_417|p340|It is a good result.
p340_371|p340|He was not entirely correct.
p340_359|p340|It all happened so quickly.
p340_167|p340|It is clear that change is required.
p340_173|p340|And did they have sex?
p340_198|p340|This is a disaster for us.
p340_013|p340|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p340_007|p340|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p340_211|p340|The family baton is handed on.
p340_205|p340|That's my daughter acting.
p340_239|p340|They are now collapsing.
p340_238|p340|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p340_204|p340|Why does he do it?
p340_210|p340|I had just taken it off.
p340_006|p340|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p340_012|p340|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p340_199|p340|What does that mean?
p340_172|p340|It is no more than a shell.
p340_166|p340|It was very exciting.
p340_358|p340|The time was right.
p340_416|p340|I was frustrated here.
p340_370|p340|It is a tragedy for the area.
p340_364|p340|It simply doesn't happen.
p340_402|p340|It wants them to go home.
p340_348|p340|I am an innocent man.
p340_406|p340|It is the end of an era.
p340_360|p340|It is working well.
p340_374|p340|There are not enough of them.
p340_412|p340|And Scotland is no different.
p340_162|p340|He, too, will return.
p340_176|p340|It should be scrapped.
p340_189|p340|Yet it seemed to work.
p340_016|p340|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p340_002|p340|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p340_228|p340|I don't like to fail.
p340_214|p340|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
p340_200|p340|This is your life.
p340_201|p340|He has seen the past.
p340_215|p340|The seller was not revealed.
p340_229|p340|I really didn't think he would.
p340_003|p340|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p340_017|p340|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
p340_188|p340|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p340_177|p340|It gives us hope.
p340_163|p340|What then is wrong?
p340_375|p340|It has been a frustrating one.
p340_413|p340|The power of religion is so strong.
p340_407|p340|We shall not do that.
p340_361|p340|They really want to do it.
p340_349|p340|The improvement today was fantastic.
p340_411|p340|And it will be a challenge.
p340_377|p340|But we wouldn't want them any other way.
p340_363|p340|Governments will have to respond.
p340_405|p340|He said no survivors had been found.
p340_388|p340|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p340_149|p340|And he listens to his artists as well.
p340_175|p340|It was very close.
p340_161|p340|He has to learn.
p340_029|p340|But it's not just about that.
p340_001|p340|Please call Stella.
p340_015|p340|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p340_203|p340|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
p340_217|p340|How can this be?
p340_216|p340|Everything happened so quickly.
p340_202|p340|He can be beaten.
p340_014|p340|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p340_028|p340|It's a horrific incident.
p340_160|p340|Surely it can't get any worse.
p340_174|p340|But he was a really nice man.
p340_148|p340|They are working very well.
p340_389|p340|IT had to happen.
p340_362|p340|He said nothing of the sort.
p340_404|p340|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
p340_410|p340|Once again, he refused.
p340_376|p340|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
