p304_225|p304|I see no reason for them to be.
p304_231|p304|It might not survive the process.
p303_067|p303|Most people know that.
p303_073|p303|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p335_059|p335|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p335_071|p335|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p361_113|p361|He is a pro.
p361_107|p361|Music is all consuming.
s5_060|s5|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
s5_074|s5|I can understand fully that Rangers and Celtic want to progress.
p333_008|p333|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p333_020|p333|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334_262|p334|That, he claimed, was essential.
p334_276|p334|This is a lie.
p302_274|p302|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p302_260|p302|I started on a fire a couple of times.
p305_036|p305|People ask about the concept of a team.
p305_022|p305|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p351_154|p351|If you can work, you should work.
p351_140|p351|I think we can overcome it.
p360_328|p360|He refused to name the survivors.
p360_300|p360|Is it all real?
p277_243|p277|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p277_257|p277|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p283_242|p283|I had relied on him.
p283_256|p283|It could be to do with the location.
p248_108|p248|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p248_120|p248|They've got to account for it.
p284_014|p284|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
p284_028|p284|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p270_001|p270|Please call Stella.  
p270_015|p270|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p246_017|p246|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p246_003|p246|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p279_374|p279|That's the name of the game, though.
p279_360|p279|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p241_269|p241|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p241_255|p241|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p225_358|p225|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p225_172|p225|Nobody did in those days.
p240_046|p240|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p240_052|p240|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p247_238|p247|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p247_204|p247|They have the cash and the fire power.
p278_198|p278|I had come back from London.
p278_167|p278|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p271_212|p271|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p271_206|p271|Tommy is not a problem.
p285_213|p285|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p285_207|p285|It's not before time.
p282_051|p282|It is bizarre.
p282_045|p282|They want to be entertained.
p276_050|p276|But not a penny has been paid.
p276_044|p276|This is slightly negative for inflation.
p249_327|p249|He was then replaced by Ross.
p249_119|p249|It was ugly.
p254_338|p254|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p254_310|p254|It is out there.
p298_230|p298|This could be one such case, he declared.
p298_224|p298|I was living with my mum.
p253_191|p253|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p253_185|p253|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p265_187|p265|Is that success?
p265_193|p265|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p262_306|p262|One was a lawyer.
p262_312|p262|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p236_264|p236|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p236_502|p236|I stayed away from the defence.
p231_026|p231|I'd just like to play.
p231_032|p231|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p238_435|p238|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p238_353|p238|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
p263_115|p263|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p263_101|p263|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p297_114|p297|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p297_100|p297|The body follows the mind.
p264_394|p264|His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.
p264_380|p264|I have been going through a lot of things.
p299_023|p299|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p299_037|p299|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p252_382|p252|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
p252_396|p252|The new manager must make tough decisions.
p255_103|p255|Before the game we went for a pint.
p255_117|p255|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p239_140|p239|So it was at Easter Road.
p239_154|p239|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p230_235|p230|It is the voice of the survivors.
p230_221|p230|What do we want to do that for?
p237_088|p237|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p237_077|p237|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p345_202|p345|But who is the killer?
p345_216|p345|And we will do it.
p374_095|p374|That, though, is not true.
p374_081|p374|and their remit is limited.
p318_015|p318|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p318_001|p318|Please call Stella.
p316_122|p316|That would depend on the parole board.
p316_136|p316|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
p329_269|p329|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p329_241|p329|I was happiest with my short game.
p311_406|p311|I was frustrated here.
p311_360|p311|What does he want him to look like?
p343_290|p343|The princess has had other health problems.
p343_284|p343|Would they work together again?
p310_198|p310|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p310_173|p310|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p317_331|p317|It is still with Ministers.
p317_325|p317|I am not even thinking about that.
p326_159|p326|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p326_165|p326|We all have to look in the mirror.
p300_198|p300|Both of them have looked good.
p300_167|p300|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p307_325|p307|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p307_331|p307|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p336_159|p336|Who do you think you are?
p336_171|p336|However, they should not come as a surprise.
p364_081|p364|That would be a big mistake.
p364_095|p364|It was good to score the goal today.
p363_228|p363|But we shall have to talk to him.
p363_200|p363|It was a horrible moment.
p308_001|p308|Please call Stella.
p308_015|p308|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330_108|p330|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p330_120|p330|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p339_269|p339|They have to live with the risk.
p339_255|p339|Why is this?
p306_136|p306|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p306_122|p306|I will speak to Michael about this.
p301_374|p301|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p301_406|p301|Jackson may well be right.
p287_100|p287|You had better believe it.
p287_114|p287|We have a training class.
p273_101|p273|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p273_115|p273|His job was not advertised.
p274_380|p274|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p274_394|p274|The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.
p280_381|p280|This is not a small amount of money.
p280_395|p280|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p245_117|p245|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p245_103|p245|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p229_154|p229|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p229_140|p229|They took a risk.
p227_088|p227|We will deal with the refugees.
p227_063|p227|We will pay their bills.
p244_338|p244|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p244_304|p244|Every one is a winner.
p243_185|p243|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p243_191|p243|You are not long home from work.
p288_224|p288|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p288_230|p288|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p281_192|p281|You know the sort of thing.
p281_186|p281|I am not ready to walk away.
p275_193|p275|Peace was won.
p275_187|p275|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p272_312|p272|It will work.
p272_306|p272|You may have a short memory.
p286_313|p286|The rescue package is public money.
p286_307|p286|It was simply no contest.
p226_270|p226|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p226_264|p226|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p228_347|p228|She is free.
p228_353|p228|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p232_126|p232|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p232_132|p232|I am now unemployed.
p250_052|p250|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p250_046|p250|How are you, sir?
p268_198|p268|They have inherited the human rights abusers.
p268_173|p268|Is it in the right place?
p257_238|p257|They may yet have the last laugh.
p257_210|p257|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p295_207|p295|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p295_213|p295|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p261_206|p261|how do you get it back?
p261_212|p261|I won't make an official complaint.
p259_469|p259|It was like someone had died.
p259_441|p259|It was submitted without their knowledge.
p266_044|p266|A neighbour said.
p266_050|p266|There was a substantial explosion.
p292_045|p292|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p292_051|p292|Five officers were injured.
p234_177|p234|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p234_163|p234|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p233_335|p233|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p233_321|p233|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p258_108|p258|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p258_134|p258|My conscience is not clear.
p293_256|p293|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p293_242|p293|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p267_257|p267|It was a cry for help.
p267_243|p267|The irony was not lost.
p260_015|p260|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
p260_001|p260|Please call Stella.  
p294_014|p294|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p294_028|p294|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p269_360|p269|It should be scrapped.
p269_374|p269|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p256_003|p256|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
p256_017|p256|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
p251_269|p251|Kirkwood was arrested.
p251_241|p251|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p323_008|p323|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p323_034|p323|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
p312_260|p312|It has to be long-term commitment.
p312_274|p312|It was a new ball game.
p341_140|p341|They really did a great job.
p341_154|p341|He came in an army uniform.
p314_231|p314|She was a delightful person.
p314_225|p314|The island will never recover.
p313_073|p313|It really has left the town in shock.
p313_067|p313|Sandy was very active.
p376_379|p376|It is best value.
p376_345|p376|I did not feel the pressure.
p347_111|p347|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p347_105|p347|That's why he visited.
p340_353|p340|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p340_421|p340|We made a world record together.
